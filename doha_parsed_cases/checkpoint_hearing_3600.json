On May 22, 2023, DOHA \nissued a notice of video teleconference hearing, scheduling the hearing on June 29, 2023. \nThe hearing was held as scheduled. At the hearing, I considered Applicant\u2019s testimony, \ntogether with seven Government Exhibits (GE), marked and incorporated into the record as \nGE 1 through GE 7. The transcript (Tr.) was received on July 13, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 68-year-old married man with four adult children. A previous marriage \nfrom 1981 to 2015 ended in divorce. Applicant earned a GED in 1976, and is a veteran of \nthe U.S. Marine Corps, serving from 1976 to 1980. His discharge was honorable. Currently, \nhe works for a federal government contractor as a systems administrator. (GE 1 at 12, 28) \nBetween 1992 and 1994, Applicant molested his stepdaughter. The sexual abuse \noccurred when she was a young teenager and did not end until she left home to go to \ncollege. (Tr. 18) These episodes of sex abuse occurred approximately 24 to 48 times. (GE \n4 at 32) Per Applicant, \u201cwhile [he] did molest [his] then teenage daughter 28 years ago, it \nwas through inappropriately touching her and having her inappropriately touch me, not the \nsexual molestation, as suggest[ed].\u201d (Answer at 2) \nApplicant\u2019s stepdaughter did not report the abuse while a child. Shortly after \nattending therapy as an adult, she confronted Applicant, then told her mother. Shortly \nthereafter, in 2015, Applicant and his wife divorced. (Tr 28) Applicant contends that his \nstepdaughter has since forgiven him, and that he will [n]ever fall prey to [this conduct] \nagain.\u201d (Answer at 2) He has never attended any behavioral counseling. (Tr. 29) When \nconfronted by an investigative agent in March 2020 about this conduct, he initially denied \nthis activity occurred. (Tr. 29-30) He did not disclose the activity until asked a third time. He \nlied about this conduct because he was embarrassed. (Tr. 30) \nIn February 2012, Applicant was terminated from his employment after testing \npositive for cocaine. (GE 4 at 13) He denies that he has ever used cocaine and contends \nthat the test result was unreliable because it was conducted at an unsanctioned health \nclinic out of the country. (Answer at 2) Applicant was working out of the country at the time. \nThere is no additional record evidence of any additional failed drug tests, nor is there any \nother evidence that Applicant may have used illegal drugs in the past. \nApplicant has approximately $58,000 in delinquent debt. (Answer at 4) He attributes \nhis financial problems to several months of unemployment between 2017 and 2018. He \nadmits all of the financial debts alleged in the SOR but has done nothing to satisfy them. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988).

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. ...\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior \nUnder this guideline, \u201csexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack \nof judgment or discretion; or \u201cmay subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress\u201d is a security concern. Applicant\u2019s molestation of his stepdaughter \ntriggers the application of AG \u00b6 13(a), \u201csexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe individual has been prosecuted; and AG \u00b6 13(c), \u201csexual behavior that causes an \nindividual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress.\u201d \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 14: \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such \nunusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n(c) the behavior no l onger serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating the \nbehavior is readily controllable with treatment; \nApplicant was an adult when he sexually abused his stepdaughter. AG \u00b6 14(a) does \nnot apply. \nApplicant\u2019s behavior occurred nearly 30 years ago, and there is no evidence of any \nrecurrent conduct. Conversely, the nature and seriousness of the conduct is extraordinary, \nas he molested his then-teenage stepdaughter nearly 50 times over a two-year period. \nCompounding the seriousness of the conduct, he was never held criminally liable for the \nconduct, he has never engaged in therapy, and he believes that the conduct was somehow \nless egregious because it was limited to inappropriate touching rather than sexual \nintercourse. Moreover, when confronted about the sexual abuse during his background \ninterview, he initially denied engaging in it. Consequently, the passage of time does not \nmitigate this behavior. I conclude that none of the remaining mitigating conditions as set \nforth above apply, and that Applicant has failed to mitigate the sexual behavior security \nconcerns. \nGuideline E: Drug Involvement \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) \nApplicant\u2019s misconduct as discussed under the Guideline D analysis also generates \na security concern under AG \u00b6 16(e), \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information \nabout one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \na foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(e) is also triggered by \nApplicant\u2019s 2012 failure of a drug test. \nGiven Applicant\u2019s lack of credibility when confronted about his history of sexually \nabusing his stepdaughter, I do not find his explanation regarding the reliability of the \nadministration of the drug test credible. Nevertheless, there is no record evidence that \nApplicant abused cocaine before or after testing positive for it in 2012. Under these \ncircumstances, AG \u00b6 17(c), \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment,\u201d applies. I resolve subparagraph 2.b in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nApplicant\u2019s sexual misconduct is disqualifying under Guideline E for the same \nreasons as those set forth in the Guideline D analysis discussed earlier. \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18) \nOver the years, Applicant has incurred approximately $58,000 of delinquent debt \nthat remains outstanding. Under these circumstances, AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy \ndebts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting\u2019s financial obligations,\u201d apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant contends that these debts corresponded with a lengthy period of \nunemployment between 2017 and 2018.  Even if this assertion is true, Applicant provided \nno evidence of any effort to satisfy these debts or to otherwise dispose of them. I conclude \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nthat none of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant has failed to mitigate the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have considered the whole-person factors in my analysis of the facts, and they do \nnot warrant a favorable conclusion. Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a \u2013 3.y: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nConsidering the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He received his bachelor\u2019s degree in 1999. He worked as a \njournalist for the same publication for 20 years; a job he began one week after graduating \ncollege. He held various positions as the publication became a subsidiary of several \ncompanies over the years until December 2018, when his position was eliminated. He \nwas unemployed until June 2019. He decided to pursue a new career path and has been \nemployed as a communications specialist by a defense contractor since June 2019. This \nis his first application for a security clearance. (GE 1; GE 2 at 6; Tr. at 9, 26-28, 29, 37, \n43) \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for tax years \n(TY) 2012 through 2020. As of the date of the SOR, he had filed his TY 2017 returns and \nthe other returns remained unfiled. Since then, he has filed all delinquent returns with the \nhelp of a professional tax preparer. Tax account transcripts confirmed that the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS) received his TY 2017 returns on May 28, 2021; TY 2019, 2020, \nand 2021 on September 19, 2022; TY 2013 and 2018 on September 27, 2022; and TY \n2014 and 2016 on September 28, 2022. Although the IRS had not yet confirmed receipt, \nhe credibly testified that he filed paper returns for TY 2015 on September 15, 2022; and \nTY 2012 on October 3, 2022. Additionally, he was unable to obtain confirmation from the \nstate; however, he credibly testified that he filed his state returns with his federal returns. \n(AE B-H; Tr. at 61) \nOn his June 7, 2019 SCA, Applicant attributed the delay in filing his returns for TY \n2012 through 2018 to unemployment and having \u201cmissed [the] deadline.\u201d He explained, \nI need to consult a tax advisor to file back income taxes; have been unable \nto do so without funds . . . I am very much aware that my lack of filing income \ntaxes is a severe issue that I need to address ASAP and will be doing so \nimmediately upon regaining employment. I have not, in any way, been \ncontacted by either the [Internal Revenue Service (IRS)] or [state] for owing \nof taxes and believe I do not currently owe state or federal income tax as I \nclaimed no exemptions with my employers since 2001.

He reiterated that he did not believe that he owed any taxes for the \nyears he failed to file his returns, because he was claiming zero tax deductions from his \npaychecks. He asserted that he was willing to repay any tax debt owed. He anticipated \nthat once he successfully obtained a professional to assist him, he would be able to file \nthe delinquent returns. He asserted that he would never file late again. (GE 2 at 4) \nIn his September 20, 2021 response to DOHA-issued interrogatories, Applicant \nstated that he had been working with a professional tax preparer. However, due to the \nCOVID-19 pandemic, the process was taking longer than he originally anticipated. At the \nhearing, he explained that it was not until he received the interrogatories that he realized \nthe potential negative impact on his security clearance. (GE 2 at 7; Tr. at 25) \nApplicant attributed his delayed filings to the \u201csnowball\u201d effect of him missing the \ndeadline to file his TY 2012 returns. He had successfully filed his returns using an online \ntax software program prior to TY 2012. For reasons he could not explain or recall, he \nmissed the deadline for TY 2012 and \u201cdid not think to file late.\u201d Then, the software would \nnot allow him to input data for TY 2013 without the data for TY 2012, which he did not \nhave. He did not make any further efforts to file his TY 2012 or 2013 returns until after he \ncompleted his SCA in June 2019. (GE 1; GE 2 at 7; Tr. at 16, 39, 41, 43) \nApplicant accepted full responsibility for what he called a \u201cvery stupid, very foolish \nmistake\u201d in failing to timely file his returns and to initiate action to resolve the delinquent \nreturns sooner. With respect to reasons for his persistent delays, he stated, \u201cI am not \nmaking any excuse for my actions whatsoever,\u201d and \u201c[t]there\u2019s nothing that I am going to \nsay that does not sound stupid.\u201d He acknowledged that he did not \u201ctake it seriously \nenough\u201d until \u201cfinally getting smacked by having to find another job.\u201d He explained that \nwhen he saw the question on the SCA asking whether he had timely filed his tax returns, \nhe realized the repercussions of failing to do so. Prior to seeing that question, he \nunderstood that he had a requirement to file his returns. However, he had not prioritized \ndoing so because he did not anticipate owing any taxes. In all the years that he filed \nincome tax returns, he only ever owed taxes one time in the amount of about $178 in \nabout 2004 or 2005, due to an error his employer made on his tax-withholding form. He \nassumed that the IRS or state would reach out to him if he owed any money. He never \nreceived any notices or communications about his missing returns and never followed up \nwith either the IRS or his state. (GE 2 at 7; Tr. at 16-17, 23, 31, 40, 43-44) \nAfter Applicant completed his SCA and before his SI, he conducted internet \nsearches to see what needed to be done to rectify his delayed filings. Although he did not \nrecall the specific dates, he attempted reaching out to his wife\u2019s tax preparer prior to hiring \nher in May 2021. However, the COVID-19 pandemic impaired their ability to connect, \nbecause she was only working with current clients at the time. He wanted to hire the same \ntax preparer that his wife (filing separate returns) and her parents used. (GE 2 at 4; Tr. at \n33, 51-54, 64-66) \nApplicant attributed his lack of action to resolve his delinquent returns between the \ntime he completed his SCA and when he initially reached out to his tax preparer to a lack \nof funds and COVID-19-related delays.

Once he became \nemployed in 2019, he prioritized getting caught up on bills that had fallen behind during \nhis period of unemployment. He also wanted to build a \u201cfinancial cushion.\u201d (GE 2 at 4; Tr. \nat 33, 51-54, 64-66) \nBefore being laid off, Applicant earned $59,000 annually. After he was laid off in \nSeptember 2018, the unemployment compensation and the monthly installments he \nreceived as part of his $9,000 severance package were insufficient to meet his expenses. \nAlthough he could not recall exactly how much the monthly installments were, he \nestimated that they were just about enough to pay his mortgage and nothing else. He \nended up paying $1,000 to the tax preparer in one lump sum via his wife\u2019s credit card, \nbecause he and his wife could not afford to pay cash. He did not want to borrow from his \n401k due to excessive taxes he would incur. He preferred not to pay the tax preparer in \ninstallments. As of the hearing, he had about $1,000 in savings and earned an annual \nsalary of $61,000. His wife earned about $55,000 annually. He explained that they \ngenerally do not have funds left over after paying two car payments, their mortgage, and \ngroceries. (Tr. at 37-38, 47, 64-72) \nApplicant hired the tax preparer on May 11, 2021, at which time he also delivered \nall the necessary tax information for her to file his TY 2012 through 2020 returns. That \nsame day, she was able to prepare and file his TY 2017 returns. She anticipated that she \nwould be able to turn her attention to the remaining returns in \u201cabout a month or two.\u201d \nHowever, that timeline was delayed because \u201cshe had fallen severely ill.\u201d They connected \nagain in August 2021, but she was further delayed due apparently to some inattention on \nher part and the nature of the task. Because he believed she was doing him a \u201chuge favor\u201d \nin remedying his voluminous late filings, he felt it would be \u201crude\u201d to rush her. However, \nonce he found out that he would be having a hearing, he contacted her, at which time she \napologized for the delay, and \u201cthen she put her foot on the gas and got everything squared \naway [sic] she possibly could.\u201d (GE 1; GE 2 at 7; Tr. at 32, 53-57) \nApplicant delivered his TY 2021 information to the tax preparer in a timely manner, \nbut she delayed filing it to finalize earlier returns and then filed them together. He currently \nhas no outstanding federal or state tax debt. After filing all his returns, TY 2014 was the \nonly year in which he owed any income taxes. Immediately upon receipt of a $62 bill from \nthe IRS for TY 2014, he paid it in November 2022. Then, in March 2023, $408 of his \n$1,505 TY 2022 refund was applied to the balance owed for TY 2014 penalties and \ninterest. He filed his TY 2022 return early. He plans to continue using the same tax \npreparer to ensure that his returns are timely filed in the future. (AE B-H; Tr. at 54, 61, 72-\n73, 85)  \nApplicant understands the importance of filing his returns on time. He loves his \ncountry and enjoys serving and promoting the military through his work. He described \nhimself as an honest and trustworthy person. With respect to his delayed filings, he \nasserted that he \u201cnever consciously thought that I\u2019m going to pull one over on the \nGovernment. I never did this maliciously.\u201d He also asserted, \u201cI understand and realize \nwholeheartedly that my initial actions were neglectful, but I have taken action that will \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nensure I never, ever find myself in an even remotely similar position again.\u201d His direct \nsupervisor wrote a letter praising his trustworthiness and work performance.

(AE A, B; Tr. at 24, 42, 84-85) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan at 531). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d \nis \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington Metro. Area \nTransit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a nexus or \nrational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and \nan applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the \nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.

Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd.

Immediately upon receipt of a bill \nfrom the IRS, he paid $62 in November 2022 for TY 2014. He currently has no outstanding \nfederal or state tax debt. AG \u00b6 20(g) is established. \nApplicant\u2019s inaction in the five years between 2013 and when he lost his job was \na serious error in judgment, which is particularly problematic in the context of evaluating \nhis security worthiness. This willingness to place his own self-interest above his legal\nobligation over so many years raised doubts as to whether he may also act similarly in\nthe context of his security obligations. His period of unemployment and the COVID-19-\npandemic were circumstances beyond his control and provide mitigation for his inaction \nfrom December 2018 forward. However, procrastination and avoidance surrounding his\ntax obligations played a more significant role in his filing delays. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not\nestablished. \n \n \n \n \nApplicant did not prioritize filing his tax returns before 2019 because he did not \nanticipate owing any taxes. This widely held belief that not owing taxes somehow excuses \neither non-filing or belated filing of tax returns is not a viable factor to mitigate the security \nconcerns under this Guideline. However, in this case, there are other factors that weigh \nin his favor. \nThis was Applicant\u2019s first security clearance application and first experience with \nthe defense industry. Once he realized the error of his mistaken belief, he took action to \nfind solutions to remedy his delinquent returns. While he may have been better served by \nengaging another tax preparer sooner, it was not unreasonable for him to wait to hire the \nsame person used by his wife and her parents. He engaged a professional tax preparer \nto remedy his delinquent returns before the SOR was issued and before he realized the \npotential impact on his security clearance. Thereafter, he filed his delinquent returns \nwithin a reasonable period, considering the voluminous nature of the task, the COVID-19 \npandemic, and delays attributable to his tax preparer. He was forthcoming with his \nsupervisor about this issue. He credibly and candidly testified about the circumstances \nsurrounding his failure to timely file his tax returns. He offered no excuses and accepted \nfull responsibility for his error in judgment and his prior inaction. He demonstrated a \ncommitment to ongoing compliance with his tax obligations by timely providing his TY \n2021 tax information to his tax preparer and by filing his TY 2022 return early. His previous \ninaction was not motivated by a willful violation of his legal obligations and can reasonably \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nbe attributed to circumstances unlikely to recur. I have no lingering doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(g) are established \nto mitigate the Guideline F concerns alleged in the SOR. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant was forthright about his error in \njudgment. Once the security clearance process with which he had no prior experience \nopened his eyes to the reality of his years of inaction, he demonstrated the good \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required of those granted access to classified \ninformation. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F \nand evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude that \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his failure to timely file federal \nand state tax income tax returns. Accordingly, Applicant has carried his burden of showing \nthat it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant him eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Applicant\u2019s admission is incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough \nand careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \nApplicant is 44 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2001 and a graduate \ncertificate in 2005. He has never been married and has no children. He has worked for \nhis current employer since early 2020 and has no periods of unemployment. He testified \nthat he has held secret and top-secret clearances in the past. He is also self-employed \nwith his own business. (Tr.18-20, 30; GE 1) \nIn 1998, Applicant filed Chapter 7 bankruptcy. He testified he had about $10,000 \nof credit card debt that was discharged. He said he learned from his mistakes. (Tr. 28-29, \n58, 60; GE 7) \nApplicant testified that in 2008 to 2010 he purchased three rental properties. In \napproximately 2015 he could no longer pay the mortgages on all three. He testified that \nhe was attempting to find an amicable resolution with the creditors, but he was unable, \nso he walked away from two of the properties and stopped paying the mortgages. He \nretained one property, because he said it was viable, but he could not provide information \nas to what happened with the other two properties when he defaulted on the payments. \nHe admitted the charged-off mortgage alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($67,844) but did not provide \nany information as to status of the property. It is reflected as charged off on his January \n2022 credit report. (Tr. 24-25, 47, 51-57; GE 2) \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b ($9,463) is a credit card debt from a home improvement \nstore. The creditor filed a lawsuit and a default judgment was entered against him in \nSeptember 2017. In Applicant\u2019s July 2018 statement to a government investigator, he \nacknowledged the legitimacy of the debt. He used this credit card to pay for maintenance \nand improvements for rental property he owned in approximately 2015. When he decided \nhe could no longer afford to keep the rental property, he stopped paying the credit card. \nHe told the investigator he could afford to pay it but had mentally erased it because it had \nto do with his foreclosed property.

Applicant testified that he has not had financial counseling. (Tr. \n41-46, 60; GE 2, 4, 6) \nIn Applicant\u2019s April 2017 security clearance application (SCA) he disclosed foreign \ntravel for pleasure from 2007 to 2017 (Brazil, Dominican Republic, Colombia, Thailand, \nCosta Rica, United Kingdom, Netherlands, Thailand, Bahamas, Costa Rica, and \nCanada). Many years he made multiple trips, and in 2016 he took seven trips for personal \nenjoyment. (Tr. 46-47, 50-51; GE 1) \nApplicant rented an apartment in 2019 and used it for his business. He did not live \nthere. He set up multiple computer servers. He was mining cryptocurrency at this office \nand estimated about 70% of the time the servers were actively mining, which used a \nsubstantial amount of power and energy. He had a large utility bill. He said when he rented \nthe premises the utilities were included. When the landlord learned he was operating a \nbusiness from the premises, he moved out. Applicant testified that he always paid his rent \non time. The debt is SOR \u00b6 1.a ($11,023) is the amount the landlord claims is owed for \nthe utility bill. Applicant said he moved out in 2019 because he had computer servers in \nthe apartment, and he was taking advantage of the electricity. He said he received \nsomething in the mail about the debt but could not remember when, and he spoke with \nthe creditor but could not resolve the debt. He said he had his lawyer draft a response to \nthe letter he received at the time, but the issue dropped from his mind since then. He did \nnot produce a copy of the letter. (Tr. 32-41; GE 5) \nApplicant received the SOR in February 2022 and the government\u2019s discovery in \nMarch 2022. GE 5 includes court documents for the lawsuit filed by the landlord regarding \nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant testified he was unaware it was part of a legal case. I \ndid not find him credible. The case has not been adjudicated. Applicant testified that he \ncould afford to pay this debt but disputes its legitimacy. (Tr. 32-41) \nApplicant provided numerous documents to show that he has substantial financial \nresources. His annual salary is approximately $140,000. He testified that in 2022 he \nnetted over $200,000 in income. The extra income was earned through his private \ncompany. He provided documents to show his investments and that he pays his bills \nautomatically and timely. He provided spreadsheets to show his detailed budget and his \nexcess expendable income each month to show he is fiscally responsible. He said he \ndoes not take financial risks that he cannot afford to lose. He drives a 20-year-old vehicle \nbecause he does not like car payments and only uses credit cards when he travels. He \nprovided documents to show that he has medical and dental insurance to support he is \nfinancially stable even if he encounters health issues. He provided documents to show \nhe goes to the gym. He provided a copy of his bank statement to show he has a current \ncash balance of approximately $32,200 as of March 2023.

(AE L, M) On April 23, 2023, he provided an email listing \nall of the entries on his January 2022 credit report and made comments about each entry. \nNext to the entry for SOR \u00b6 1.b he stated it was being paid. This credit report also reflects \nthe charged-off mortgage alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($67,844). Applicant stated in his email of \nApril 25, 2023, that he has held various different security clearances over the years and \nworked for different federal agencies. He loves his country. He said he cleared up any \nambiguities regarding his old credit report and he is thriving financially. He does not plan \non acquiring new debts and he will pay off his debts or pay on schedule as agreed. (AE \nO) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant chose to not pay his mortgage on a rental property because it was no \nlonger financially advantageous to him. He decided to not pay a credit card he used to \nmaintain the rental property because he had washed his hands of the property. He rented \na residential apartment and used it for business. He disputes he owes the utility bill \nbecause he believed it was included in his rent. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the debt. \nApplicant chose to ignore his responsibility regarding the mortgage payments on \nrental property he purchased because it was no longer financially viable. He kept the one \nproperty he thought was viable. He stopped making payments in 2015, and the mortgage \nwas foreclosed and charged off. He decided not to pay a credit card he used to maintain \nthe property because he no longer owned the property. He said he washed his hands of \nit. A default judgment was entered in September 2017. He received information about the \ndebt through discovery in March 2022. He provided a voluminous amount of information \nas to his financial worth and ability to pay his debts but waited until after his hearing to \nmake payment arrangements to resolve this debt. Despite having the means to repay the \nwhole amount, the length of time the debt has been owed, and a judgment that was \nentered almost six years ago, his arrangement is to make monthly payments over the \nnext two years. \nApplicant is being sued for the amount of utilities he used while operating a \nbusiness in a residential apartment. That suit has not yet been adjudicated. Post-hearing, \nApplicant provided a copy of a letter he sent to the court saying he would pay the debt. \nHe did not provide any other documents to show he is resolving the matter. He failed to \nprovide documented proof to substantiate the basis of his former dispute. He claimed he \nhad his lawyer send a letter to the creditor but he did not provide a copy. Based on his \npast conduct, his promise to the court to pay the debt in the future is insufficient to believe \nhe will act responsibly. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are ongoing, and based on his past conduct, I cannot find future \nissues are unlikely to recur. The debts were not beyond his control as he provided \nevidence of his substantial financial resources. He basically chose not to pay debts that \nhe legitimately owed. He has not received financial counseling. His post-hearing actions \nto pay a credit card that is years old and a promise to pay utilities owed for years is not \nconsidered good faith. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \nThe fact that Applicant has taken some action on his years\u2019 old debts after his \nhearing \u201cdoes not preclude careful consideration of Applicant\u2019s security worthiness based \non longstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12-05053 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014). An applicant who waits until his clearance is in jeopardy before \nresolving debts may be lacking in the judgment expected of those with access to classified \ninformation.

July 7, 2016) \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has not met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith serious questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is 39 years old. He is divorced (married from November 2006 to June \n2010) and has one child. He works for a civilian security firm. He is also a member of \nhis state\u2019s Army National Guard (NG). He joined the NG in August 2022. He \nequivocated as to whether he disclosed the information about his Marine Corps actions \ndescribed below to the NG upon his enlistment. He was awarded an associate\u2019s degree \nin 2014 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2020. He is also pursuing a master\u2019s degree. (Tr. \n19-21, 65-69; GE 1, 7; AE N; SOR answer) \nApplicant previously served in the U.S. Marine Corps. He was on active duty \nfrom 2005 to 2013, and then served in the Marine Reserve from 2013 to 2018. He was \nout of the military from February 2018 until he enlisted in the NG in August 2022. While \non active duty, he deployed to both Iraq and Afghanistan where he earned Combat \nAction Ribbons for service in those locations. He achieved the rank of sergeant (E-5) \nand was honorably discharged. He received a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) \ndisability rating of 90%, primarily for his diagnosis of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder \n(PTSD). (Tr. 20-22, 27-28; AE F) \nThe SOR alleged, under Guideline E, that Applicant falsified six military orders by \nforging the authorizing military official\u2019s signature and submitted those orders to two \nemployers in order to receive paid military leave. (SOR \u00b6 1.a). It also alleged that his \nactions, described above, caused his termination by one of those employers. (SOR \u00b6 \n1.b). I find that this allegation is duplicitous with SOR \u00b6 1.a in that the underlying \nconduct is the same. SOR \u00b6 1.b just alleges the consequences of that conduct. I find in \nfavor of Applicant regarding SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleged that in December 2015, Applicant was \nissued a written warning from his employer and placed on probation for using excessive \nforce in performing his duties (SOR \u00b6 2.a); that in February 2016, Applicant was \ncounseled for missing movement (Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) Article 87) \nwhen he failed to have a proper uniform for duty (SOR \u00b6 2.b); that in July 2017, \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was counseled for a violation of UCMJ Article 107, for providing false \nstatements to the Marine Corps with regard to his forged military orders described \nabove (SOR \u00b6 2.c); and that in January 2018, Applicant was charged with a felony \noffense of tampering with records by submitting the forged military orders to his civilian \nemployers, as described above (SOR \u00b6 2.d). \nApplicant admitted in his statements to a background investigator in June 2017 \nand November 2018, in his January 2022 SOR answer, and during his hearing \ntestimony, that at various times from 2015 through 2016, he forged six military training \norders representing that he would be performing military training with his Marine \nReserve unit and submitted those orders to two civilian employers he worked for at the \ntime so that he could financially benefit by classifying that time as military leave, for \nwhich he was paid. He did not perform military duties during the days indicated on the \nforged orders. One civilian employer was a state agency and the other employer was a \ncounty sheriff\u2019s department. He submitted five forged orders to the state agency and \none order to the sheriff\u2019s department. (Tr. 23; GE 2; SOR answer) \nHe accomplished the forgeries in the following manner: \n1. He searched Google for examples of Marine Corp training orders; \n2. Having found the orders, he supplied his name as the subject of the order, \nalthough he fraudulently listed his rank as either a first lieutenant or captain, \nwhen he was actually a sergeant; \n3. He forged or fraudulently supplied the name of the order authorizing official on \nthe orders; \n4. He submitted these forged orders five times to his state agency employer and \nonce to his sheriff\u2019s department employer; \n5. GE 6 contains three examples of the orders Applicant admitted forging; \n6. He benefitted financially by receiving \u201cmilitary leave\u201d from his civilian \nemployers for those days and he did not perform any military duties for his \nMarine Reserve unit for the days indicated on the forged orders;  \n7. He did not pay back either employer for the military leave benefit he received. \nHe did not disclose his actions until after he was caught through his employer\u2019s \ninvestigation. (Tr. 31-34, 40-44-51, 69-70; GE 5-6) \nApplicant justified his forging of the orders because he believed both his civilian \nemployers were not properly paying employees for overtime hours they worked. He was \nalso having financial difficulties during that time frame arising from his spousal and child \nsupport obligations, which were about $2,000 per month.

He was investigated and charged by the state with the felony charge of \ntampering with a record in January 2018. The charge was dismissed in April 2018 and \nan expunction order was issued in September 2020. In July 2017, Applicant\u2019s Marine \ncommander was made aware of the forged orders and disciplined Applicant by issuing \nhim a formal written letter of counseling for making false official statements in \nconnection with the orders he forged, in violation of UCMJ Article 107. He quit \nperforming Marine Reserve duties shortly after this counseling. (Tr. 61, 64; GE 3, 5, 7; \nAE E; SOR answer) \nIn December 2015, Applicant was given a written warning by his state-agency \nemployer and placed on probation because he used excessive force on an inmate by \nspraying the inmate with a full can of pepper spray while he was inside his cell. \nApplicant explained his action was in self-defense because he believed the inmate was \ntrying to secure a tool that was potentially dangerous as Applicant was attempting to \nserve the inmate his meal. The inmate was trying to access the tool through the cell tray \nopening slot. Applicant was not criminally charged with an offense. (Tr. 73-74; GE 2; \nSOR answer) \nIn February 2016, Applicant reported for his Marine Reserve duty weekend. He \nforgot his physical training (PT) uniform. His home was located approximately five hours \nfrom his duty location. He informed his first sergeant about forgetting his PT gear and \nwas given two options. He could go back home and retrieve his PT gear and miss a day \nof drill (and the payment for it), or he could stay and be formally counseled for not \nshowing up for drill with the proper uniform, in violation of UCMJ Article 87. Applicant \nchose the latter option and was counseled. He admitted this conduct. (Tr. 30; GE 2; \nSOR Answer) \nApplicant presented awards and commendations from his Marine Corps service; \nperformance evaluations from his civilian employer in 2022 and 2021, which reflect \noverall evaluations of \u201cexceeding standards;\u201d letters documenting his community service \nas a volunteer; and a letter of appreciation from his Marine commander in 2009 \nrecognizing Applicant\u2019s outstanding contribution to the battalion. (AE F-M, O) \nAny misconduct described above that was not specifically alleged in the SOR will \nnot be used for disqualification purposes. It may be used to assess credibility, determine \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions, and in making my whole-person determination. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThe record evidence is sufficient for an adverse determination under the criminal \nconduct guideline, nevertheless, as a whole, Applicant\u2019s actions put into issue his \njudgment, trustworthiness and overall personal conduct, as expressed in the general \nsecurity concern in and the specific concern expressed in AG \u00b6 16(c). Applicant\u2019s \nforgery of military orders for his personal benefit on multiple occasions, involving two \nseparate employers, raises questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and \njudgment. AG \u00b615 and AG \u00b6 16(c) apply to SOR \u00b6 1.a, but as noted above, SOR \u00b6 1.b \nis duplicitous, and I find for Applicant on that allegation. \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for personal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 17 and considered the following relevant: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \nAppellant\u2019s crimes of forging military orders in 2015-2016 were not minor events \nnor were they infrequent. They involved a calculated plan by Applicant to defraud his \ncivilian employers of military leave benefits, which he did not earn. Although Applicant \nacknowledged his behavior, he did not come forward on his own, but only disclosed his \ncrimes once he had been caught. He equivocated on whether his NG unit is aware of \nhis previous crimes forging military orders. His reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment are still in question. Applicant receives some credit under AG \u00b6 17(d), but AG \n\u00b6 17(c) does not apply. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for criminal conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following is potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted.  \nThe allegation describing Applicant\u2019s use of excessive force on the job was in the \nnature of a job performance issue, not a criminal offense. I find for Applicant regarding \nSOR \u00b6 2.a. Additionally, while Applicant\u2019s failure to bring PT gear on his drill weekend \nmay have technically been a criminal offense, I find that it does not rise to the level of \nhaving security significance and find for Applicant regarding SOR \u00b6 2.b. \nApplicant\u2019s actions in forging military orders on multiple occasions was charged \nunder state law, where he was formally charged with tampering with a record; and \nunder the UCMJ, where he was disciplined for making false official statements. AG \u00b6 \n31(b) applies to both SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c and 2.d. \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for criminal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 32 and considered the following relevant: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement.  \nSee earlier discussion under AG \u00b6 17 as also applying here. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and \n32(d) do not fully apply. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s combat \nservice, his apparent diagnosis of PTSD, his awards and decorations, the passage of \ntime since his actions, his letter of recommendation, and his community involvement. \nHowever, he also used his military position to benefit himself in a premeditated plan to \ndefraud two different employers by forging orders that allowed him to receive military \nleave benefits. His trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment are very much in \nquestion. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guidelines E and J. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs   1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph     1.b: \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs   2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs   2.c \u2013 2d.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant's admissions in his Answer are incorporated in my findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a twice divorced 44-year-old employee of defense contractor. He has an adult-aged son from his first marriage. He married again in 2013 and separated from his second spouse in May 2017. The divorce was final in 2019. There are two minor-aged children from his second marriage. There were also two stepchildren from the second marriage. (Tr. at 121-122; GE 1 at 36-38) He was granted a security clearance in 2008, again in 2011, and again in July 2015. (GE 2 at 52; Tr. at 123.) SOR \u00b6 1.a: August 2021, charged with driving while license suspended. In his Answer, Applicant denied the charge, as to the date listed, but admitted the underlying conduct. He stated that mitigating circumstances applied. He noted the underlying incident, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, occurred over five years ago. He acknowledged that his driving privileges had been suspended in another state, after he pled guilty to driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI).

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on May 16, 2018. On \nApril 5, 2022, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging security concerns under Guidelines J and G. The DoD acted under Executive \nOrder (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) (December \n10, 2016). \nThe Government amended the SOR on April 19, 2022.

(Tr. at 14.) \nThe Government\u2019s disclosure letter to Applicant dated July 5, 2022, the Government\u2019s \nExhibit List, and a post-hearing email exchange are marked as hearing exhibits (HE) I \nthrough III. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 10 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection.

DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) electronically on May 17, 2023. \nI kept the record open after the hearing to enable the parties to submit additional \ndocumentary evidence.

(HE III.) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant's admissions in his Answer are incorporated in my findings of fact. After \na thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make \nthe following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a twice divorced 44-year-old employee of defense contractor. He has \nan adult-aged son from his first marriage. He married again in 2013 and separated from \nhis second spouse in May 2017. The divorce was final in 2019. There are two minor-aged \nchildren from his second marriage. There were also two stepchildren from the second \nmarriage. (Tr. at 121-122; GE 1 at 36-38) He was granted a security clearance in 2008, \nagain in 2011, and again in July 2015. (GE 2 at 52; Tr. at 123.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: August 2021, charged with driving while license suspended. In his \nAnswer, Applicant denied the charge, as to the date listed, but admitted the underlying \nconduct. He stated that mitigating circumstances applied. He noted the underlying \nincident, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, occurred over five years ago. He acknowledged that his \ndriving privileges had been suspended in another state, after he pled guilty to driving \nunder the influence of alcohol (DUI). He said that he had failed to satisfy all the \nrequirements of his sentence, which included documenting that he had completed a court-\nordered program and paid the required processing fee. (Tr. at 169.) His suspension was \nflagged by his home state\u2019s department of motor vehicles (DMV), which resulted in \nsuspension of his home state driver\u2019s license. He took the steps necessary to reinstate \nhis driving privileges in the state where he had received the DUI. (Tr at 77.) He then was \nable to go to his DMV and get his license reinstated. (Tr. at 169.) He stated he was never \ninformed about the license suspension in his home state because the notice had been \nreturned to the DMV as undeliverable by the U.S. Postal Service. (Tr. at 77-78.) The \ncharge was dismissed without prejudice on December 3, 2021, after he provided the \nnecessary paperwork (Tr. at 78; AE G.) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: January 2018, charged with Breaking and Entering; Assault and \nBattery; and Abduction, and convicted of Assault and Battery and sentenced to \none year of imprisonment (with ten months suspended) and probation. In his \nAnswer Applicant admits being charged but disputes the accuracy of the charges while \nacknowledging full responsibility for his inappropriate actions, which resulted in him being \nindicted by a grand jury for a Class 5 Felony (Abduction) and a Class 1 Misdemeanor \n(Domestic Assault and Battery). (GE 7 at 6-7.) He pled guilty to the Class One \nMisdemeanor, Domestic Assault and Battery, and was sentenced to 12 months \nconfinement, with 10 months suspended. (GE 7 at 8-9.) He was allowed to serve the \nunsuspended portion of his confinement on the weekends. (Tr. at 164.) He asks that \nmitigating circumstances be considered. (Answer at 4.) \nAfter almost three years of separation from his spouse he entered her home in \nhopes of catching her with another man whom he believed to be a drug dealer. In a \nstatement to a deputy sheriff, he acknowledged that he knew he was not welcome in the \nhome and that it was a poor choice to try to go upstairs to find the man. (Tr. at 154-156; \nGE 4 at 15-16; GE 13 at 4, 5.) His spouse tried to stop him. (Tr. at 154) He stated he \nnever laid his hands on her. \u201cShe grabbed on to my belt and went for the ride. And \u2026I \nhad so much adrenaline going through me, I carried myself and her, with her dragging up \n(sic) the stairs with her holding on to my belt or my clothing or whatever it was, and \u2013 all \nthe way into the bedroom where she let go after we entered the door.\u201d (Tr. at 160.) His \nspouse and stepdaughter described him as dragging her upstairs by her wrists. (GE-13 \nat 4.) After verbally confronting the man, he left his spouse\u2019s home. Applicant attributed \nbruising on his spouse\u2019s wrists to their rough sex that they had engaged in earlier in the \nday and to her anemia that caused her to bruise easily. (Tr. at 158.) \nHe was arrested and held in jail for six days. (Tr. at 161.) He testified that he had \nnever laid a hand on his wife and had never raised his hand to a woman. (Tr. at 160.) He \nexplained that he only pled guilty to avoid possibly being sentenced to 20 years in prison \nand to have a chance to gain custody of his children, which he did. (Tr. at 168.) He stated: \n\u201cSo yes, I did plead guilty to it. But did I do it? No, I did not. That's that fine gray area in \nlife that, you know\u2026.\u201d (Tr. at 168.)1 \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 2.a: February 2017, charged with DUI; DUI with Blood Alcohol \nContent over .15; Evading; and Hit and Run Property Damage.

Relying on federal case law, the Appeal Board has \nadopted a three-part test to determine the appropriateness of applying collateral estoppel to misdemeanor \nconvictions. First, the applicant must have been afforded a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue in \nthe criminal trial. Second, the issues presented for collateral estoppel must be the same as those resolved \nagainst the applicant in the criminal trial.

(Answer; Tr. \nat 91; GE 1 at 43-45.) He notes that he reported the incident promptly to his security \nmanager and the accident resulted in no injuries and very little property damage to a \nbarrier. \nAt the hearing he explained that he decided to drink hard liquor instead of beer \nand when the bar did not have his preferred brand of rum, he was served rum with a \nhigher alcohol content. He said, \u201cI did not know that\u201d the rum had a higher alcohol content. \nHe stated that he ended up \u201cgetting inebriated\u201d and drove into a vehicle barrier. He was \nstopped and arrested by a sheriff\u2019s deputy. (Tr. at 91-92.) He pled guilty to DUI. His \nlicense was suspended for one year. He had to pay fines, court costs, attend a substance \nabuse program, and do 40 hours of community service, which he said that he completed. \n(Tr. at 92.) \nDuring his security clearance interview he told the investigator that he had been \ndrinking with a friend he had made. He stated that his friend had invited him to his \nresidence for a social gathering and that he had consumed a mixed drink. He did not \nrecall any additional information about the night due to blacking out. He stated that he \nbecame aware of his surroundings when he woke up in jail. (GE 4 at 8.) \nHe said that he does not \u201cdrink any kind of liquor whatsoever\u201d and if he does have \nany kind of alcohol, \u201cit is a couple beers, and that is it.\u201d He added that he drinks by himself \nin the privacy of his \u201cown home\u201d except for at company events where he drinks to be \nsocial.

(GE 2 at 43.) \nApplicant was pulled over for speeding. When the state trooper asked to search \nhis vehicle, he consented. (Tr. at 94.) He acknowledged that he had told the security \nclearance investigator in his 2017 interview that the state trooper said he smelled \nmarijuana in the car and requested to search the vehicle. (GE-2 at 42-43; Tr. at 144.) \nApplicant said that he did not smell marijuana because he had suffered multiple broken \nnoses and was a heavy smoker. He described the trooper\u2019s discovery \u201cas like the smallest \nlittle thing in a little bag, is what the police officer pulled out.\u201d (Tr. at 95.) The trooper \nreported detecting a strong odor of marijuana after pulling Applicant over for speeding \nand that Applicant told him that the marijuana was in the center console of the vehicle. \nThe trooper retrieved a glass bowl containing marijuana with a cork and a glass pipe. (GE \n12 at 1.) Applicant said that after he returned from the work assignment, another \nemployee admitted that the marijuana and drug paraphernalia belonged to him. (Tr. at \n95.)

In mitigation, he cites that the incident is over 16 years old and occurred \nduring a fifth-year anniversary celebration with his first wife where he and his wife were \nharassed by a group of 10 individuals. The group assaulted him, and he and his wife fled \nthe area in his car. They were chased by this same group and after the group departed, \nhe was picked up for driving under the influence. \nAt the hearing, he testified that his first spouse had been driving and wrecked the \nvehicle. He said that he had been prepared to fight the charges, but his lawyer suggested \nthat he just take the plea deal. (Tr. at 99.) He pled guilty to protect his wife from having to \ngo through the legal process. (Tr. at 99.) When asked by his counsel, \u201cWere you drinking \nand driving on April 2006?\u201d he stated \u201cNo, I was not.\u201d (Tr. at 111.) \nApplicant\u2019s wife told the police that Applicant was driving the vehicle because she \nwas not good with a manual transmission and that he had been attempting to get away \nfrom a group that was trying to fight him. She described Applicant as losing control of the \nvehicle at an intersection and striking a tree. Applicant told the responding police officer, \nthat he had been trying to get away from a group of males to protect his wife and himself \nand had lost control of the vehicle while attempting to evade the group of men. (GE 11 at \n4.) He explained to a police officer that he left the scene of the accident to call the police \nand that he had only consumed two twelve-ounce beers. (GE 11 at 4-5.) The police officer \nnoted the strong smell of alcohol from Applicant, that the vehicle\u2019s airbags had deployed, \nthat the driver\u2019s side airbag had blood on it, and that Applicant \u201cwas bleeding from his \nhead.\u201d (GE 11 at 4.)2 \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6  1.f and 2.a: March 1999, charged and convicted of DUI (under 21) \nand possession of marijuana, and required to pay a fine, attend counseling; and \nhad his license suspended for approximately 6 months.

He described the other \nincident as \u201c\u2026the MPs sneak attacked us in the middle of the night. And I was the only \nmilitary person there, military dependent there out of 12 people. And so I was arrested for \npossession of marijuana.

In his Answer Applicant admits the conduct and takes full \nresponsibility for his actions. (GE 1 at 30.) At the hearing he admitted to being arrested \nfor possessing a quarter pound of marijuana. He was charged with intent to distribute. He \nacknowledged his arrest in his 2008 SCA and in his 2008 subject interview. He admitted \nproviding marijuana to friends but denied dealing drugs. (Tr. at 126.) He described his \nresponse to his sentence as \u201cI did everything but complete it successfully.

And obviously, it didn't \nwork for me because I was again young and dumb\u201d referencing SOR \u00b6 1.i. (Tr. at 109.) \nI found Applicant's responses and demeanor at the hearing inconsistent with \nsomeone who was reliably telling the truth. Inconsistencies between his testimony, prior \npleas of guilty, statements to the police and background investigators. and other evidence \nin the record including witness accounts further undermined his credibility. \nApplicant offered the testimony of two work colleagues, as well as his father, a \nretired senior enlisted member of the U.S. Air Force. The witnesses were very credible. \nThey detailed their familiarity with Applicant and events in Applicant\u2019s life that had set him \nback. The witnesses understood the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct of Applicant. They expressed their confidence in \nApplicant\u2019s ability to maintain a security clearance. (Tr. at 26-29; 36-41; 48-57.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the\nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition,\nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern for criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 31are potentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(d) violation or revocation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a \ncourt-mandated rehabilitation program. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the record, the above \ndisqualifying conditions apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to, \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6 32(a) and (d) do not apply. Applicant has six drug-related offenses spanning \n19 years, 1994, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, and 2013. Over the past 18 years he has had \nthree DUI arrests, 1999, 2006, and 2017, with the most recent DUI in 2017 being \nunresolved by him, resulting in him being charged in 2021 for driving on a suspended \nlicense. Since 1994, Applicant has not gone more than seven years without a recurrence \nof criminal activity, with the most recent conviction in 2018. Applicant was released from \nprobation less than two years ago for the domestic assault conviction. Applicant\u2019s criminal \nhistory raises concerns about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness because of his \nactions and failure to either comply with or properly document his compliance with a court \norder. Applicant acknowledges his arrests and convictions but denies or minimizes the \nunderlying conduct despite pleading guilty. His testimony lacked credibility given the \ninconsistencies between his testimony and his prior statements; those of others; in \naddition to his guilty pleas. His conduct reveals an individual who repeatedly showed an \nunwillingness to comply with the law, rules, and regulations; who exercised poor \njudgment; and who has failed to accept responsibility for his actions. Applicant\u2019s conduct \ncontinues to cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. He has not \nexpressed remorse. It is difficult to find that he is successfully rehabilitated when he \nrefuses to accept responsibility for his actions. The criminal conduct security concerns \nare not fully mitigated. \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nand \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nApplicant was arrested for DUI in March 1999, April 2006, and February \n2017. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant has multiple DUI arrests and convictions. Although his last DUI arrest \nwas in 2017, he has not acknowledged his improper alcohol use. He minimized his 1999 \nconviction saying he only had a beer, which he did not finish and was only pulled over \nbecause of the early morning hour. He denies his 2006 incident despite his admissions \nto the police officer, physical evidence, and his guilty plea. He minimizes his 2017 DUI \nblaming his actions on unknowingly drinking liquor with a higher alcohol content such that \nhe did not recall any additional information about the night due to blacking out and waking \nup in jail. Applicant consistently downplayed or even denied his drinking and driving \nincidents and laid out a variety of situations he would continue to drink while denying he \nwould drive after drinking. I have limited confidence in his testimony that he has modified \nhis alcohol use and that his security concerning conduct is unlikely to recur.

In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. His supervisor, security \nmanager, and father each testified credibly, in particular, concerning Applicant\u2019s \nrehabilitation, changes he has made in his life, and the likelihood of reoccurrence. I have \nincorporated my comments under Guidelines J and G in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant's eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the criminal conduct and alcohol consumption security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1: Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.j \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2: Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.s, 1.t, 2.a through 2.d, and 3.a through 3.c. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.r, 1.u through 1.z, 2.e and 2.f. He failed to respond to SOR \u00b6 3.d and it will be considered a denial. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 40 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2007. He returned to college in 2013 and completed a master\u2019s degree in 2020. He married in 2007 and divorced in 2016. He has two children, ages 16 and 11, from the marriage. He remarried in 2018 and has no children from the marriage. He has a 22-year child from a previous relationship and an 8-year-old child from another previous relationship. Applicant was commissioned in the military in 2008 and served until his honorable discharge in 2015 in the rank of O-3. He had combat deployments in 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2014.

Applicant and two witnesses testified on his behalf. \nHe did not offer any exhibits. The record was held open until April 18, 2023, to permit \nApplicant an opportunity to provide any documents he wanted considered. He provided \nApplicant Exhibits (AE) A through C. There were no objections, and they were admitted \nin evidence, and the record closed. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on April \n13, 2023. \nProcedural Matters \nIn accordance with DOD Directive 5220.6, the Government moved to amend the \nSOR to render it in conformity with the evidence admitted. The record was held open to \nallow Applicant an opportunity to provide additional evidence. There was no objection to \nthe motion, and it was granted. (Tr. 147-153) The SOR amendments are included in \nHearing Exhibit II. The SOR was amended as follows: \n1.aa You failed to timely file, as required, Federal and state income tax returns for \ntax years 2015 through 2021. As of the date of this Amendment, the tax returns remain \nunfiled. \n3.e You falsified material facts on an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP), executed by you on September 5, 2018, in response to \u201cSection 26 \n- Financial Record Taxes \u2013 In the last seven (7) years Have you failed to file or pay \nFederal, state, or other taxes when required by law or ordinance? You answered \u201cNo\u201d to \nthis question, and thereby deliberately failed to disclose that you failed to file your Federal \nand state income tax returns from 2015 to 2018.1 \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.s, 1.t, 2.a through 2.d, and 3.a \nthrough 3.c. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.r, 1.u through 1.z, 2.e and 2.f. He failed to \nrespond to SOR \u00b6 3.d and it will be considered a denial. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is 40 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2007. He returned to \ncollege in 2013 and completed a master\u2019s degree in 2020. He married in 2007 and \ndivorced in 2016. He has two children, ages 16 and 11, from the marriage. He remarried \nin 2018 and has no children from the marriage. He has a 22-year child from a previous \nrelationship and an 8-year-old child from another previous relationship. Applicant was \ncommissioned in the military in 2008 and served until his honorable discharge in 2015 in \nthe rank of O-3. He had combat deployments in 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2014. He has a \n1 Applicant\u2019s 2018 tax year return was not due until April 2019.

Applicant had no significant periods of \nunemployment and has worked for federal contractors since his military discharge. (Tr. \n15, 21-31) \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his answer to the SOR, statements to a government \ninvestigator, testimony, credit reports, criminal records, and documents from the military \ncorroborate the SOR allegations. (GE 1-14) \nThe SOR alleges, in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e through 1.q, that Applicant has delinquent student \nloans. SOR \u00b6 1.r is a garnishment by the Department of Treasury on behalf of the \nDepartment of Education for his student loans. Applicant obtained these loans for his \nundergraduate education. He said they were deferred when he was deployed. He said he \nmade some payments but could not recall any specifics. He testified that because he is \na 100% disabled veteran, his delinquent student loans were discharged and resolved, \nand he was not required to repay them. He provided a document confirming they were \ndischarged. He testified he applied for the loans to be forgiven in approximately \nSeptember 2021 and received notification it was approved in January 2022. The student \nloans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e through 1.q are resolved in his favor. (Tr. 16, 31-36, 119-\n126; AE A) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($17,329) and 1.s ($11,030) are debts for delinquent child support \npayments. Applicant testified that he was paying his child support payments for his two \nchildren with his ex-wife through an automatic withdrawal from his paycheck. Applicant \nwas unaware that when he changed jobs in 2017, the automatic payment stopped. When \nhe became aware, he paid his child support through an electronic cash application directly \nto his ex-wife, and he did not receive payment credit by the state administering the child \nsupport. His ex-wife testified and confirmed that she received the cash payments. \nApplicant testified that he contacted the state in 2021 or 2022 and was given credit for \nthe arrearages on this account. When he accepted a new job, he set up automatic \npayments from his pay for child support that goes to the state and then it is sent to his ex-\nwife. He has resolved SOR \u00b6 1.b. (Tr. 36-44, 158-162) \nThe child support arrearage in SOR \u00b6 1.s is for his youngest child and happened \nunder the same circumstances. The same state manages this child support. Applicant \ntestified that when he changed jobs, he made payments through an electronic cash \napplication. He said that the mother is uncooperative in acknowledging she received the \npayments, and she refuses to turn in the required papers to the state to confirm Applicant \nmade the cash payments to her. Applicant testified that he would provide the cash \nreceipts to show he made the payments. He testified that he would also provide a \ndocument from the state, which would show any balance owed. He did not provide these \ndocuments. His March 2023 credit bureau report reflects a balance of $13,533 owed. This \ndebt is not resolved. (Tr. 44-46, 130-134; GE 14) \nThe SOR alleged in \u00b6 1.z ($7,179) that the Department of Treasury was garnishing \nhis wages on behalf of the government creditor for reimbursement for lost equipment \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhile he was serving in the military. It is unclear if the garnishment was completed. He \ntestified there was an investigation into the missing items, which were found, and he \nreceived a letter telling him the debts were resolved. His October 2018, October 2019, \nJanuary 2021, and August 2021 credit reports reflect the debt. It is not reported on his \nMarch 2023 credit report. He failed to provide a copy of the letter. Since his wages were \nbeing garnished, I have given Applicant the benefit of the doubt and SOR \u00b6 1.z is resolved \nin his favor. (Tr. 46-51, 53-55, 126-130; GE 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 14) \nApplicant testified that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($86), 1.u ($215), and 1.v \n($790) are all medical accounts that should have been paid by the VA because of his \ndisability. I am unable to make that determination based only on Applicant\u2019s testimony. \nApplicant did not provide any documents to show he disputed or resolved these debts. \n(Tr. 52-53) \nApplicant testified that he paid the cell phone account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.x \n($1,330). He did not provide documented proof. SOR \u00b6 1.t ($499) is a collection account \nfor a payday loan and SOR \u00b6 1.w is a delinquent credit card account ($576). No proof \nwas provided to show these debts have been paid. (Tr. 52, 134) \nDuring his hearing, Applicant was asked by the Government if he had filed his past \nincome tax returns. He testified that he did not file federal or state income tax returns \nsince 2015. He testified that for tax year 2015, he forgot to file his returns and then he \nkept telling himself he would file and each subsequent year he did not. He testified that \nhe received a notice from the IRS about his delinquent taxes, but he could not recall the \nyear. He said when he returned from deployment, he did not file his 2015 tax return, and \nhe was dealing with the death of his father in March 2016. Every year he would receive \nhis W-2 income tax form from his employer, and he knew he had to file his returns but did \nnot. He admitted he was neglectful and did not file his federal and state income tax returns \nfor tax years 2015 to the present. In his post-hearing submissions, Applicant did not \nprovide any documents to show he has filed any of the delinquent income tax returns. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.aa) (Tr. 144-151, 154) \nBased on Applicant\u2019s testimony that he was aware he had not filed his federal or \nstate income tax returns beginning in 2015, I find he deliberately failed to disclose this \ninformation as required on his SCA. He admitted at his hearing that he lied on his SCA \nwhen he failed to disclose that he had not filed his tax returns. (Tr. 146-147; GE 1) \nApplicant was apprehended by military police in August 2012 and suspected of \nassault consummated by a battery and spouse abuse after a mutual confrontation with \nhis then-wife. Applicant testified that there was mutual pushing and shoving between him \nand his then-wife. He was ordered to participate in counseling with the base chaplain. He \nand his then-wife participated together for a time and then she stopped. He then went by \nhimself. He estimated the entire counseling was for about six to seven months. There \nwas no disciplinary action.

He pleaded guilty to petit larceny and was sentenced to 12 months \nconfinement (11 months and 10 days were suspended) and ordered to pay court costs. \nApplicant testified he believed his then-wife was cheating on him. He went to the man\u2019s \nworkplace and called a number he retrieved from his then-wife\u2019s phone that belonged to \nthe man. When the man answered, it confirmed to Applicant that this was the man. When \nthe man was not looking, Applicant took his phone. He was later arrested. He received a \nletter of reprimand from his command. (SOR \u00b6 2.b) (Tr. 57-59, 84-93; GE 9) \nIn July 2016, while working overseas, Applicant was accused of sexual assault and \nabusive sexual contact on a foreign national. He denies the accusations. He was returned \nto the United States. An investigation ensued. Applicant was not arrested or charged. The \nU.S. Attorney declined to prosecute. However, his company learned through the \ninvestigation that alcohol was involved, and it was during the work week, so Applicant \nwas terminated. (SOR \u00b6 2.c) (Tr. 59-61, 93-98; GE 8) \nIn July 2017, Applicant was arrested for driving while intoxicated (DWI). He \nadmitted he was over the legal limit but could not recall the breathalyzer reading. He could \nnot recall how many drinks he had, but indicated it was a significant amount. Applicant \nwas represented by an attorney. In October 2017, he pleaded guilty to DWI and was \nsentenced to 30 days confinement (all suspended), 36 months of unsupervised probation, \nfined $250 and ordered to pay court costs of $349. His driver\u2019s license was suspended \nfor a year. (SOR \u00b6 2.d) (Tr. 61-64, 98-101; GE 10) \nApplicant was arrested in July 2017 for driving with a suspended license.

(GE 1) \nIn March 2019, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. He was \nasked why he failed to disclose his delinquent student loans, child support, and other \ndelinquent debts. Applicant said he did not know how his student loans were broken down \ninto different accounts. At the time he was interviewed, his loans had not yet been forgiven \nand were delinquent. He told the government investigator that after Hurricane Katrina \n(2005) his student loans were broken into smaller accounts. He was unaware the loans \nhad been reorganized until he received calls and notices from the creditors about the \naccounts. He did not have the information for each account, so he did not disclose them. \nHe said he was on a payment plan and was to pay $140 a month for nine months. The \ninvestigator gave him an opportunity to provide substantiating documents. He did not. \nPost-hearing, he provided emails from 2013 and 2015 to the creditor requesting his loans \nbe deferred because he was in the military. His email stated that his military obligation \nended in April 2020. He was discharged in 2015. His request was processed, and it \nappears the loans were deferred. However, he did not provide additional documents to \nreflect if he took any action on the loans after his discharge until the loans were forgiven \nin 2022.

He also explained that he disagreed with some of the debts, and he \nwas in the process of disputing and resolving them. He said that he interpreted the \nquestion incorrectly. (GE 13) \nI find Applicant was aware he had student loans that were delinquent and \ndeliberately failed to disclose them (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e through 1.q). I find that Applicant likely \ndid not deliberately fail to disclose his medical debts if he believed they should be paid by \nthe VA (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.u and 1.v). I also find that he did not deliberately fail to disclose \nhis delinquent child support because he believed he was paying it (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.s) \nbut not receiving credit. I also find he did not deliberately fail to disclose the remaining \ndebts that he thought were paid. My findings are limited to whether he deliberately failed \nto disclose these debts and not to whether he is responsible for paying them. (Tr. 78-79; \nGE 13) \nApplicant told the investigator that he attributed his financial problems to his child \nsupport obligations that were to be modified in April 2019.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income taxes as \nrequired.  \nApplicant has numerous delinquent consumer accounts, medical debts, child \nsupport, and a payday loan. He failed to timely file his 2015 through 2021 federal and \nstate income tax returns. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the \nabove disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s student loans were forgiven due to his VA disability. They are resolved \nin his favor. He resolved one child support arrearage allegation but failed to provide \ndocuments to substantiate the other has been resolved. He claims his medical debts \nshould be paid through the VA but did not provide evidence that he disputed or resolved \nthose allegations, despite telling the government investigator he would do so. He also has \nnot provided evidence that he has paid any of his other delinquent debts. He did not \nprovide evidence that he has filed his 2015 through 2021 federal or state income tax \nreturns or made any arrangements with the IRS. There is some evidence that he has \nparticipated in financial counseling, but it is insufficient to conclude his finances are under \ncontrol. AG \u00b6 20(c) has minimal application. His debt resolved through garnishment does \nnot constitute a good-faith effort to repay the delinquent account, even though I have \ngiven him credit that it is resolved. I consider that Applicant attributed his financial issues \nto his child support obligations that he intended to have resolved in April 2019. Although \nthis may have been beyond his control, he failed to provide evidence that he acted \nresponsibly in resolving his delinquent debts and tax issues. He failed to provide \ndocumentation to support any action he may have taken to dispute any debts. None of \nthe mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 31, and the following is \npotentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nIn August 2012, Applicant was apprehended by military police and informed he \nwas suspected of assault consummated by a battery. He admitted he and his then-wife \nwere involved in a mutual confrontation that involved pushing and shoving each other. No \ndisciplinary action was taken. In January 2013, Applicant was arrested for grand larceny, \na felony, for stealing a cell phone from a man who he believed was having an affair with \nhis then-wife. He was convicted of misdemeanor petit larceny and sentenced to 12 \nmonths confinement, of which 11 months and 10 days was suspended. In October 2016, \nApplicant was notified that he was accused of sexual assault/abusive sexual contact while \nin a foreign country. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s office declined to prosecute. In July 2017, he \nwas arrested and later convicted of DWI. He was sentenced to 30 days confinement, \nwhich was suspended. He also received 36 months of unsupervised probation and his \nlicense was suspended for a year. In March 2021, he was arrested and charged with \ndomestic violence third degree harassment after he had an altercation with his then-wife \nand his stepdaughter\u2019s boyfriend. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom criminal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nThere is insufficient evidence to conclude that in October 2016, Applicant \ncommitted sexual assault/abuse sexual conduct while overseas. I find in his favor for SOR \n\u00b6 2.c. I also find that the charge of driving on a suspended license was not prosecuted \nand find in Applicant\u2019s favor for SOR \u00b6 2.e. \nRegarding the other allegations, Applicant has a history of criminal conduct \nbeginning in 2012 through 2021. Although some of it may be attributed to his PTSD, his \nlarceny conviction, DWI conviction, and his arrest in 2021 for domestic violence reflect \nserious misconduct. I have considered his testimony that he took an anger management \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nclass, a substance abuse class, and is seeing a mental health professional. Considering \nhis pattern of misconduct and the nature of his criminal activity, I am not confident that \nfuture misconduct is unlikely to recur. His history of criminal conduct raises question about \nhis willingness to comply with the law and casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. There is insufficient evidence of rehabilitation at this time, other than \nhis last offense was in 2021. I find the above mitigating conditions do not apply to the \nremaining criminal conduct allegations. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility:  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information.  \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant deliberately failed to disclose on his SCA his delinquent student loans, \nany of his criminal arrests, charges or convictions, and his failure to file his federal and \nstate income tax returns for tax years 2015 to 2017. I did not find his explanations credible \nregarding these matters. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies. \nAs noted above, I found in Applicant\u2019s favor regarding his failure to disclose his \nchild support debt, medical debts, and other consumer debts he believed were paid and \nwere not disclosed. \nThe criminal conduct allegations were cross-alleged under the personal conduct \nguideline. I find they are sufficiently covered under the criminal conduct guideline and AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(d) do not apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable to the \ndisqualifying security concerns based on the facts: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant\u2019s deliberate failure to disclose any of his criminal conduct, his delinquent \nstudent loans, and his failure to file his tax returns is not a minor offense. He was offered \nan opportunity by the government investigator during his background interview to provide \ninformation about these matters and he did not. The security clearance process relies on \nthose seeking a clearance to be honest and forthcoming. Applicant failed to do so, which \ncasts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. The above mitigating \nconditions do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F, J, and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those Guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s military service and participation in combat operations. \nApplicant has not filed his federal o\n r state income tax returns from 2015 to 2021. He has \nnot provided evidence of action he may have taken to resolve his other delinquent debts.  \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has held that: \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline D - Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Sexual Behavior is set out in AG \n\u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 13. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n (c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress;  and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \nApplicant received sexual gratification when viewing pornography involving \nunderage girls. He also paid for sex on multiple occasions in Thailand and the United \nStates. His conduct was criminal, and represents a pattern of high-risk sexual behavior \nthat reflects a lack of discretion or judgment. It also creates a vulnerability to coercion. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 14 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct occurred seven years ago. His wife is aware of said conduct, \nwhich does not make him susceptible to coercion, exploitation, or duress. Applicant has \na favorable prognosis from a health care professional. Sexual Behavior is found for \nApplicant. \nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 31 contains five disqualifying conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying. Two conditions apply, as discussed below: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant arguably engaged in criminal conduct by inadvertently viewing child \npornography, and by paying women for sexual acts. This evidence raises security \nconcerns under these disqualifying conditions, thereby shifting the burden to Applicant \nto rebut, extenuate, or mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 32 contains two conditions that could mitigate criminal \nconduct security concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nSufficient time has passed since Applicant\u2019s bachelor party, his last act of \narguably criminal conduct, about seven years ago. A health care professional gives him \na favorable prognosis against recidivism of sexual misconduct. The evidence \nestablishes mitigation under either or both of the above conditions. Criminal Conduct is \nfound for Applicant. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the\nperson's personal, professional, or community standing. \n \nApplicant \nreceived \nsexual \ngratification \nby \ninadvertently \nviewing \nchild \npornography, and from paid sexual acts by women in both Thailand and the United \nStates, on several occasions. The evidence is sufficient to raise this disqualifying \ncondition. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 including: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, . \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \nApplicant\u2019s wife is aware of this conduct. As a result, he is not vulnerable to \nexploitation, manipulation, and duress. He has also produced evidence from a health \ncare professional of rehabilitation. He has abstained from receiving illegal sexual \ngratification since 2015. Personal Conduct is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines D, J and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is well respected at both his workplace and in his community.

Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the sexual behavior, \ncriminal conduct, and personal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

While on active duty in \nthe Marine Corps, he submitted the 2018 EQIP for the periodic reinvestigation of his \nclearance eligibility. During the ensuing background investigation, he was interviewed \nabout the same 14 delinquent credit-card and loan debts that were later alleged in the \nSOR, which he had disclosed in the 2018 EQIP. During the interview, he proffered a plan \nto resolve his delinquent debts by filing bankruptcy. In April 2019, the CAF favorably \nadjudicated his clearance eligibility continuing his access to classified information. He \nsubmitted the 2021 EQIP to upgrade his security clearance. (GE 8 at 3; Tr. at 10, 41-42, \n127) \nSOR Allegations \nThe SOR alleged 13 delinquent debts, including credit-card and loan accounts \ntotaling $71,099, and a mortgage loan foreclosure. Applicant had disclosed the alleged \ndebts and the foreclosure in the 2021 EQIP. In his Answer, he admitted all 14 allegations, \nwhich were also confirmed by his 2018 and 2019 credit bureau reports (CBRs). His 2021, \n2022, and 2023 CBRs confirmed all but one debt, SOR \u00b6 1.n. (GE 3-7) \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts arose between about 2016 and 2018, when his \nfinances became overextended due to a combination of factors, including extraordinary \nexpenses, unemployment, and his PTSD struggles. His finances were initially strained by \na $1,500 legal fee he paid to successfully defend a reckless driving charge. Concurrently, \na rental property he owned fell into disrepair due to \u201ca couple of sets of bad tenants.\u201d \nThese factors had a ripple effect because of his history of overspending with credit cards \nbetween about 2005 and 2015. He struggled to keep up with his monthly payment \nobligations, resulting in what he described as a juggling act where he missed credit-card \npayments to pay the legal fee, and then missed mortgage payments to make his credit-\ncard payments. Eventually, he defaulted on the debts and mortgage loan alleged in the \nSOR and four other credit cards, which were not alleged in the SOR because they were \nsolely in his wife\u2019s name. He accepted responsibility for paying the unalleged debts \nbecause he incurred them with his wife. (GE 1, 2, 8; Tr. at 27, 46-48, 51-58, 91-94, 107) \nBetween 2016 and 2018, Applicant consulted with two attorneys for advice about \nhis financial situation. They advised him to file bankruptcy and to stop making his monthly \ncredit-card payments. The payments he missed while contemplating whether to file \nfurther exacerbated his financial problems. Ultimately, he chose not to file because he \nconsidered bankruptcy as an \u201ceasy way\u201d out and did not want to \u201cjust walk away from \neverything.\u201d Instead, he intended to find a way to repay his debts within his available \nmeans. In early 2019, he cashed out his Marine Corps retirement account, from which he \nnetted about $20,000 after taxes. He applied those funds toward resolving the unalleged \ndebts, maintaining his household expenses while he was unemployed, and \u201cput[ing] out \na few . . . fires\u201d.

The home became a rental property when they moved to another \nstate in 2011. He had missed about six to ten months of mortgage payments when the \nlender initiated foreclosure proceedings. He was unable to sell the home because the \nmortgage loan balance exceeded its fair market value, which never recovered from a 40 \npercent loss suffered during the 2008 financial crisis. Despite his attempts to rehabilitate \nthe mortgage loan by making monthly payments of about $1,000 (which was $300 over \nthe original payment amount) for an unspecified period, the lender foreclosed on the \nhome in about October or November 2018. He did not owe a deficiency balance on the \nmortgage loan after the foreclosure. (GE 8 at 4, 12; Tr. at 51-57, 125-126) \nSeveral other specific factors contributed to Applicant\u2019s missed mortgage \npayments besides his generally overextended finances. He was unaware that his \nmortgage loan had been transferred to a new service provider, which resulted in his \nmonthly payment no longer being automatically debited from his account. By the time he \nlearned of the problem, he was unable to pay in full the past-due balance of about $2,000, \nand the new service provider refused to accept an alternative payment plan. At the same \ntime, the rental property required costly repairs. He paid unspecified costs to replace \ncarpets, a water heater, and \u201ca bunch of [other] stuff.\u201d Through the process of applying \nfor a personal loan to help pay for additional repairs, which he could not afford, Applicant \nand his wife were surprised to learn that they were unable to qualify due to an \nunacceptable debt-to-income ratio. (GE 8 at 4, 12; Tr. at 51-57) \nUntil that point, Applicant and his wife neither realized how overextended their \ncredit had become nor understood the consequences of overusing credit cards. He and \nhis wife \u201cboth had bad spending habits,\u201d not due to buying \u201cluxury items,\u201d but to failing to \n\u201cbudget properly,\u201d and using credit cards \u201cimproperly.\u201d Because he witnessed his wife \nopening and using credit cards for the perks, he followed suit. He and his wife also opened \nnew credit accounts to transfer balances. He was never educated on credit-card use. He \ngrew up in a very poor rural area. His father had a low paying job and his mother did not \nwork outside the home. He observed his father use credit cards to make ends meet. He \nstated, \u201cThis seemed normal to me, and I had no concept of a budget, or the pitfalls of \nover-extended credit card use.\u201d He added, \u201cI was just really financially illiterate, looking \nback on it.\u201d (GE 8 at 12; Tr. at 47-48, 50-57) \nFinancial Counseling \nApplicant has not had any formal financial counseling. He did not consider the \ninformation he received from the bankruptcy lawyers as such. However, he and his wife \nhave \u201cdone a lot of stuff together\u201d to try to educate themselves about better managing \ntheir finances. They opened an account with a credit bureau agency to help them \u201cclosely \nmonitor\u201d their credit. They read articles from that agency as well as other sources on how \nto improve their credit, which is what led them to opening credit cards for credit-rebuilding \npurposes. They \u201care both on the same page\u201d and \u201care communicating better\u201d about their \nfinances, which was not the case in the past.

They were saving about $300 per month and relying \nprimarily on cash to pay expenses. He categorized their financial situation as good and \nfinances healthy, which would afford him the ability to continue repaying his debts.

He estimated that his annual \nsalary and benefits totaled between about $70,000 and $90,000 when he retired from the \nMarine Corps in December 2018. His annual salary was $90,000 from September 2019 \nthrough March 2020, and was $110,000 from March 2020 until September 2020, when it \ndecreased to $105,000. Due to cost-of-living raises \u201cand such,\u201d his annual salary had \nincreased to $117,000 as of the hearing. Since February 2019, he has received additional \nannual income of about $50,400 for his U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs 100 percent \ndisability pay, and about $30,600 for his Marine Corps retirement pay. (Tr. at 38-41, 63) \nApplicant\u2019s wife has been employed throughout their marriage, primarily as a \ndental technician, but also in retail. However, she \u201chad to job-hop at lot\u201d due to Applicant\u2019s \nchanging duty stations. Her annual salary historically averaged between about $30,000 \nand $35,000. About a year and half prior to the hearing, she decided to switch careers to \npursue her passion of becoming a nurse and to increase her income. While waiting to \nbegin nursing school in the fall of 2023, she has been working as a substitute teacher, \nwhich reduced her annual salary to about $20,000.

He later learned that he incurred \nthe taxes because he failed to properly adjust his withholdings. He received a $4,500 \nfederal income tax refund in May 2023, after properly adjusting his withholdings in tax \nyear 2022. He used $1,000 of his 2022 tax refund to pay his current credit-card accounts, \n$2,000 toward the remaining balance of a $2,700 new couch he previously purchased, \nand then saved about $1,500. He intended to apply the $1,500 toward repaying his \ndelinquent debts. He considered replacing a \u201cvery, very old\u201d couch to be a necessity and \nnot an extravagant expense.

During the 2021 Interview, he anticipated \nthat he could fully resolve all debts by 2026 by first paying the smaller debts (which he \ndefined as anything under $3,200) within two to three years, and then the larger debts \nwithin five years.

He next planned to pay the credit-card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.a. ($2,245), which he considered \u201cmost pressing\u201d since it was in \u201cactual collection and \nnot a charge-off.\u201d Then, he planned to negotiate a monthly repayment plan to resolve the \ntwo debts with the same creditor (the bank he used his \u201centire adult life\u201d), SOR \u00b6 1.b \n($16,504) and the fourth unalleged debt ($6,500).

As of the hearing, he could not afford to pay more than the $150 \nhe had been paying towards the second unalleged debt. However, he anticipated that, as \nhe continues to pay down his debts, and his and his wife\u2019s income increases, he would \nbe able to incrementally increase the amount he pays monthly toward his debts. He was \nclose to paying off a credit card on which he has been paying $200 monthly. Once that \n$200 is freed up, he planned to use it to make monthly payments toward another debt. \nHe believed that if he continued this approach, it would \u201csnowball\u201d over time and afford \nhim the ability to pay more and more hundreds of dollars each month toward fully \nresolving all his delinquent debts.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan at 531). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d \nis \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington Metro. Area \nTransit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a nexus or \nrational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and \nan applicant\u2019s security suitability. (ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2016)). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd.

May 1, 2012)) \nThe record evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions set forth in AG \u00b6 19 under this guideline: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(e) consistent spending beyond one's means or frivolous or irresponsible \nspending, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, a history of late payments or of non-payment, or other \nnegative financial indicators. \nI considered each of the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the concern \nunder this guideline and find the following warrant discussion: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred  \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAdjudication of security clearance eligibility involves evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness, and is not a debt-collection proceeding. The \nAGs do not require an applicant to immediately resolve or pay each debt alleged in the \nSOR, or to be debt free; nor is there a requirement that the debts alleged in an SOR be \nresolved first. An applicant need only establish a plan to resolve the indebtedness and \nthen take significant actions to implement the plan. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has actively worked to address his indebtedness since 2016. He made \npayments to rehabilitate his delinquent mortgage loan before its foreclosure. He consulted \nwith two bankruptcy attorneys. He sought out resources to improve his financial literacy. \nHe established a reasonable debt repayment plan and has taken significant actions to \nimplement the plan within his available means. He paid one unalleged debt in July 2018, \nand another in April 2020. He made consistent monthly payments between May 2019 and \nJune 2023 to resolve another unalleged debt. He paid the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a \nwithin a reasonable period of the timeframe he promised at the hearing. In total, he has \npaid $23,865 toward resolving his delinquent debts. \nApplicant\u2019s testimony was sincere and credible. His understanding about finances \nand budgeting has evolved. He lives within his means and manages his current finances \nresponsibly. He demonstrated a good-faith effort to address delinquent debts that he \nincurred under circumstances not likely to recur. He has made meaningful progress in \nrepaying his delinquent debts over an extended period. He may not have presented a \nperfect case in mitigation, but perfection is not the standard. The decisions he made to \nprioritize paying other debts or expenses were neither unreasonable considering his \ncircumstances nor motivated by a willful violation of his obligation to repay the SOR debts. \nHis track record of payments and responsible actions lead me to conclude that he will \nfollow through with his plan to fully resolve the remaining SOR debts. I have no lingering \ndoubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(d) \nare established to mitigate the Guideline F concerns alleged in the SOR. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered his two combat deployments, \nservice-related mental health struggles, and his persistent efforts to resolve his delinquent \ndebts. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant \nhas mitigated the security concerns raised by the debts alleged in the SOR.

Eligibility for security \nclearance access is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 12, 2016, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to retain a security clearance required for a position \nwith a defense contractor. On May 4 and May 16, 2017, he provided personal subject \ninterviews (PSIs) to an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). \nThe Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated \nAdjudications Services (CAS) could not make the affirmative findings required to \ncontinue a security clearance, and issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), \ndated December 7, 2021, detailing security concerns raised by personal conduct \n(Guideline E) and financial considerations (Guideline F).

The lack of an \nanswer to SOR \u00b6 2.a is interpreted as an admission based on Applicant\u2019s affirmative \nanswers under SOR \u00b6 1. He admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.g, and denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c, 2.d, \n2.e, and 2.f, without explanations. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice for a \nhearing on January 13, 2023.

(Tr. 26) As financial manager \nbetween 2010 and his termination in October 2013, Applicant embezzled approximately \n$100,000 by writing checks to himself for three or four years. He did not have to do \nmuch to conceal his activity because oversight was lacking. The largest check that he \nwrote during the period was $1,500.

(Answer to SOR; GE 5 at 1-12; GE 7 at 9; Tr. \n27, 31-32, 72-73) \nAs financial manager, Applicant was charged with reconciliation of all school \naccounts. He had access to the school credit cards and school checks. In the fall of \n2009, his first wife quit her job and moved out of their apartment at about the same time \nhis first child was born. Unable to pay the lease himself, he moved out of the apartment \nbefore the end of the lease, resulting in his wages being garnished by the landlord for \nthe balance of the lease. With access to the school checks and credit cards, Applicant \nbegan misappropriating the school\u2019s money for personal use. He initially purchased \nnecessary items for his children like clothes, or his home like rent and utilities. Then he \nwrote checks for his family and friends who were experiencing financial problems. \nInitially estimating he embezzled no more than $80,000, he eventually lost track of the \namount of money he pilfered from school credit cards or checks. (GE 5 at 2, 10; GE 7 at \n10-11; Tr. 27-30, 72) \nIn addition to writing checks for his family and his house, Applicant wrote a \ncheck to cover expenses for his own college classes. To reduce his debt after his \nwages were garnished in the fall 2009, he wrote additional checks, promising himself \nthat he would stop when his financial problems abated and when the school switched \nfrom one bank to another. He anticipated repaying the school at an unidentified future \ndate. (GE 5 at 2, 9-10; GE 7 at 11) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c \u2013 In response to Section 13A of his December 2016 e-QIP, \nApplicant was asked whether in the last seven years he had been fired, or quit his job \nafter being told he would be fired, or left by mutual agreement following charges of \nmisconduct, or left by mutual agreement following notice of unsatisfactory performance. \nHe answered \u201cno\u201d stating that he \u201cleft to further pursue education.\u201d He deliberately did \nnot disclose his SOR \u00b6 1.a conduct. Applicant\u2019s claim that he was in school at the time, \nis not supported by his e-QIP or witness C, a co-worker at the school. See GE 1 at 11, \n17-18; Tr. 112-125. Applicant falsified the December 2016 e-QIP because he did not \nwant to lose his employment and the potential earnings that awaited him if his security \nclearance application was approved. (Answer to SOR; Tr. 35, 38) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d \u2013 in response to Section 26 of his December 2016 e-QIP, Applicant \nwas asked if he had been counseled, warned, or disciplined for violating the terms of a \ntravel or credit card in the last seven years. By answering \u201cno\u201d (GE 1 at 33), he \ndeliberately failed to reveal the SOR \u00b6 1.a conduct. He lied because he feared that he \nwould not receive a security clearance. (Answer to SOR; Tr. 85) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b \u2013 During a May 2017 personal subject interview (PSI) with an OPM \ninvestigator, Applicant indicated that he never told his first wife of the SOR \u00b6 1.a \nconduct because she would use it against him.

(Answer to SOR; GE 7 \nat 11; Tr. 35, 38) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e - During the May 2017 interview with the OPM investigator, \nApplicant failed to disclose his SOR \u00b6 1.a conduct. Instead, he claimed that he had no \nhistory of employment issues in the previous seven years. Applicant did not reveal the \nembezzlement until the OPM investigator confronted him about the misconduct. \n(Answer to SOR; GE 7 at 8, 9-12; Tr. 87-88) \nApplicant testified that he had completed many e-QIPs since his December \n2016 e-QIP and May 2017 PSIs, and truthfully disclosed all the circumstances of his \nOctober 2013 employment termination. He believes his positive accomplishments have \nresulted from adverse past events and he feels no need to conceal those events \nanymore. Applicant was unable to produce the e-QIPs because he could not access the \ne-QIP web site since he did not have an active investigation. No additional information \nwas provided. (GE 5 at 1; Tr. 40, 88-89) \nFinancial Considerations \nSOR \u00b6 2.a \u2013 The SOR also cross-alleges SOR \u00b6 1.a in SOR \u00b6 2.a. Applicant \ndid not answer this allegation. However, I find against him based on his admission to \nthe embezzlement under SOR \u00b6 1.a. Applicant testified that he would like to make a \ndonation to the special needs school. In 2020, he spoke to one of the school directors \nduring a COVID-related funeral of a mutual friend and apologized for his misconduct. \nThe director told Applicant that more severe discipline was not imposed against him \nbecause the director wanted him to turn his life around. Applicant has not returned any \nof the funds to the special needs school. During the first week of January 2023, \nApplicant provided an update to the director on how circumstances have positively \nchanged in his life. (Tr. 54-57, 76) \nSOR \u00b6 2.b \u2013 In Applicant\u2019s May 2017 PSI (GE 7), an OPM investigator \ninterviewed him about child support arrears and other delinquent accounts set forth in \nSOR \u00b6 2. He indicated in the first two pages of the exhibit that he agreed with \ninformation he provided to the OPM investigator and adopted the investigator\u2019s \nsummary as an accurate reflection of the interviews. On January 22, 2018, Applicant\u2019s \naffirmation of the May 2017 PSI was notarized. (GE 7 at 1-3) \nApplicant admitted that his child support for his two sons was in arrears. He \nindicated that his interim clearance had been withdrawn in 2018 because he did not \nrespond to an SOR that he never received. Unemployment for six months during the \nyear triggered the child support arrears. Applicant\u2019s documentation reflects that his \narrears on December 20, 2022 were reduced to $9,549. (AE C) His current child \nsupport payments are automatically taken from his paycheck. The present support order \nrequires $976 a month in current support payments and $240 a month for arrears. \nApplicant is regularly involved in his son\u2019s weekly activities. He willingly provides \nmonetary assistance to his two sons above the child support requirements.

In Applicant\u2019s May 2017 PSI (GE 7), he discussed a car \naccount (no account number listed) with the OPM investigator. He stated that he leased \na car that was repossessed in 2014 by a car company after he lost his job at the special \nneeds school in September 2013. Applicant indicated that the $6,000 he estimated that \nhe owed was somehow resolved or eliminated when, in his view, he voluntarily turned \nthe car back into the dealer in March 2014. The last five lines of the paragraph are \nambiguously worded. Later in the PSI, the investigator interviewed Applicant about the \nearlier repossession. Applicant agreed with the earlier discussion about the \nrepossession. However, the investigator quoted an account number that did not appear \nin the earlier discussion of the repossession. He also identified a different car than the \none discussed earlier in the PSI. (GE 7 at 13, 15) \nIn his testimony, Applicant explained that he had no idea what the SOR \u00b6 2.c \naccount represented. After claiming that he disputed the account with the help of a \ndispute letter provided by an online dispute application, the account was removed by \ntwo of the three credit agencies. (Tr. 45-46) However, the account still appears in the \nGovernment\u2019s and Applicant\u2019s December 2022 credit reports. (GE 9 at 5; AE D at 5) \nApplicant claimed that he returned the car and paid the amount owed on the lease \nbecause he did exceed the amount of mileage allowed. His testimony that he returned \nthe car and paid the mileage fee implies that he acknowledges the car account. What is \nmissing is documentary support for his claim of paying the balance due on the leased \ncar. Notwithstanding the discrepancies in the May 2017 PSI, I find that Applicant leased \na car that he returned to the dealer in March 2014. His claim of paying off the balance of \ndebt is not corroborated. The debt is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d, 2.e, and 2.f \u2013 The Government\u2019s June 2019 credit bureau report \nshows that the last payment activity on three federal credit union accounts is between \nFebruary and May 2014. The account numbers for the three accounts are crossed out. \n(GE 4 at 2) Under each entry in the report is the notation that Applicant disputed the \nthree credit union accounts. (GE 4 at 2) \nThe OPM investigator interviewed Applicant in May 2017 about delinquent \ncredit union accounts, including those listed at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d, 2.e, and 2.f. Applicant \ninformed the investigator that that he owed about $9,000 for a credit union credit card. \nHe began paying on the charged off debt in April 2017. No account number is posted in \nApplicant\u2019s account of the credit union credit card. (GE 7 at 13) Two pages later, the \nPSI posts account numbers and debt amounts. (GE 7 at 15) Applicant agreed with the \nthree accounts. He stated some credit union accounts were duplicates. He mentioned \nthat he was in a payment plan to pay off the accounts in five years. On the next page, \nApplicant stated that the credit union debts, the child support, and the repossession \ntroubles arose as a result of the embezzlement.

He did not recall the payment plan or the debts belonging to \nhim. He disputed them and claimed that he provided evidence to the credit agency that \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d, 2.e, and 2.f did not belong to him, and they were removed by the three \nagencies by 2021. (GE 2 at 5; GE 4 at 2; GE 7 at 13, 15; GE 9 at 5; Tr. 49, 92-97) \nBecause of the age of the three debts, it is likely that the debts were removed by the \nexpiration of the statute of limitations, not because the accounts did not belong to him. I \ndo not find his testimony credible. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d, 2.e, and 2.f have not been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 2.g \u2013 Applicant admitted owing the Department of Education (DOEd) \n$222 for a student loan that was opened while he was enrolled in school in 2010 to \n2012. The loan is delinquent. He has not repaid the loan because the Federal \nGovernment placed repayment of student loans on hold due to the COVID pandemic. \nThe hold is still in effect. Applicant will repay the loan when advised by the Government \nor his school. (Tr. 50-51) The account is resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nApplicant does not intend to lie to the Government in the future. He has a keen \nunderstanding of what trustworthiness signifies. He perceives himself as someone who \nis rehabilitated based on the necessary adjustments he has made in his life. (Tr. 58-60) \nCharacter Evidence \nWitness B, a contractor for the Government, is Applicant\u2019s first cousin. He \nreceived his security clearance in 2007. He complimented Applicant as a good husband \nand father, who demonstrates a solid job performance. Witness B views the three-year \nperiod of embezzlement as a mistake or error in judgment that Applicant will not repeat \nbecause he has matured. (Tr. 106-109) \nWitness C is currently the regional program director at the school that \nterminated Applicant in October 2013. Even though Applicant committed the \nembezzlement, witness C still believes that Applicant is trustworthy. In the last ten \nyears, Applicant has matured and is rebuilding his life. He resumed employment. He \nremarried. He is responsibly raising his children. (Tr. 112-125) Witness C generated a \ncharacter statement (AE L) explaining that Applicant demonstrated remorse for \ncommitting the embezzlement. With the passage of time, Applicant remarried, and his \nwife had a baby. He purchased a home. Applicant has matured by learning from his \npast mistakes. (AE L) \nWitness D, a personal trainer, has known Applicant since childhood. He \nconsiders Applicant an honest and helpful friend. Applicant\u2019s embezzlement and \nfalsification does not negatively affect witness D\u2019s opinion of Applicant as a trustworthy \nfriend who is headed in the right direction. Witness D opined that Applicant\u2019s \nembezzlement was caused by not knowing what to do at the time. He has grown since \nthen and divorcing his first wife helped that growth.

Her \nrespect for him increased because he could have waited to tell her or not tell her at all. \nSince 2013, Applicant has focused his attention on accomplishing goals like getting \nmarried, purchasing a house and becoming certified in his profession. His wife believes \nshe and Applicant are financially stable and current on all financial obligations. Applicant \ndid not seek her advice on how to answer Section 26 of his December 2016 e-QIP.

He received two additional certificates as an agilest and a scrum master. \n(AE H) \nReference J wrote a three-page character reference that she has known \nApplicant since 2006 when they both worked at the special needs school where the \nembezzlement occurred. Reference J admired Applicant\u2019s dedication in the different \njobs he held at the school.

Staff members regularly referred to Applicant for advice on complex \ntechnical issues and financial methodology. (AE M) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n7 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility: \nAG \u00b6 16. Conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts \nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing \nor omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofession involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that he may not properly \nsafeguard classified or sensitive information;  \n8 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. This includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of \nclient \nconfidentiality, \nrelease \nof \nproprietary \ninformation, \nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or government \nprotected information \u2026 \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress by a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. \nSuch conduct includes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, \ncould affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community \nstanding. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a - Between the fall of 2009 and the end of September 2013, \nApplicant was the manager of finance, responsible for reconciliation of all accounts at \nthe special needs school. He was in charge of all school checks and school credit \ncards. He admitted that he began writing school checks to himself. Initially, he \npurchased necessary items for his children, or his house, or his education. Then, he \npurchased items that he wanted but did not necessarily need. After misusing a credit \ncard for personal items in August 2013, he was terminated in October 2013 for \nembezzlement. Applicant\u2019s three to four-year period of embezzlement and misuse of a \nschool credit card establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), 16(d)(3), and 16(d)(4). The relevance of AG \n\u00b6 16(e) is reduced by Applicant\u2019s divorce from his first wife in 2014. \nSOR \u00b6 (1.c) - Applicant admitted that he deliberately falsified Section 13A of his \nDecember 2016 e-QIP when he did not disclose that in October 2013, he was \nterminated from employment at the special needs school.

SOR \u00b6 1.e \u2013 During the same interview described above, \nApplicant deliberately concealed material facts by denying he had any employment \nissues in the previous seven years. AG \u00b6 16(b) applies. \n \nAG \u00b6 17. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate the \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \nAfter considering the foregoing conditions that could mitigate Applicant\u2019s \npersonal conduct, AG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply because Applicant did not correct \nthe concealment until confronted by the embezzlement. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not \napply because his deliberate falsifications of his security clearance application in \n2016 and the 2017 PSI are serious offenses and demonstrate his lack of \nreliability and judgment. \nApplicant receives some mitigation under AG \u00b6 17(d) for the positive \nadjustments he has made in his life recently. After finally admitting the \nembezzlement in May 2017, Applicant remarried in 2021 and is raising a young \nbaby born at the end of 2022. He has restored his child support to a current \nstatus. However, he has not provided any restitution to the special needs school. \nIn sum, the limited mitigation Applicant receives under AG \u00b6 17(d) is insufficient \nto find in his favor under the personal conduct guideline. \nThough Applicant\u2019s current child support obligation indicates that he still \nhas to interact with his former wife, his divorce in 2014 reduced his vulnerability \nto exploitation.

AG \u00b6 17(e) applies. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of \nincome is also a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal \nactivity, including espionage. \nAG \u00b6 19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;   \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, \nfiling deceptive loan statements and other intentional financial breaches \nof trust.  \nA person\u2019s practice of paying his voluntarily incurred debts is a private matter \nuntil evidence reveals that he is not paying his debts in a timely fashion. Adverse \nevidence from credit reports can usually meet the Government\u2019s obligation of proving \ndelinquent debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02403 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015); \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply \nbecause Applicant has provided no evidence to support his claims that he paid the SOR \n\u00b6 2(c) debt, and that the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2(d), 2(e), and 2(f) debts do not belong to him. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(b) and 19(d) apply to SOR \u00b6 2(a) because Applicant embezzled a large amount of \nmoney over a lengthy period of time and has not provided restitution even though he \nhas had ample opportunities since 2013. Applicant\u2019s documentation shows that he has \nrestored currency to his child support.

Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \nAG \u00b6 20 (a) is not available for mitigation because only two of the eight debts \nhave been resolved. Though the embezzlement and misuse of the school\u2019s credit card \nended more than nine years ago, the conduct was neither isolated nor resolved. \nApplicant\u2019s concealment of the conduct in 2016 and 2017 continues to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability and judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. Applicant\u2019s loss of employment in September 2013 \noccurred because of his decision in the fall of 2009 to take money from the school for a \nthree or four-year-period. Embezzling money from an employer is not da legitimate \nmethod of solving financial problems. By not resolving the \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), 2(d), 2(e), and \n2(f) debts, Applicant has not acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply as there is no evidence that Applicant has had \nfinancial counseling, and there is no documentation that indicates the delinquent debts \nare being resolved or under control. \nApplicant has not furnished sufficient evidence to show that he is making a \ngood-faith effort to repay most of his creditors. Assuming that he is relying on a \nlimitations statute making the SOR debts no longer enforceable, his reliance is \nmisplaced. The DOHA Appeal Board has repeatedly held that in security clearance \ndecisions, the Government is entitled to evaluate the surrounding facts and \ncircumstances of applicant\u2019s conduct, regardless of whether the \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), 2(d), 2(e), \n12 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand 2(f) debts are considered unenforceable due to the running of the applicable statute \nof limitations. See ISCR Case No. 11-07-09966 at 2-3 (App. Bd. June 25, 2008); See \nISCR Case No. 15-02326 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 14, 2016). Relying on the statute of \nlimitations does not constitute a good-faith effort to eliminate financial debts. See ISCR \nCase No. 15-01208 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2016). Accordingly, AG \u00b6 20(d) does not \napply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the specific guidelines in the context of the \nnine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant is 35 years old and has provided favorable evidence that he is a \nresponsible husband and a good father. His character evidence indicates that he is well \nrespected by similarly situated co-workers in his professional field.

(GE 1) Between December 2016 and June 2019, he worked \nfor other employers as a maintenance technician. (GEs 1-2) He has held a security \nclearance since April 2004. (GE 1; Tr. 28) \nApplicant\u2019s finances \nBetween 2018 and 2021, Applicant accumulated delinquent student loans \nexceeding $93,000. (GEs 1-3; Tr. 23-30) He accrued these student loan deficiencies \nduring recurrent periods of unemployment when he could not work. Applicant\u2019s student \nloan records document that his loans were in forbearance throughout the 2017 calendar \nyear and early 2018. (Tr. 34) Once the forbearance was lifted in 2019, he was not \nfinancially able to address them. As a parent of an autistic child (their youngest), \nApplicant\u2019s wife could not work outside of the home. (Tr. 27) Compounding his financial \ndifficulties in 2019, Applicant injured his foot (causing a stress fracture) and could not \nwork for at least six months. (GE 3; Tr. 34) While unable to address his student loans \nfor lack of monetary resources, Applicant\u2019s student loans were placed in collection \nstatus by the DoE. (Tr. 34) During his time away from work, he was treated for \npulmonary issues. (GE 1 and AEs Q-R and X-Y) \nOnce Applicant returned to full-time employment in 2019, he made contact with \nhis student loan lender and entered the lender\u2019s rehabilitation program. Applicant \nsuccessfully completed his rehabilitation program. Records document that in May 2021, \nApplicant\u2019s rehabilitated student loans were returned to his servicing agent in December \n2020 for administering and collection if necessary. (GE 2 and AE A Tr. 37) By White \nHouse Executive Order, Applicant\u2019s still outstanding student loans were placed in \ndeferment status in December 2021, and are tentatively scheduled to be returned to \nactive enforcement status October 2023. (Tr. 37) At this time, all but $38,763 of his \naccrued delinquent student loans have been forgiven and discharged. (AE D; Tr. 37-38) \nIn December 2021, Applicant contracted COVID-19 and did not return to work \nuntil March 2022. (Tr. 24-25) For most of his COVID-19 absences, he received short-\nterm disability payments while being treated for his COVID symptoms. Records \ndocument that Applicant was approved for short-term disability and missed over three \nmonths of work. (AEs Q-R and X-Y; Tr. 24-26) Because his treating physician declined \nto provide more medical information about his condition, he was denied any further \nfinancial assistance. (Tr. 24-26) \nWith his job promotion and salary increase (from $26 to $33 an hour), Applicant \nfully expects to be able to meet his student loan demands once the payment pause is \nexpectedly lifted in October 2023. (Tr. 29, 38, 43-44) Since his recovery from COVID-\n19, he has returned to full time employment. (AEs F-N; Tr. 25) His remaining student \nloans are currently in good standing. While he has personal loans to repay (two from \nfinancial institutions exceeding $16,000) along with advances from his brother and \nfriends exceeding $1,400. (Tr. 47-48) He remains confident that he will be able to fulfill \nthese personal obligations and still meet the $143 set monthly payments on his student \nloan debts when the pause is lifted.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \n4 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. .  .  .

This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. \n2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s reported over Applicant\u2019s \naccumulated delinquent student loans following their emergence from forbearance in \n2018.These debt delinquencies warrant the application of two of the disqualifying \nconditions (DC) of the financial consideration guidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to \nsatisfy debts\u201d; and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Each of these \nDCs apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nApplicant\u2019s cited work-losses and family stresses affected his ability to address \nhis student loans before they were placed in delinquent status, all of which played a \nmajor role in his accrual of his student loan delinquencies. While some of his loans were \nforgiven, others were rehabilitated and returned to current status before they were \npaused during the COVID 19 pandemic. These latter debts exceed $38,000 and will \nbecome due and enforceable once the pause is lifted as expected in October 2023. \nConsidering all of the circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s added financial burdens \nassociated with his job loss and medical issues, mitigating condition MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency \na death, divorce or separation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or \nidentity theft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d is \napplicable to Applicant\u2019s to situation. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n                                \n \n \n                  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nthe voluntary payment of accrued debts.

In addition to the \nfacts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of relevant fact. \nApplicant is a 42-year-old long haul truck driver employed by a defense contractor. \nHe has worked for his current employer since November 2020. He and his wife, who is \nhis driving partner, have been married since July 2017. They currently live in State A after \nrelocating in 2016 from State B, where Applicant grew up.

(GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 31 \u2013 33, 35) \nApplicant was underage when he was arrested for DUI in either 1999 or 2000. He \nhad been at a party with friends and claims to have had little to drink. He was stopped at \na police checkpoint on the way home and administered a breathalyzer test. It showed he \nhad alcohol in his system, albeit far less than the legal limit for intoxicated driving; \nhowever, because he was under 21 years old, he was charged with DUI. The court fined \nhim, required him to complete an alcohol safety and awareness program (ASAP), and \nplaced him on probation for one year. (Answer; Tr. 39 \u2013 41) \nAs alleged in SOR 1.b, on June 9, 2003, Applicant was charged with being under \nthe influence of a controlled substance. Aside from an entry in the FBI report admitted as \nGX 3, little else is known about what the substance was or under what circumstances he \ncame to be charged. Nor is there any information about the disposition of the charge. In \nhis personal subject interview (PSI) with a government investigator in December 2020, \nhe denied the arrest. In response to the SOR, he admitted the allegation; however, based \non his testimony, it appeared that he was unclear about what he was admitting. At \nhearing, he testified he does not specifically recall such an incident, but allowed that he \n\u201cwas probably under the influence at the time of one of [his other arrests].\u201d (Answer; GX \n2; GX 3; Tr. 41 \u2013 45) \nOne night in December 2003, Applicant was stranded without a way home and \nfound an unlocked car in which he spent the night. The next morning, he saw someone \nleave a different car running unattended and stole it. As he was driving away, he crashed \ninto a telephone pole and left the scene, only to be apprehended a short time later. He \nwas convicted of vehicle theft and hit and run, for which he was sentenced to 36 months \nin jail, but served only about three months and spent the rest of his sentence on probation. \n(Answer; GX 2; GX 3; GX 8; Tr. 45 \u2013 47) \nIn August 2005, Applicant was arrested for having vehicle registration tabs from \nanother car. He had stolen them a few months earlier and put them on his own car. He \ndid so because he could not afford to renew his vehicle registration. He subsequently was \ncharged with felony receipt of stolen property and forging or altering a vehicle registration. \nHe was convicted of receipt of stolen property and sentenced to 120 days in jail. On March \n2, 2006, after his incarceration, he was placed on another 36 months of probation \nbecause he had violated his earlier probation from his December 2003 arrest. (Answer; \nGX 2; GX 3; GX 5; Tr. 48 \u2013 49) \nIn March 2006, Applicant began a live-in relationship with a woman (S) he met \nafter he was released from jail. The couple lived in a recreational vehicle (RV) on property \nowned by C. At some point, S also developed a romantic relationship with V, someone \nknown for his violent behavior. S and V started taking money from C\u2019s bank account. \nUnbeknownst to Applicant, S and V then conspired to kill C to cover up their crimes \nagainst C. Applicant saw S and V stab C to death outside the RV on C\u2019s property. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant feared V, who threatened Applicant with death if he did not also stab C even \nthough he was dead. V also forced Applicant to bury the body, and threatened to kill \nApplicant if he told anyone what had happened. The police eventually became aware that \nC was missing. After locating the body, Applicant, S, and V were arrested and charged \nwith murder. Applicant was incarcerated for six years awaiting trial. In 2012, he was \nacquitted in a separate jury trial, and he testified against S and V, both of whom were \nconvicted and are currently serving life sentences. (Answer; GX 2; GX 3; Tr. 49 \u2013 63) \nIn May 2016, Applicant stole an electronic device from a department store. He was \nstopped by the store\u2019s security personnel and returned the item. He then fled the scene \nin his car, but store security recorded his license plate, and he was promptly arrested. \nThereafter, while awaiting prosecution for a shoplifting charge, he and his wife moved to \ntheir current state of residence. In December 2016, in State A, Applicant and his wife \nwere arrested and charged with trespassing, burglary of an unoccupied dwelling, and \nlarceny. Around one a.m. on December 20, 2016, Applicant and his wife were together \nwhen, over her objections, he stole a tire from a dumpster on the property of an auto parts \nstore to replace one of the tires on his car that had failed. It appears that this arrest and \nhis May 2016 shoplifting charge were resolved together by a court in State A. In April \n2019, he agreed to a plea deal whereby, he was given 36 months of probation, which he \ncompleted in April 2022.

They \nsubsequently found food and shelter a nearby Christian ministry. They stayed on to \nvolunteer to help other homeless persons and have been active in that ministry ever since. \nApplicant credits the ministry with helping him get back on his feet and get started in the \ntrucking industry. Two other members of that organization testified that Applicant is now \nreformed and committed to the ministry\u2019s cause, which he and his wife espouse when \nthey are on the road for long stretches. The witnesses recommended Applicant for a \nposition of trust based on their assessments of him as reliable and honest. (Tr. 34, 36 \u2013 \n38, 77 \u2013 86, 97 \u2013 105) \nFor his part, Applicant blames his long history of misconduct on being young and \nstupid. A friend from high school, who has known Applicant for over 25 years, testified for \nApplicant and believes him to be reliable and someone who follows the rules. He, too, \nremarked on conduct Applicant engaged in when he was younger and believes that he \nnow is more mature. Applicant\u2019s wife testified that she has seen growth in Applicant since \nthey met, but she acknowledged that someone over 30 years old should not use \u201cyoung \nand dumb\u201d as an excuse for the decisions they make. (Tr. 87 \u2013 96, 105 \u2013 126) \nApplicant\u2019s employer states that he is a reliable employee. His sister and stepfather \nalso support Applicant\u2019s request for a clearance, stating that he is hardworking, reliable, \nand has learned from his mistakes.

(See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 \n(1988)) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(Egan at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nCriminal Conduct \nAvailable information shows that Applicant has engaged in criminal conduct on \nnumerous occasions between 1999 and 2016. As to SOR 1.b, the record contains only \nan entry of a charge in June 2003 of being under the influence of a controlled substance. \nDuring his PSI, Applicant denied the charge. Although he admitted the SOR allegation, \nthere is no other information about that event other than Applicant\u2019s assumption that he \nprobably was under the influence of marijuana at some point around that time. SOR 1.b \nis resolved for Applicant. \nAs to SOR 1.e, available information shows that, at a minimum, Applicant was an \naccessory after the fact to C\u2019s murder by helping to bury the body and by failing to call \nthe police. However, he was acquitted at trial of a murder charge, and it appears his \nactions after C was murdered resulted from a legitimate fear of bodily harm at the hands \nof V. He did not willingly engage in that criminal conduct, and SOR 1.e is resolved for \nApplicant. Nonetheless, the Government\u2019s information is sufficient to support the \nremaining SOR allegations. That information reasonably raises the security concern \nabout criminal conduct stated at AG \u00b6 30: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nMore specifically, this record requires application of the following AG \u00b6 31 \ndisqualifying conditions: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n(d) violation or revocation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a \ncourt-mandated rehabilitation program.  \nAG \u00b6 31(a) applies because, when taken as a whole, Applicant\u2019s long history of \ncriminal conduct significantly undermines confidence in his judgment and reliability. As \nalready discussed, there is insufficient information to show he engaged in the criminal \nconduct discussed in SOR 1.b and 1.e. AG \u00b6 32(b) does not apply to SOR 1.b and 1.e; \nhowever, it does apply to the remaining allegations. AG 30(d) applies because Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \ncommitted the offenses described in SOR 1.g while on probation for the offenses \ndescribed at SOR 1.f. \nI also have considered the following pertinent AG \u00b6 32 mitigating conditions: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(b) and 32(c) are applicable only to SOR 1.b and 1.e. Applicant was \ncoerced into his participation in C\u2019s murder in March 2006, and there is insufficient \ninformation to support the charge of being under the influence of a controlled substance \nin June 2003. Otherwise, the record shows he knowingly and willfully engaged in the \nconduct alleged. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) do not apply. While it has been about seven years since \nApplicant\u2019s last arrest, he violated probation by committing his most recent offense. As to \nSOR 1.g, he decided to steal the tire over the objections of his wife, who also was arrested \nfor that offense. By contrast, the record also shows Applicant is active in the community \nthrough his ministry, he has completed training as a truck driver and has a good \nemployment record. Nonetheless, he has a long record of criminal conduct that began as \na teenager and ended in his mid-thirties. He has only recently completed the terms of his \nprobation because of the added time from a probation violation.  \nThe security concerns raised by the Government\u2019s information are not mitigated. I \nalso have considered the potential application of the whole-person factors at \u00b6 2(d). \nApplicant\u2019s witnesses and written character witnesses showed that he has greatly \nchanged and that he is on the right track. Applicant has characterized the underlying \ncause of his misconduct as being young and stupid; however, his two most recent \noffenses occurred while he was in his mid-thirties. I am also mindful that he only recently \nemerged from probationary status. When balanced against his long record of misconduct, \nit is too soon at this time to conclude his criminal conduct will not recur. As a result, doubts \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \nremain about his suitability for a security clearance. Because protection of the national \ninterest is the paramount concern in these adjudications, such doubts must be resolved \nagainst the granting of access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.b and 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, 1.g: Against Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information. Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance is denied. \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

She has no real \nestate or business assets in Iran, apart from the personal property discussed infra. (Tr. \n40-41; AE N) She has a valid driver\u2019s license. (AE H) \nForeign Influence \nThe sole allegation under this concern alleges that Applicant has personal \nproperty in Iran valued at approximately $600,000. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) The Government \nbecame aware of these holdings when she self-reported them in her October 6, 2019, \nSF-86, and in her March 3, 2020, Office of Personnel Management interview. In her SF-\n86, she reported acquiring these holdings in October 1974. (GE 1, GE2) In her SOR \nAnswer, Applicant admitted this allegation with clarification. Her reported foreign \nfinancial interests are her share of personal property assets that she and her sister \ninherited directly from their maternal grandparents when they passed away. Applicant \nand her sister received an equal interest in the inheritance. The personal property held \nin Iran consists of hand-crafted silver and glass objects and original paintings \n(heirlooms) that have been in the family a \u201c[h]undred and eighty years or so\u201d and are \nstored at a secure \u201cvault-like\u201d commercial storage facility in Iran. (SOR Answer; Tr. 35-\n36, 52-55, 65, GE 1, GE 2; AE C) Post-hearing, Applicant\u2019s counsel submitted \nexplanatory family photos with some of the artwork in storage highlighted in red. (AE \nBB) \nApplicant and her sister intend to keep these heirlooms in storage with the hope \nthat in the future relations between the United States and Iran will improve and they will \nbe able to bring these heirlooms to the United States legally. The current Iranian export \nrestrictions did not exist until the Iranian revolution. (Tr. 36-37) Having been born in Iran, \nApplicant maintains her Iranian passport because she would not be allowed to enter \nIran with a U.S. passport. Furthermore, it would be difficult if not impossible for \nApplicant to dispose of or sell any of the heirlooms unless she has an Iranian passport. \nApplicant is willing to give up her Iranian passport when this issue is resolved. (Tr. 37-\n38, 40) \nIranian customs prohibit the export of antiques and original artwork, which is the \nreason that Applicant\u2019s family was unable to export any of those items at the time they \nimmigrated to the United States. Hence, she opted to place them in a storage facility in \nthe hopes that Iran would ease their export regulations in the future. Additionally, as a \nU.S. citizen, and because Iran is presently a sanctioned country, Applicant is prohibited \nfrom engaging in any business dealings to sell or send proceeds back to the United \nStates without an OFAC license. Based on Applicant\u2019s research, it appears that OFAC \ngrants permission to U.S. persons to sell inherited real or personal properties in Iran. \n(SOR Answer; AE C, AE D) \nHowever, Applicant stated since there is no direct banking relationship between \nthe United States and Iran, bringing the sale proceeds to the United States still remains \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncomplex and risky. It is well known that the foreign exchange houses in Iran charge a \npremium on top of the exchange rate to transfer funds through a third country to the \nUnited States. These exchange houses make no guarantees whether the funds will \narrive safely in the United States as the intermediary banks can also block the funds \nbased on their own governing rules and regulations beyond OFAC. (SOR Answer; Tr. \n38-39; GE 2; AE C) \nApplicant pays the storage facility annual cash payments of 120 Iranian Rial \n(IRR) in-person on behalf of her sister and herself. When Applicant paid the 120 IRR \ntwo years ago, this amount equated to $11 under the then current exchange rate. The \n$600,000 valuation was done in 1978, forty plus years ago when Applicant\u2019s \ngrandparents passed away. The collection has not been appraised since then. Applicant \nconcedes that it is generally true that art and antiques maintain or appreciate value over \ntime. However, the Iranian currency has dramatically lost its value since the 1979 \nrevolution. As a reference, at the time of the revolution one U.S. dollar was being \nexchanged for around 70 IRR and today it is being exchanged for around 280,000 IRR, \nabout 4,000 times reduction in value. Given this severe depreciation of the Iranian Rial, \nit is very likely that today\u2019s reappraised value of the collection, in U.S. dollars, would be \nmuch less than the original appraised value. In short, Applicant stated, \u201c[s]o I honestly \ncannot say is it a greater value, lower value, where it is. It\u2019s just I don\u2019t know.\u201d (SOR \nAnswer; Tr. 51-52, 56, 58-59, 63-64) Post-hearing, Applicant\u2019s counsel submitted a brief \nhistory of the exchange rate in Iran, and articles that discussed the substantial \ndevaluation of the IRR from 1980 to 2016 and from 2018 to 2022. (AE CC, AE DD, AE \nEE) \nBecause Applicant does not intend to sell the heirlooms, she has not had a more \nrecent appraisal. If the assets were forcibly seized, the loss of the assets would not \nplace Applicant in a position for influence or coercion because of her income, real estate \nholdings, and continuing employment in the United States. The heirlooms have great \nsentimental significance, and it is Applicant\u2019s intent to maintain control of them. It \nsymbolizes her Persian cultural heritage, and she would very much prefer to eventually \nhave the heirlooms displayed in her own home in the United States. She has opted to \npreserve and store the heirlooms in Iran in the hopes of being able to legally export \nthem from Iran. It was and remains her mother\u2019s wish that Applicant and her sister have \nthese family heirlooms. (SOR Answer; Tr. 40) Applicant has not given any thought to \nthe disposition of the heirlooms in Iran should the import restrictions still be in effect \nafter she and her sister pass away. (Tr. 55-56) If the Iranian regime should change in \nthe future, Applicant has no intention of ever moving back to Iran. Her whole career, life, \nfamily, and friends are in the United States. She stated, \u201cI have no reason to go back.\u201d \n(Tr. 56-57) \nApplicant assured that if for any unforeseen reason, her heirlooms were forcefully \nseized by the Iranian government she will forego her financial interests. The financial \nloss of the heirlooms would not place her in any possible position for influence or \ncoercion. She has a strong sense of ethics, earns a substantial income, owns the \nproperty she lives in, personally manages her mother\u2019s three rental investment \nproperties valued at \u201cclose to $3 million,\u201d and owns a stock investment portfolio valued \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nat a much greater value then the assets in question.

Covid restrictions were in place and Applicant and \nher mother did not visit anyone. During this visit, Applicant paid the storage facility \nwhere her family heirlooms are being stored their fee in IRR cash. She typically pays \nher storage fees \u201cfor multiple years\u201d at a time. When making storage fee payments, she \ntries to give herself a cushion because of the yearly inflation rate, which recently was at \n\u201c46, 47 percent.\u201d (Tr. 43-50) She visited Iran in 2021 to renew her Iranian passport, \nwhich she must do every five years. As of her hearing date, she had no immediate visits \nto Iran planned. The frequency of her visits to Iran have varied. For example, the year \nher father died she visited Iran three times. And there have been periods of time where \nshe has not visited Iran for two or three years. (Tr. 48, 50-51) \nDuring her hearing, Applicant stated that her Iranian passport was stored in a \nbank safe deposit box. She stated that if required she would surrender her Iranian \npassport to her facility security officer (FSO). (Tr. 65-66, 68-71) Post-hearing, \nApplicant\u2019s counsel submitted an Industrial Security Letter dated January 15, 2019. In \nsummary, that letter stated that cleared contractors who have retained a cleared \nemployee\u2019s foreign passport, based on DoD directions or personnel security \nadjudicative decisions, should immediately return the foreign passport, or identity card \nto the cleared employee. Upon return the foreign passport to the cleared employee, the \nFSO will remind the cleared employee of their responsibility to enter and exit the United \nStates using their U.S. passport. The cleared contractor would submit an incident report \nif any cleared employees report uses of a foreign passport to enter or exit the United \nStates. (AE AA) \nApplicant submitted a notarized statement of intent dated July 12, 2022, in which \nshe stated that she would never use her Iranian passport for any other reason other \nthan to maintain the safety of family heirlooms, that she has in her possession a valid \nIranian passport, that the only reason she has an Iranian passport is to secure and \nmaintain the safety of her family heirlooms, and that she will not use her Iranian \npassport for any other purpose except to maintain the safety of her family heirlooms. \nWhen not in use, she will secure her Iranian passport in her safe deposit box. She will \nnotify her FSO of the date she removes her Iranian passport from her safe deposit box \nand of the date she returns it to the safe deposit box. Lastly, her FSO informed her that \nhe will no longer take custody of foreign passports of employees. (AE X, AE Z) \nExcept for Applicant\u2019s immediate family residing in the United States, no one is \naware of this heirlooms collection. Even the managers of the commercial storage facility \nin Iran are not fully aware of the contents in the storage container. This property is \nunlike real estate or a bank account, which would be registered under her name and \neasily traced back to her.

He has held clearances since \n1988 at various levels and currently holds a top secret clearance. Before beginning his \ncareer as a defense contractor, he previously served as a nuclear trained submariner \nfor 14 years. (Tr. 18-20) \nVP also submitted a reference letter on behalf of the Applicant in which he \nstated: \nI interviewed, hired, and managed [Applicant] at [defense contractor] and \nduring that time I initiated the process to get her approved for a SECRET \nclearance. . .. In my time spent with [Applicant] I believe she cares deeply \nfor this country and realizes the deep impact the work we do everyday has \non maintaining our freedoms and the American way of life. . .. Today you \nhave the ability to make a difference in that equation by granting a security \nclearance and allowing a great mind to do important technical and \nscientific work that matters.  \nVP testified that he is familiar with the SOR allegation against Applicant and \nstated that he does not have any concerns about her being granted a security clearance \nbased on his first-hand knowledge of her character. VP added that Applicant will be able \nto contribute to the national defense, and that she will resolve any conflict in favor of the \nUnited States. (Tr. 21-25; AE E) \nApplicant submitted two additional letters: (1) from the director of business \ndevelopment of a defense contractor; and (2) the chief executive officer of a cable \ncompany. Both individuals know Applicant well from their interactions with her while \nemployed with previous employers. They described her as having \u201cunparalleled \nintegrity,\u201d \u201cwork ethic beyond reproach,\u201d and said she was a \u201cdedicated, hard-working, \nand highly ethical employee.\u201d All three references have extensive security clearance \nexperience and strongly recommend that Applicant be granted a clearance. (AE E) \nApplicant\u2019s 2020 annual work performance evaluation further corroborates the \ncomments made in the reference letters. (AE F) Lastly, Applicant submitted photos of \nher relaxing with friends and family in a non-work setting. (AE G) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines \n(AG), which became effective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and  \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest.  \nThe behavior of the Iranian government presents a serious national security \nconcern. The heightened-risk element is easily satisfied. Given Applicant\u2019s ties to Iran \nvia her collection of inherited valuable family heirlooms stored in Iran, the Government \nestablished its case under Guideline B. The above disqualifying conditions are \nestablished by the evidence. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position or having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property\ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not\nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \n \nIran\u2019s relationship with the United States, and the heightened risk it presents, \nplace a heavy burden on Applicant to mitigate the security concern. With that said, \nApplicant has multiple indicators of being a mature, stable, responsible, and trustworthy \nperson. She cooperated fully throughout the security clearance process. I found her \ntestimony to be credible. \nI have considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Iran via her collection of \ninherited valuable family heirlooms stored in Iran. She inherited these family heirlooms \nfrom her maternal grandmother in 1974. At that time, they were reportedly worth \n$600,000. This estimate is over 40 years old and does not consider the significant \ninflation the Iranian Real has sustained throughout the years especially since worldwide \nsanctions were instituted against Iran. At some point before she immigrated to the \nUnited States in 1990, she or someone in her family arranged to have these heirlooms \npacked and transported to a secure storage facility in Iran where they remain to this \nday. Iran does not permit the export of such items and the heirlooms will remain in \nstorage until such time as export restrictions are relaxed. Since the heirlooms were \nplaced in the storage facility, Applicant has ensured that the storage facility receives \ntheir storage fees in cash in IRR and in person. As Applicant explained, she sometimes \npays more than a year at a time and extra to account for inflation and the fact that she \nmay not be able to visit Iran every year. \nApplicant\u2019s multiple visits to Iran using her Iranian passport in the last five years, \nincluding after she received the SOR, cause some concern. When she is in Iran, she is \navailable for coercion. Similarly, when her mother went to Iran, she was available for \ncoercion. I acknowledge that in ISCR Case No. 08-02864 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2009) the \nAppeal Board said AG \u00b6 8(b) could not be used to mitigate security concerns caused by \nan immediate family member\u2019s visit to Iran because of the serious risks of coercion of \nthe visitor to Iran. However, this Applicant\u2019s connections to the United States are so \ncompelling I am convinced she could not be coerced into compromising national \nsecurity. \nSince arriving in the United States at age 18 in 1990, Applicant has embraced \nthe American way of life by pursuing her university and graduate education. Since \ncompleting \nher \neducation, \nshe \nhas \namassed \na \nnumber \nof \nprofessional \naccomplishments.

She is also heavily vested in the United States by \nembracing and participating in all the rights and privileges of being a U.S. citizen. All of \nher immediate living family members are in the United States and are U.S. citizens. \nThese factors serve in stark contrast to her comparatively limited connections to \nIran. She has no immediate family member there with whom she has close contact. She \nhas no personal or real property other than the inherited heirlooms. Those cannot be \nsold or exported, so she cannot do anything with them other than maintain custody of \nthem in Iran. The value of those heirlooms remains uncertain. Rather, the heirlooms in \nIran have more of a sentimental value than a monetary value to Applicant, particularly in \ntheir present state. Given the fact Applicant\u2019s self-reported heirlooms in Iran have raised \na security concern, she understands and is sensitive to the nature of the security \nconcern based on foreign influence. Although her ties to Iran still count and cannot be \ndismissed out of hand, the strength of those ties are diminished given the facts and \ncircumstances here. On balance, her ties to the United States are far stronger than any \nties she may have to her heirlooms in Iran. \nGiven the totality of the facts and circumstances, I conclude that it is unlikely \nApplicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of the \nUnited States and the Iranian governments or her family heirlooms. I further conclude \nthere is no conflict of interest because Applicant has developed such deep and long-\nstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States that she can be expected to \nresolve any potential conflict of interest in the favor of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(a) is \npartially applicable. AG \u00b6 8(b) is fully applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). The discussion in the Analysis \nsection under Guideline B is incorporated in this whole-person section. However, further \ncomments are warranted. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant finds herself in a situation placed upon her through family ties. To \nsummarize, she self-reported the fact that she inherited a purported $600,000 worth of \nheirlooms in Iran by inheritance. This estimate was made over 40 years ago when the \nIRR was much stronger. Although the current value of these heirlooms is unknown, it is \nunlikely that they are worth anything near that 40-year-old valuation. Since then, she has \nbeen responsible for the safe keeping of these heirlooms. At some point before she \npermanently immigrated to the United States, arrangements were made for the safe \nstorage of these heirlooms in a secure storeroom in Iran. She is required to pay the \nstorage fees in cash in IRR, which she has faithfully done and will continue to do until \nthe Iranian government eases their export restrictions. \nIn 1990, at age 18, Applicant along with her sister and parents left Iran to make a \nnew life for themselves in United States. Life in Iran post-Shah was incompatible with \ntheir political views. It is noteworthy that they waited over 12 years for their visas to enter \nthe United States, which they did legally. After arriving in the United States, Applicant \nexcelled academically and professionally as discussed in further detail supra. She earns \na respectable six-figure annual salary, owns a home valued at $1.618 million, with an \nequity of about $800,000 and has significant other assets indicative of financial security. \nGiven Applicant\u2019s substantial U.S. assets, it is unlikely that her heirlooms in Iran could \nserve as a financial incentive to gain leverage against her. She maintains close contact \nwith her immediate family in the United States who like herself are all naturalized U.S. \ncitizens. In contrast, she has no real or personal property in Iran, apart from the family \nheirlooms, which she cannot remove from Iran in the current political climate. Nor does \nshe have any relatives in Iran with whom she maintains close contact with. In short, for \nthe last 30 years her personal and professional lives have been in the United States. \nIt is worth noting the strong support she has from several of her professional \ncolleagues. All of those individuals have extensive experience as security clearance \nholders and have no reservations in recommending that she be granted a security \nclearance. In summary, they noted, among other things, her attributes of integrity, \nhonesty, and loyalty to the United States. In addition to these attributes, she brings a \nhighly specialized skillset to the table in support of the defense industry. \nFollowing the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988), and the clearly consistent standard, I have no doubts or concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I have weighed the \nevidence as a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the \nunfavorable evidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. The \nwhole-person concept independently supports her access to classified information. \nAccordingly, I conclude that Applicant met her ultimate burden or persuasion to show \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

(Applicant Exhibit G.) \nMitigation \nApplicant submitted a letter from his supervisor, who is the general counsel of the \ndefense contractor. She has worked daily with Applicant for five years, since he began as \nan intern. She stated, \u201cI have personally found [Applicant] to be honest, trustworthy, \nreliable, dedicated and loyal.\u201d The rest of the letter is also laudatory. She recommends \nApplicant for a position of trust, which is shown by the company\u2019s decision to propose \nApplicant as the Facility Security Officer. (Applicant Exhibit D at 1-2.) \nApplicant submitted his annual appraisal covering his first full year working for the \ndefense contractor. His supervisor stated, \u201c[Applicant\u2019s] performance in 2020 was \nexcellent.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit C at 5-10.) \nApplicant submitted letters from a long-time friend and from his fianc\u00e9e. They each \ndiscuss Applicant\u2019s stated and unequivocal intention not to use marijuana. (Applicant \nExhibit D at 3-4.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe security concern relating to Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse is set \nforth in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted \nin this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nI have examined the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 and especially \nconsidered the following: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition). \nApplicant used marijuana on an occasional basis from 2012 to 2020. The stated \ndisqualifying condition applies. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 have also been considered: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug-involvement and substance\nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nIn my analysis, I have taken administrative notice of the Security Executive Agent \n(SecEA) \u201cClarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Individuals Eligible to Access \nClassified Information or Eligible to Hold a Sensitive Position,\u201d dated December 21, 2021. \n(Applicant Exhibit E.) In her Guidance, the SecEA noted the increased number of states \nthat have legalized or decriminalized the use of marijuana and issued Applicant Exhibit E \nto \u201cprovide clarifying guidance.\u201d She reaffirmed SecEA\u2019s 2014 memorandum regarding \nthe importance of compliance with Federal law on the illegality of the use of marijuana by \nholders of security clearances. She provided further clarification of Federal marijuana \npolicy writing that this policy remains relevant to security clearance adjudications \u201cbut [is] \nnot determinative.\u201d She noted that the adjudicative guidelines provided various \nopportunities for a clearance applicant to mitigate security concerns raised by his or her \npast use of marijuana. \nShe further stated: \nAdditionally, in light of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting \nillegal drug use while occupying a sensitive position or holding security \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclearance, agencies are encouraged to advise prospective national security \nworkforce employees that they should refrain from any future marijuana use \nupon initiation of the national security vetting process, which commences \nonce the individual signs the certification contained in the Standard Form \n86 (SF-86), Questionnaire for National Security Positions. \nApplicant used marijuana for about eight years, ending in August 2020, about four \nmonths before he submitted the e-QIP. Applicant has a good job, has abstained from \nmarijuana use for over a year and a half as of the time the record closed, and evinced a \ncredible intent not to use it in the future. Applicant has submitted a signed statement of \nintent and has discontinued association with other drug users. Viewed in the context of \nthe whole person, Applicant has mitigated the security significance of his past drug use. \nParagraph 1 is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a young man just \nbeginning his career. His occasional of marijuana is in the past and, as stated, he evinces \na credible intent not to use marijuana in the future. The overwhelmingly positive \nstatements of his supervisor, the corporate general counsel, are particularly worthwhile \nas being from someone with serious legal responsibilities and an obligation to provide \nappropriate legal advice to her superiors in corporate governance, including about \nemployment. Applicant has mitigated his drug use. Overall, the record evidence does not \ncreate doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national security eligibility and a \nsecurity clearance. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance.

On March 22, 2021, he provided an interview (PSI) with an \ninvestigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudication Services \n(CAS) could not make the affirmative findings required to continue a security clearance, \nand issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated October 13, 2021, \ndetailing security concerns raised by financial considerations (Guideline F).

Though \nApplicant\u2019s documentation shows the account was paid, the funds to pay the account \ndid not clear the bank until April 8, 2023, the day after the hearing. As noted in \nStatement of Case, AE G, which is missing from Applicant\u2019s exhibit list, was not \nsubmitted into evidence and has been replaced by AE L to confirm the debt was settled. \n(Tr. 23-26; AE L) This account is resolved. \nSOR 1.b \u2013 This payday loan became delinquent in December 2019. Applicant \nclaimed that he settled the account in October 2022. He stated that he would submit \ndocumentation to confirm the settlement. No supporting documentation was submitted. \n(GE 2 at 4; GE 3 at 4; Tr. 26, 38) This account is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c \u2013 This retail account became delinquent in July 2019.

SOR \u00b6 1.d \nrepresents a past-due credit-card account. SOR \u00b6 1.e is an overdue personal loan. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f is a delinquent vehicle loan. The last payment on the accounts was in \nOctober 2015. In his October 2021 answer to the SOR, Applicant claimed that he had \nstarted a repayment plan with the creditor. At the April 2023 hearing, Applicant claimed \nhe no longer owed the debts to the credit union because after seven years, they \ndisappeared from his credit report. (GE 3 at 3; GE 4 at 3; Tr. 28, 38; AE A) The three \ndebts are unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g - This cell phone account became delinquent in March 2020. In his \nOctober 2021 answer, he claimed that he started communications with the creditor to \nresolve the account. Applicant\u2019s documentation to show that he disputed the account is \nan entry in his credit report indicating he disputed the account. However, he never \nstated the basis for his dispute.

In his October 2021 answer, he indicated he was talking to the collection agency \nto resolve the account. Applicant testified that he no longer owes the account because it \nwas removed from his credit report. (GE 4 at 4; Tr. 30, 39; AE A) The account is \nunresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i \u2013 This account is for a personal loan that became delinquent in April \n2019. In his March 2021 PSI, he planned to pay the account with his 2021 tax refund. In \nhis October 2021 answer to the SOR, he indicated that in March 2021, he disputed the \naccount through a credit repair firm.

The account became \ndelinquent in October 2019. In a letter dated April 20, 2022, the creditor informed \nApplicant that he had a zero balance on the account. (GE 3 at 5; GE 4 at 5; Tr. 32, 40; \nAE D) The account is resolved. \nSOR 1.k \u2013 This is a credit-card account that Applicant fell behind on when he \nwas unemployed. The account became delinquent in April 2019. In his October 2021 \nanswer to the SOR, he claimed that he began a repayment plan. In November 2021, the \ncollection agency notified Applicant that the account was satisfied and had a zero \nbalance. (GE 3 at 4; Tr. 32, 42; AE F) This account is resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.l \u2013 This is a medical account that became delinquent in July 2018. The \ncollection agency notified Applicant on April 20, 2022 that the account was paid-in-full. \n(GE 3 at 5; Tr. 32; AE E) The account is resolved. Applicant has paid or settled SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a, 1.c, 1.j, 1.k, and 1.l. totaling $1,609; he still owes SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, \nand 1.i, totaling $36,189. \nApplicant indicated he takes home about $3,000 a month in earnings after \ntaxes, and receives a $735 disability check from Veterans Affairs (VA) a month. From \nthe $3,735 a month, he has approximately $1,000 in discretionary funds every month \nafter he pays his expenses. Though he intends to contribute $500 a month of the \n$1,000 to his girlfriend\u2019s debt, he just began helping his girlfriend in April 2023, because \nhe was paying $700 in child support a month to his former wife as a part of the 2021 \nstipulated judgment. (Tr. 46-52; AE C at 3) \nApplicant intends to begin paying the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) $300 a \nmonth in April 2023 for delinquent income taxes for federal tax year 2019. There is no \nindication in the record that the payment was made in April 2023. On April 21, 2023, he \nowed the IRS $1,438. (Tr. 55; AE M) \nApplicant produced a copy of his budget for October 2022. (AE J) The budget is \nconfusing and several monetary entries in the budget are unidentified and do not \nsufficiently match the information he provided at the hearing. On page 1 of the three-\npage exhibit, the budget shows that he pays half a month\u2019s rent on October 1, (2022) \nwith his disability payment, leaving a $56 remainder. He received no income on October \n1 or October 5. The second page of the budget reflects that on October 19, 2022, \nApplicant was paid $1,540 and listed his monthly bills as $433 for his car, $230 for (car) \ninsurance (the same amounts he testified to at the hearing), a highlighted payment of \n$593.92 for the credit union debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f), and $100 for groceries. (At \nthe hearing, he testified his groceries were $400 a month.) On the left side of the \nsecond page, Applicant listed six unidentified monetary amounts, and the same credit \nunion payment identified earlier in this paragraph. (Applicant provided no proof of \n4 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npayments to the credit union at any time.) One other unidentified amount, $300, listed \non the left side of page 2, apparently represents his monthly payment to the IRS. \nHowever, according to Applicant\u2019s testimony, the IRS payments were not supposed to \nbegin until April 2023. After payment of all bills, his monthly remainder is $183, much \nless than the remainder he testified to at the hearing. The third page of Applicant\u2019s \nbudget shows the delinquent balances of the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f accounts. (Tr. 49-\n56; AE J) \nApplicant testified that because he knows that he owes the credit union for \nthe three debts, he intends to establish a payment plan with them by redirecting his \nmonthly remainder of $1,000 and the $700 judgment toward the three delinquent debts. \nIn his post-hearing submissions, he submitted no evidence to show that he took any \naction to resolve these three credit union accounts listed at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f. He \npresented no evidence of previous payments under a plan that he referred to in his \nOctober 2021 answer to the SOR. He presented no evidence of his disputes of the SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h accounts. (Tr. 54-55) \nApplicant testified that he participated in a financial counseling course in \nFebruary 2021 from the human relations (HR) office of his present employer. He stated \nthat he did not have the supporting documentation to confirm that he took the course. \n(Tr. 57) In his post-hearing exhibit list, Applicant listed three financial counseling \ncourses that he took on February 12, February 13, and February 18, 2023. Applicant \npresented no additional information about what he learned from the courses or what he \nincorporated into the management of his finances. (Post-hearing exhibit list, one page \nafter AE I and before AE J) \nIn the future, Applicant intends to stay abreast of his financial obligations, \nincluding his education payments, because he wants to be financially responsible. (Tr. \n58-59) \nCharacter Evidence \nWitness A has been Applicant\u2019s supervisor since he began working in late \n2020. Applicant\u2019s job is to remove, repair, and reinstall equipment on aircraft carriers. \nWitness A has written two performance evaluations finding Applicant\u2019s work to be \nsatisfactory with no complaints. Witness A knows about Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts, \nbut has not talked with him about those debts. He does not know how Applicant plans to \nfix his troubles.

Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of \nincome is also a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal \nactivity, including espionage. \nAG \u00b6 19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nA person\u2019s practice of paying his voluntarily incurred debts is a private matter \nuntil evidence reveals that he is not paying his debts in a timely fashion. Timing is also a \ncritical issue in debt-payment when the evidence indicates that an applicant does not \nbegin to resolve his financial problems until after he has been notified that his security \nclearance is in jeopardy. ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. September 26, 2019); \nISCR Case No. 16-03122 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 17, 2018) \nAdverse evidence from credit reports can usually meet the Government\u2019s \nobligation of proving delinquent debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02403 at 3 (App. \n6 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBd. Aug. 18, 2015); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) The \nGovernment credit reports establish that the debts listed in the SOR, totaling $37,701, \nbecame delinquent between 2016 and June 2021. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nAG \u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20 (a) does not apply since Applicant still owes over $36,000 in \ndelinquent debt to seven creditors or collection agencies. He incurred the debts \nbetween October 2015 and June 2021. Even though several delinquent debts may have \nbeen removed from his credit report, that removal does not mean that the debts have \nbeen satisfactorily resolved. ISCR Case No. 16-02941 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 12, 2017) \nApplicant did not provide persuasive evidence for me to confidently conclude that his \nfinancial problems will not persist or reappear. \nSince October 2015, Applicant has been unemployed about five times with his \nperiods of joblessness lasting for up to six months. The mitigating value of his periodic \nunemployment is reduced measurably by the fact that on two occasions during the \nperiod, he caused his unemployment by conduct within his control. Applicant\u2019s two \ndivorces have also been considered as a condition beyond his control. \n7 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn order for Applicant to receive full mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b), he must \nshow that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. Weighing against Applicant\u2019s \noccasional unemployment is his uninterrupted employment since January 2019, \ncorresponding with the parallel period of time that he has known about the delinquent \ndebts, but has failed to take appropriate action to resolve them. Applicant receives only \nlimited mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b). \n \nApplicant claimed he took a financial counseling course in February 2021. That \nclaim has very little probative value because it is uncorroborated. In his post-hearing \nsubmission, Applicant listed three financial counseling courses. That information has no \nprobative because it is unsubstantiated. Applicant\u2019s confusing testimony about how he \nintends to resolve the unpaid debts does not provide clear indications that his debts are \nbeing resolved or are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. AG \u00b6 20(d) has only \nlimited application to Applicant\u2019s satisfaction of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.j, 1.k, and 1.l \naccounts. \nAlthough Applicant admitted all the SOR-allegations in his October 2019 \nanswer, he disputed the two accounts identified at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.i, because of \nincorrect information in the accounts. Applicant\u2019s dispute fails because he did not \nprovide documented evidentiary proof to establish the basis of the disputes. AG \u00b6 20(e) \nis inapplicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the specific guidelines in the context of the \nnine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant has not furnished sufficient evidence to establish that his delinquent \ndebts are being resolved or under control. Notwithstanding Applicant\u2019s reliance on a \nlimitations statute to avoid responsibility for several of the SOR debts because they \nhave been removed from his credit report and are no longer enforceable, the debts are \n8 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nstill significant for security clearance purposes. See ISCR Case No. 15-02326 at 3 (App. \nBd. Oct. 14, 2016) In addition, relying on the statute of limitations does not constitute a \ngood-faith effort to eliminate financial difficulties. See ISCR Case No. 15-01208 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2016) In Guideline F cases, the DOHA Appeal Board has repeatedly \nheld that, to establish his case in mitigation, an applicant must present a \u201cmeaningful \ntrack record\u201d of debt repayments that result in debt reduction. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007) While an applicant is not required to show that \nevery debt listed in the SOR is paid, the applicant must show that he has a plan for debt \nresolution and has taken significant action to implement the plan. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 02-25499 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006) From the record presented, Applicant has no \nclear plan in place to repay the outstanding debts remaining in the SOR. After a full \nreview of the entire record from an overall common-sense point of view, Applicant\u2019s \nongoing financial problems have not been mitigated.   \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n Against Applicant \n   For Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1i: \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.c, 1.j, 1.k, 1.l:  \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nclassified information.

(Tr. 26-27, 40) This bankruptcy initially \nwas a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, and he made about six payments before he converted it to \na Chapter 7 bankruptcy. (Tr. 75; AE B) He estimated that about $25,000 was discharged \nin the 2003 bankruptcy. (Tr. 75) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges Applicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in around July 2007. \nApplicant said he was unable to make the monthly payments, and he elected to convert \nthe Chapter 13 bankruptcy to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy around January 2009. (Tr. 39) The \nbankruptcy documentation lists five secured debts totaling about $521,000, which \n2 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nincludes four vehicle loans and a real estate loan for about $442,000. (AE C at 15-16) He \nhad 10 unsecured nonpriority debts totaling about $3,800. (AE C at 18-20) The Chapter \n7 discharge was denied in around July 2009. \nBefore the 2007 bankruptcy was filed, Applicant was employed in information \ntechnology (IT) and making about $60,000 annually. (Tr. 24) The dot com crash resulted \nin the loss of employment to thousands of IT workers, including Applicant. (Tr. 24-25) \nApplicant was unemployed for six months. (Tr. 25) He purchased a home in 2007, and \nthe real estate market collapsed. (Tr. 42) His second spouse\u2019s annual income was about \n$40,000. (Tr. 43) His wife was in a vehicle accident, and she suffered a concussion. (Tr. \n44) After the accident, she was unable to work outside their home. (Tr. 44) At the time of \nher accident, his annual income was about $80,000. (Tr. 45)  \nApplicant elected to file for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy initially in order to stop the \nforeclosure of his residence. (Tr. 27-28, 49) He believed filing for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy \nwould assist in completion of a rehabilitation plan on their mortgage. (Tr. 50) The \nmortgage payment was not included in the Chapter 13 payment, and they were unable to \nafford the mortgage and Chapter 13 payments. (Tr. 51) He could not remember the \namount of his Chapter 13 monthly payments. (Tr. 79) Applicant believes the conversion \nto a Chapter 7 discharge may have been unsuccessful in discharging his debts because \nit was too soon after the previous Chapter 7 discharge in 2003. Eight years is the current \nwaiting period between Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharges.

(HE 4) \nApplicant\u2019s mortgage lender paid Applicant $10,000 to leave his residence in good \ncondition and the lender received the property without having to go through the \nforeclosure process. (Tr. 46, 48) The $10,000 payment may have occurred after the \nbankruptcy was dismissed. (Tr. 80) He used the $10,000 to pay some debts. (Tr. 52) \nApplicant and his spouse moved in with her parents for six months. (Tr. 49) His spouse \nshared the $20,000 settlement from her vehicle accident with her siblings and parents, \nand it was not used to address their debts. (Tr. 53, 77) Applicant\u2019s divorce from his second \nwife was final in 2012, and at that time, his annual income was about $90,000. (Tr. 54) \nIn 2014, Applicant married for the third time. (Tr. 57) In March 2017, they \npurchased a home. (Tr. 59) The monthly mortgage payment was about $3,400.

(Tr. 29-37, 101-115; AE K at 172-174) \nThe general sense of their statements is that Applicant is prudent with his spending, \nmature, honest, and trustworthy. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence.

May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating \nconditions. Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the mitigation \nsection, infra. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 which may be \nrelevant in this case are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear\nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nApplicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in around June 2002, and the bankruptcy \ncourt discharged about $25,000 in nonpriority unsecured debts in around February 2003. \nApplicant and his spouse filed for bankruptcy after his first wife lost her job. \nApplicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in around July 2007. Applicant was unable \nto make the monthly payments, and he elected to convert the Chapter 13 bankruptcy to \na Chapter 7 bankruptcy around January 2009. Applicant was unemployed for six months \nbefore he filed for bankruptcy. His second spouse was in a vehicle accident, and she was \nunable to work outside their home. The Chapter 7 bankruptcy was dismissed most likely \nbecause bankruptcy law requires an eight-year separation between Chapter 7 bankruptcy \ndischarges. \nApplicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in about June 2018, and he successfully \ncompleted the five-year term. Before he filed for bankruptcy, he had an excellent credit \nscore and no delinquent debts. He filed for bankruptcy after he was fired from his \nemployment in May 2017, and his spouse was not employed outside their home. He owes \nabout $20,000 in federal income taxes. He and his spouse believed her international \nemployer would pay about $10,000 of their tax debt. Now that his Chapter 13 bankruptcy \nhas been completed, he is able to resolve his federal income tax debt. \nApplicant utilized Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code from 2018 to 2023 to \nestablish his financial responsibility. The U.S. Courts website, \u201cChapter 13, Bankruptcy \nBasics\u201d \nwebpage, \navailable \nat \nhttps://www.uscourts.gov/services-\nforms/bankruptcy/bankruptcy-basics/chapter-13-bankruptcy-basics \n(HE 5) provides \ninformation about the Chapter 13 bankruptcy purpose and procedures as follows: \nA chapter 13 bankruptcy is also called a wage earner's plan. It enables \nindividuals with regular income to develop a plan to repay all or part of their \ndebts. Under this chapter, debtors propose a repayment plan to make \ninstallments to creditors over three to five years. If the debtor's current \nmonthly income is less than the applicable state median, the plan will be for \nthree years unless the court approves a longer period \"for cause.\" (1) If the \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \ndebtor's current monthly income is greater than the applicable state median, \nthe plan generally must be for five years. In no case may a plan provide for \npayments over a period longer than five years. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1322(d). During \nthis time the law forbids creditors from starting or continuing collection \nefforts. . .  \nChapter 13 offers individuals a number of advantages over liquidation under \nchapter 7. Perhaps most significantly, chapter 13 offers individuals an \nopportunity to save their homes from foreclosure. By filing under this \nchapter, individuals can stop foreclosure proceedings and may cure \ndelinquent mortgage payments over time. Nevertheless, they must still \nmake all mortgage payments that come due during the chapter 13 plan on \ntime. Another advantage of chapter 13 is that it allows individuals to \nreschedule secured debts (other than a mortgage for their primary \nresidence) and extend them over the life of the chapter 13 plan. . . . Finally, \nchapter 13 acts like a consolidation loan under which the individual makes \nthe plan payments to a chapter 13 trustee who then distributes payments to \ncreditors. Individuals will have no direct contact with creditors while under \nchapter 13 protection.  \n \n* * * \nDebts not discharged in chapter 13 include certain long-term obligations \n(such as a home mortgage), debts for alimony or child support, certain \ntaxes, debts for most government funded or guaranteed educational loans \nor benefit overpayments, debts arising from death or personal injury caused \nby driving while intoxicated or under the influence of drugs, and debts for \nrestitution or a criminal fine included in a sentence on the debtor\u2019s conviction \nof a crime. To the extent that they are not fully paid under the chapter 13 \nplan, the debtor will still be responsible for these debts after the bankruptcy \ncase has concluded. Debts for money or property obtained by false \npretenses, debts for fraud or defalcation while acting in a fiduciary capacity, \nand debts for restitution or damages awarded in a civil case for willful or \nmalicious actions by the debtor that cause personal injury or death to a \nperson will be discharged unless a creditor timely files and prevails in an \naction to have such debts declared nondischargeable. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1328, \n523(c); Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4007(c). (HE 5) \nThe bankruptcy court is required to assess an applicant\u2019s ability to pay his creditors \nand must establish a payment plan based on ability to pay.

There are clear indications that his financial \nproblems are being resolved and are under control. His finances do not cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Financial considerations security \nconcerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount \nconcern. A careful weighing of a number of variables in considering the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept is required, including the totality of his or her acts, omissions, and motivations. \nEach case is decided on its own merits, taking into consideration all relevant \ncircumstances and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful analysis. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge and the PSAB should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant or continue \nnational security eligibility \u201cmust be an overall common-sense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the [pertinent] guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My \ncomments under Guideline F are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed in my discussion of that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment. \nApplicant is a 54-year-old systems engineer. In 2002, he received a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in information systems. His resume includes additional information about his \nprofessional training and experience. \nApplicant filed for bankruptcy in 2002, 2007, and 2018. His nonpriority, unsecured \ndebts were discharged in 2003 and 2023. His financial problems were caused by \ncircumstances beyond his control. His income was reduced because of unemployment of \nhimself or his spouse or both. Before the loss of his job in 2018, he did not have any \ndelinquent debt.

He received financial counseling. He showed good faith and acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. He has ample income to maintain his financial responsibility. \nHe understands that maintenance of his financial responsibility is necessary for him to \nretain his security clearance. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd.

The case was assigned to me on January 6, 2023. On January 17, 2023, \nDOHA issued a notice scheduling a video-teleconference hearing for February 15, \n2023. \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. \nDepartment Counsel submitted \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8, which were admitted without objection. \nApplicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through J, which were \nadmitted without objection. I held the record open to allow Applicant the opportunity to \nsubmit additional documentation. \nApplicant submitted his federal income tax returns for tax years 2018, 2020, and \n2021. (AE K, AE L, and AE M) He later submitted signature pages for those returns, \nsigned on June 10, 2022. The signature pages are appended to each document (AE K, \nAE L, and AE M, respectively). Department Counsel initially objected to admission of \nthe documents on the grounds that it was not clear when they were prepared and \nsubmitted. Applicant then provided a May 11, 2022 e-mail from his tax preparer (AE N), \nand Department Counsel withdrew his objection. Applicant also submitted two reference \nletters. (AE O and AE P) His post-hearing submissions are all admitted without \nobjection. The record closed on March 29, 2023. DOHA received the hearing transcript \n(Tr.) on February 28, 2023. \nFindings of Fact  \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6 1.a. He admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d, while \ndenying the amounts alleged. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e -1.o, questioning the legitimacy of \neach account. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough \nand careful review of the pleadings and the record evidence, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 42 years old. He has never married and has no children. He has had \na clearance previously. He has been a federal contractor since 2012 and has been with \nhis current employer since March 2018. He works as an information technology (IT) \ntechnician. He has an annual salary of about $70,000. During the baseball season, he \nalso works a part-time job in concessions. This helps him provide further aid to his \nfamily and helps pay his bills. (Tr. 52-56) He lives by himself in a rental apartment. (Tr. \n10, 52-56, 105) \nApplicant disclosed some past-due debts on his SCA and discussed debts in \nfurther detail in his background interview, in May 2020. (GE 1, GE 2) He submitted an \nInterrogatory response to the CAF in July 2020 about his debts, and disclosed that he \nwas resolving his debts through debt-relief company L. He said that he had settled and \nresolved some debts and was working on others. He also disclosed some delinquent \ntaxes.

He provided federal income tax transcripts from the IRS for tax years 2017-2020 \nand state tax returns and other documents from tax years 2017 and 2019. (GE 3, GE 4, \nGE 5) This was how he became aware that his 2018 return was unfiled. (GE 3; Tr. 43) \nThe SOR alleges failure to file federal tax returns and about $25,500 in past-due \nfederal and state income taxes (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.c) as well as just over $15,000 in other \ndelinquencies. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d-1.o) The tax issues are established by Applicant\u2019s \ninterrogatory responses and tax transcripts. (GE 3-6) The other debts are established \nby credit reports from May 2020 and September 2021. (GE 7-8) He updated his SOR \nresponse in February 2023. (AE D) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant failed to file his federal income tax returns (i.e., \ntax returns) as required, for tax years 2018 and 2020. GE 3 and GE 4 reflect that when \nApplicant submitted his second Interrogatory response, in April 2021, he provided IRS \ntax transcripts from March 2021, a month earlier. At that time, his 2018 federal return \nwas unfiled (and also late), and his 2020 federal return was unfiled (but, at the time, not \ndue yet, until April 2021, a date that was extended due to the COVID-19 pandemic). \nApplicant filed his federal tax returns for TY 2018, 2020, and 2021 in June 2022, \nwith the assistance of a tax preparer. For TY 2018, he owed no balance. For TY 2020, \nhe owed $615. For TY 2021, he was due a $390 refund. (AE K-N; Tr. 39) He therefore \nfiled his 2018 and 2020 federal tax returns late. He has filed all of his past-due federal \nreturns. (Tr. 48-52, 62-70, 99-102) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($5,641, for TY 2017) and 1.d ($12,300, for TY 2019) concerns past-\ndue federal income tax debt. (GE 4) Applicant is unsure how these tax debts came \nabout. He is not yet on a repayment plan but intends to establish one. He has yet to \ncontact the IRS to start that process. He believes he owes between $10,000 and \n$13,000, but this is undocumented. He believes any refunds from other tax years (2018, \n2020, 2021) would be directed towards those debts. (Tr. 44-48, 52, 73-76, 97-102) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c ($2,592, for TY 2019) concerns past-due state income tax debt. (GE \n5) Applicant said he believed he owed only about $600 at this point because his state \ntax refunds had been redirected to address his tax debt. (Tr. 46-48, 52, 70-72, 97-98) \nHe provided tax documentation regarding refunds from TY 2021 ($2,901) and TY 2022 \n($3,969), both of which reflected that they were \u201capplied to other tax years.\u201d (AE I- J) \nThis suggests that his past-due state tax debt to be resolved is more than just the \n$2,592 owed for TY 2019, though the amount remaining and owed is unclear.  \nThe remaining SOR debts are all consumer accounts or utilities. Applicant \npartially admitted them in his Answer but was unsure the accounts or the debt amounts \nwere legitimate. He accepted responsibility for all the accounts at his hearing. (Tr. 77) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($1,233) is an account that has been charged off by a bank. Applicant \nsaid in his answer that the account was in the process of being paid.

The dealer called and \nsaid the account has been paid off, though Applicant said he did not make payments to \ndo so. AE G, an excerpt from a credit report, shows a zero balance.

(Tr. 90-91; AE H) \nSOR \u00b6 1.o ($142) is an account placed for collection by a cable or internet \nprovider. Applicant said he paid it, but this is undocumented.

One of Applicant\u2019s uncles is a retired Air Force master sergeant and \ncurrent government contractor. He has known Applicant for more than 35 years. \nApplicant is respectful and diligent. He is a caring and helpful family member. He is \ngoal-oriented and a hard worker. (AE A) An aunt is also a retired federal employee. She \nworked with him at her place of employment for a time in the past. He is a hard worker, \ngood family member, and is knowledgeable, honest, and trustworthy. (AE B) \nA co-worker and friend attested to Applicant\u2019s trust and confidence in difficult \npersonal times. Applicant has good moral character, and he deserves a second chance. \n(AE C) A former supervisor noted that Applicant possesses many fine qualities, \nincluding integrity, punctuality, and good communication skills. He handles tasks \nefficiently and is knowledgeable and goal oriented. He is dedicated to his family. (AE O) \nAnother co-worker attested to Applicant\u2019s work ethic and adherence to the rules and \nrequirements regarding protection of sensitive and classified information. (AE P) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline sets forth several conditions that could raise security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;   \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant incurred past-due state and federal income tax debts and other debts, \nduring a period of financial hardship for his family. He also failed to file some tax returns \non time. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. \nVoluntary compliance with such rules and systems is essential for \nprotecting classified information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 20, 2002). As we have noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is \nnot directed at collecting debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No, 07-08049 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same token, neither is it directed towards \ninducing an applicant to file tax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails \nrepeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the \nhigh degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted \naccess to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015); See Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union \nLocal 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. \n886 (1961).  \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis added). See ISCR \nCase No. 14-05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nConditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant has paid or resolved several of his SOR debts, including SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, \n1.h, 1.i, 1.n, and 1.o. The other debts alleged, however, are as yet unresolved. He has \nfiled his past-due tax returns, but his tax debts, particularly his federal tax debts, remain \nunresolved, and he has yet to put a plan in place to address them. Applicant\u2019s issues \nare therefore ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) partially applies to his taxes, since he cured his tax filing issues with \nthe aid of a tax preparer. But he has not pursued formal credit counseling and his debts \nare not yet resolved or under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not otherwise apply. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues began during a time of financial hardship for his \nfamily. AG \u00b6 20(b) therefore has some application. He has undertaken efforts to pay \nsome of his debts, but the largest concern is his unresolved tax burden. He has not \nundertaken reasonable, good-faith efforts to address that debt. He has not established \nthat AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) or 20(d) should fully apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) applies to Applicant\u2019s late-filed tax returns, which have now been \naddressed and filed (SOR \u00b6 1.a) However, he has yet to contact the IRS to address his \nsignificant past-due tax debt or to make payments towards resolving it. His state tax \ndebt, while smaller, is also not clearly resolved. AG \u00b6 20(g) therefore does not fully \napply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s financial hardships, his excellent work record, and his \nefforts to resolve his debts so far. While he has made progress, he needs to establish \nmore of a track record, particularly towards resolving his tax debts, to fully mitigate \nsecurity concerns. This is not to say that Applicant cannot be a suitable candidate for \nclassified access in the future. Overall, however. the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nApplicant did not mitigate financial security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h-1.i:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j-1.m:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.n-1.o: \nFor Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nclassified information.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 66 years old. She has been employed as a machine operator by a defense contractor since 1996. She has held a security clearance since 1996. She has an associate degree, which she earned in 2013. She is single with one adult child. (Item 2) The SOR alleges four defaulted student loans totaling $25,716 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.e, and 1.g); eight miscellaneous delinquent debts currently in collection totaling $9,927 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, 1.h-1.l); and one judgment for $1,728 taken in July 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.m). Applicant admitted owing the student loans, but states she thought the total was less. She admitted all but one of the remaining debts and stated she was making payments on four of them. She did not provide documentary support. The alleged debts are listed on a July 2017 credit report, a December 2020 credit report, an October 2022 credit report, and a record of judgment. (Items 1, and 5-9) Applicant provided no documentary or testimonial support.

Applicant did not submit any additional \nevidence. Department Counsel submitted an additional credit report dated May 24, 2023. \nI marked the May 2023 report as Item 10. Applicant did not respond to either the FORM \nor Item 10. The Government exhibits included in the FORM, as well as Item 10, are \nadmitted in evidence. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in SOR except the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.l. \nThe admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 66 years old. She has been employed as a machine operator by a \ndefense contractor since 1996. She has held a security clearance since 1996. She has \nan associate degree, which she earned in 2013. She is single with one adult child. (Item \n2) \nThe SOR alleges four defaulted student loans totaling $25,716 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, \n1.e, and 1.g); eight miscellaneous delinquent debts currently in collection totaling $9,927 \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, 1.h-1.l); and one judgment for $1,728 taken in July 2017 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.m). Applicant admitted owing the student loans, but states she thought the total was \nless. She admitted all but one of the remaining debts and stated she was making \npayments on four of them. She did not provide documentary support. The alleged debts \nare listed on a July 2017 credit report, a December 2020 credit report, an October 2022 \ncredit report, and a record of judgment. (Items 1, and 5-9) Applicant provided no \ndocumentary or testimonial support. \nIn her SCA, Applicant did not report her defaulted student loans, her debts that \nwere in collection, or the judgment taken against her. Applicant was interviewed by a \ngovernment investigator on March 11, 2021. She initially denied she had either defaulted \non any type of loan or was more than 120 days delinquent on any debt in the past seven \nyears. When confronted with her debts by the investigator she admitted most of them \nwere hers. Applicant admitted the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.e, and 1.g, the \nstudent loans, as well as the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.f, 1.h, 1.j -1.l. She disputed \nthe debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.i. Applicant stated she was surprised how large the \nstudent loans were. She stated she began to fall behind in her debts in 2018 when her \novertime hours were curtailed. Applicant noted she had worked out a payment agreement \nwith her mortgage lender as she had fallen behind and would contact the creditors \ndiscussed in the interview to attempt to work out a payment plan. (Item 4) \nAn October 2022 credit report shows Applicant had not made any payments on \nher student loans, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.e and 1.g. All were listed as having been placed for \ncollection, though are likely in a suspended status due to the COVID relief from the \nCoronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) of March 27, 2020, and \nsubsequent Executive Orders. That status will end in October 2023. The debts listed in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, 1.h - 1.l were also unchanged. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAfter I re-opened the record, Department Counsel submitted a more recent credit \nbureau report on May 24, 2023. The May 2023 credit report reflects only a single student \nloan in the amount of $16,316. The report states it is \u201cat least 120 days or more than four \npayments past due\u201d and notes the most recent payment was made in July 2019. This \nstudent loan was not alleged in the SOR. The student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, \n1.e and 1.g do not appear in the May 2023 credit report. While it is likely in a suspended \nstatus due to the CARES Act, Applicant has presented no evidence to demonstrate their \nstatus. The debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.j and 1.k are reported. The remaining debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.l do not appear in the May 2023 credit report. \nThough I did not consider it in making my determination, the May 2023 credit report \nindicates Applicant had an additional debt that was charged off. \nApplicant stated in her answer to the SOR that she was making monthly payments \non four of the debts in the SOR: (a) A credit card account for an account placed for \ncollection in the approximate amount of $2,339 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); (b) A credit card debt \ncharged off in the approximate amount of $1,224 (SOR \u00b6 1.f); (c) A credit card debt for \nan account placed for collection in the approximate amount of $677 (SOR \u00b6 1.h); and (d) \nA consumer loan debt for an account placed for collection in the approximate amount of \n$226 (SOR \u00b6 1.i). (Item 1) \nThough Applicant did not provide any additional support, none of the four accounts \nshe stated she is making monthly payments on appear in either the October 2022 credit \nreport or the May 2023 credit report. It appears, therefore, that Applicant has paid or \nsettled these debts. (Items 6, 7, and 10) \nThe judgment in SOR \u00b6 1.m taken by a creditor, was agreed to on February 18, \n2018, and is supported by the record of judgment. (Items 8 and 9) \nApplicant denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.l. regarding a $2,353 credit card on an \naccount that has been charged off. Applicant denied this in her answer to the SOR stating \nshe has \u201ca credit card with [the same credit card company] now.\u201d This argument is not \npersuasive. (Item 1) \nI have taken administrative notice that in March 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 \npandemic, the President directed the Department of Education (DoEd) to provide the \nfollowing temporary relief on DoEd-owned federal student loans: suspension of loan \npayments, stopped collections on defaulted loans, and a 0% interest rate. On March 27, \n2020, the CARES Act provided for the above relief measures through September 30, \n2020. See Federal Student Aid (FSA) website, ISCR Case No. 20-02787 at 3 n.1 (App. \nBd. Mar. 2022) This student loan debt relief was extended several times by subsequent \nExecutive \nOrders. \nSee \nhttps://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19. \nCongress recently barred any further extensions and DoEd has announced that student \nloan repayments will resume in October 2023.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(b) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including delinquent debts and \nmultiple defaulted student loans. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe four debts Applicant stated in her answer to the SOR on which she was making \nmonthly payments do not appear on the two most recent credit reports. Those debts are \nmitigated. She has known about the remaining debts for some period. She has provided \nno documentation, plan, or proof of any additional action regarding these debts. The \nAppeal Board has held that \u201cit is reasonable for a Judge to expect applicants to present \ndocumentation about the satisfaction of specific debts.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 09-07091 at \n2 (App. Bd. Aug. 11, 2010) (quoting ISCR Case No. 04-10671 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2006)). She stated in her interview she planned to pay other debts, including her student \nloans. However, intentions to resolve debts in the future are not a substitute for a track \nrecord of debt repayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that she acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that she made a good-faith effort to pay her debts. \nHer financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on her current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that the security concerns arising out \nof Applicant\u2019s remaining debts are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h-1.i: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j-1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

He seeks a Secret security clearance to \nenhance his position within the company. (Tr. 11-13, 38; GE 1) \nApplicant graduated from high school in June 2015. He was awarded a Bachelor \nof Science degree in business information technology in May 2019. (Tr. 13-15; GE 1, \nGE 2) Applicant has never married and has no dependents. (Tr. 15) \nDrug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nApplicant\u2019s history of drug involvement and substance abuse is established by \ndisclosures in his February 15, 2021 SF-86, in his January 24, 2022 response to DOHA \ninterrogatories that contained his March 30, 2021 Office of Personnel Management \n(OPM) Personal Subject Interview (PSI), in his undated SOR Answer, and in his hearing \ntestimony. (GE 1, GE 2) A summary of that drug involvement and substance abuse \nfollows. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that from about October 2012 through the present, Applicant \npurchased and used marijuana with varying frequency, adding that he intends to \ncontinue using marijuana in the future unless he holds a security clearance. In his SOR \nAnswer, Applicant admitted this allegation, adding that there was \u201cno evidence of \npsychological or physical dependence on the drug.\u201d He stated his use of marijuana \nwould end upon being granted a security clearance. (SOR Answer) \nAt his hearing, Applicant testified that he began using marijuana in high school in \nMarch 2012. While in high school, he purchased marijuana from a friend and described \nhis use as \u201c[m]aybe twice a year.\u201d While in college from 2015 to 2019, he purchased \nmarijuana \u201c[a]bout half of the times\u201d he used it, and described his use as \u201conce a week \non the weekends.\u201d The use of marijuana was not legal in his state of residence at any \npoint during the years 2012 to 2019. (Tr. 16-18) \nAfter graduating from college in 2019, until March 2022, Applicant\u2019s marijuana \nuse was the \u201cmost frequent . . . a couple times a week.\u201d During the period from 2019 to \nJanuary 2021, he drove to a location where he could purchase marijuana legally about \n\u201conce a month.\u201d In January 2021, he moved to his current state of residence where \nmarijuana is legal under state law. (Tr. 18-20) After this move, he purchased all of his \nmarijuana from state-licensed dispensaries. (Tr. 20-21) \nApplicant stopped using marijuana in March 2022 because he is more productive \nwhen not using marijuana. His career, relationships, health, and fitness are all better \nwithout the habitual use of marijuana.

(Tr. 21-22; AE A) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that from about January 2016 through at least March 2021, \nApplicant purchased and used the prescription medication Adderall that was not \nprescribed to him, adding that he intends to continue using Adderall without a \nprescription. In his SOR Answer, Applicant admitted this allegation, but denied that he \nintends to continue using Adderall without a prescription in the future. He stated that he \nhas not used Adderall since March 2021. (SOR Answer) \nAt his hearing, Applicant testified that he first used Adderall when he was a \nfreshman in college. A friend gave it to him when he was \u201ccramming\u201d for an \nexamination. Applicant stated that the Adderall helped him \u201cwith staying on task and \nbeing able to study for as long as [he] needed to study for and to retain the information \nto regurgitate that onto the test.\u201d The last time Applicant used Adderall was in March \n2021 when he was studying for a certification. He used Adderall infrequently in college, \nonce every two months or whenever he had a big project to complete. After college, he \nused Adderall \u201cmaybe once a quarter.\u201d (Tr. 26-29) \nApplicant corrected the number of times he used Adderall from the 50 times he \nlisted on his SF-86 to approximately 30 times. Applicant stopped using Adderall in \nMarch 2021 because, after evaluating the negative versus the positive benefits of using \nAdderall, he decided the negatives outweighed the positives. He obtained Adderall from \nfriends who had prescriptions for it. He previously stated that he intended to continue \nusing Adderall out of \u201cstubbornness.\u201d As previously stated in his SOR Answer, he does \nnot intend to use Adderall in the future. (Tr. 29-31; AE A) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that from about November 2016 through at least February \n2021, Applicant purchased and used ecstasy with varying frequency. In his SOR \nAnswer, he admitted this allegation, adding that his use of ecstasy was purely \nexperimental and mostly occurred while he was in college. He stated that he has not \nused ecstasy since February 2021. (SOR Answer) \nAt his hearing, Applicant reiterated that, as he stated in his SOR Answer, he last \nused ecstasy in February 2021. He described his ecstasy use as \u201cexperimental.\u201d He \nused ecstasy while in college \u201cduring a big party,\u201d and later at a \u201cfew music festivals.\u201d \nHe estimated that he used ecstasy four times. He purchased ecstasy one time and \nobtained it the other times from friends. He stopped using ecstasy because the \nnegatives outweighed the positives. (Tr. 31-33) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges that from about March 2019 through November 2020, \nApplicant purchased and used hallucinogenic drugs with varying frequency. In his SOR \nAnswer, Applicant admitted this allegation, adding that his use of hallucinogenic drugs \nwas purely experimental. He has not used hallucinogenic drugs since November 2020. \n(SOR Answer) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant reiterated what he wrote in his SOR Answer that he last \nused hallucinogenic drugs in November 2020.

(Tr. 34-36; AE A) \nApplicant has never participated in a drug rehabilitation program, nor has he ever \nbeen diagnosed with a substance abuse disorder.

That was in part to ensure he would pass his drug-screening test. \n(Tr. 37) Applicant never sold drugs, but reciprocated with individuals who had provided \nhim drugs by doing the same for them. (Tr. 37-38) \nApplicant works for an employer who requires a drug-free environment. His \nexplanation to continue using drugs, contrary to this policy, was because of \n\u201cstubbornness\u201d and for no good reason. He understood at the time when his employer \nhired him they had a drug-free policy. After passing his entry-level drug test when he \nwas hired in 2018, he has not been tested since. (Tr. 22-24) His job is full time remote, \nand he has no expectation that he will be required to report to an office environment. \n(Tr. 24-25) \nApplicant submitted a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. (AE A) Applicant stated \nthat he swallowed his pride and determined that a drug-free life is better than a life \nspent misusing and being involved with drugs. He believes that \u201cturning this page\u201d will \ngreatly improve his overall health and enhance his career and his relationship with his \nfamily.

He also \nenjoys reading and spending time with friends and family. (Tr. 40) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n5 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nAG \u00b6 24 describes the security concern concerning drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.  \nOne drug involvement disqualifying condition, in AG \u00b6 25(a) could raise security \nconcerns and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201cany substance misuse (see above \ndefinition).\u201d These proceedings were initiated after Applicant self-reported his history of \ndrug involvement and substance misuse on his SF-86, in his responses to his DOHA \nInterrogatories, and during his OPM PSI. His drug use was further affirmed or clarified in \nhis SOR Answer, and during his hearing testimony. Consideration of the applicability of \nmitigating conditions is required. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides four potentially applicable drug involvement mitigating \nconditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including but not \nlimited to:  \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility;  \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) can mitigate security concerns when drug offenses are not recent. \nThere are no \u201cbright line\u201d rules for determining when such conduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The \ndetermination must be based \u201con a careful evaluation of the totality of the record within \nthe parameters set by the directive.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, \n2004). For example, the Appeal Board determined in ISCR Case No. 98-0608 (App. Bd. \nAug. 28, 1997), that an applicant\u2019s last use of marijuana occurring approximately 17 \nmonths before the hearing was not recent. If the evidence shows \u201ca significant period of \ntime has passed without any evidence of misconduct,\u201d then an administrative judge \nmust determine whether that period of time demonstrates \u201cchanged circumstances or \nconduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-\n24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). In ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, \n2006), the Appeal Board reversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on \nthe absence of drug use for five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board \ndetermined that the judge excessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security \nclearance and the 20-plus years of drug use, and gave too little weight to lifestyle \nchanges and therapy. For the recency analysis, the Appeal Board stated: \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although \nthe passage of three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did \nnot, standing alone, compel the administrative judge to apply Criminal \nConduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of law, the Judge erred by \nfailing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply that \nmitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) \nwith ISCR Case No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe \nadministrative judge articulated a rational basis for why she had doubts \nabout the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at alcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) \n(citation format made). \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-11392 at 1-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2006) the Appeal Board affirmed \nthe administrative judge\u2019s decision to revoke an applicant\u2019s security clearance after \nconsidering the judge\u2019s recency analysis, stating:  \n7 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe administrative judge made sustainable findings as to a lengthy and \nserious history of improper or illegal drug use by a 57-year-old Applicant \nwho was familiar with the security clearance process. That history \nincluded illegal marijuana use two to three times a year from 1974 to 2002 \n[drug use ended four years before hearing]. It also included the illegal \npurchase of marijuana and the use of marijuana while holding a security \nclearance. \nSee also ISCR Case No. 02-10454 (App. Bd. Nov. 23, 2004) (sustaining denial of \nsecurity clearance for Applicant who used marijuana five times while holding a \nsecurity clearance with four years between most recent marijuana use and \nhearing). \nThe passage of time after ending drug use is not considered in isolation. \nApplicant\u2019s drug use after starting his current job with a drug-free defense contractor in \nJuly 2018, again after completing his February 2021 SF-86, and then using marijuana \none month after receiving his February 2022 SOR, is more significant in this case. See \nISCR Case No. 06-18270 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 7, 2007) (marijuana use after completing \nan SF-86 \u201cundercuts\u201d favorable application of the drug involvement recency mitigating \ncondition). \nApplicant acknowledged that he purchased and used marijuana from October \n2012 to March 2022, purchased and used Adderall from January 2016 to March 2021, \npurchased and used ecstasy from November 2016 to February 2021, purchased and \nused hallucinogenic drugs from March 2019 to November 2020, and purchased and \nused cocaine from November 2016 to February 2021. Applicant\u2019s drug use continued \nwhile knowing that his employer required a drug-free work place, and until one month \nafter receiving his SOR. \nApplicant has recently recognized the adverse impact of drug abuse on his life, \nand in connection with access to classified information. I accept Applicant\u2019s statements \nas credible, and that he sincerely intends to abstain from future drug possession and \nuse. AG \u00b6 26(a) applies, in part, to his illegal drug-related conduct because it was \nsomewhat infrequent. However, his continued drug use after accepting a position with a \ndefense contractor in July 2018 and use of marijuana one month after receiving his \nSOR, shows a profound lack of judgment. \nApplicant demonstrated his intent not to abuse illegal drugs in the future. His \nmost recent drug use was in March 2022, he has disassociated from drug-using \nassociates and contacts, he has avoided the environment where drugs were used, and \nhe has provided a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for \nrevocation of national security eligibility. AG \u00b6 26(b) applies. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(c) and 26(d) are \nnot applicable under the facts of this case. \nIn conclusion, Applicant possessed and used a variety of drugs on multiple \noccasions from October 2012 to March 2022.

He understands the adverse consequences from illegal drugs. Approval of \na security clearance, potential criminal liability for possession of drugs, and adverse \nhealth, employment, and personal effects resulting from drug use are among the strong \nmotivations for remaining drug free. More time without drug use is necessary to assure \nthat drug use is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. A longer period of abstinence without any drug use \nis necessary to demonstrate a sufficient track record of no drug abuse, to establish \nrehabilitation, and eliminate drug involvement as a bar to his access to classified \ninformation. \nWhole-Person Concept \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. Some of \nthe factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment. \nThe factors supporting continuation of Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility are \nnoteworthy; however, they are insufficient at present. Applicant achieved some \nimportant education and employment goals, demonstrating his self-discipline, \nresponsibility, and dedication. He served successfully as a summer intern during the \nsummer of 2018 until being granted full-time status with a defense contractor. His \nemployer had enough confidence in him to allow him to telework remotely in January \n2021. By all accounts, he is an honest, caring, diligent, intelligent, and responsible \nperson. He disclosed his drug use on his SF-86 and was forthright throughout his \nbackground investigation. He also disclosed his drug use to his family. Applicant \nunderstands why his drug possession and use was improper, and he does not intend to \nuse illegal drugs in the future. \nThe rationale for denying Applicant\u2019s clearance eligibility is more substantial. His \ndecisions to possess and use illegal drugs beginning in October 2012, and continuing \n9 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nafter gaining employment with a defense contractor in July 2018, were imprudent, \nirresponsible, reckless, and illegal. Resulting security concerns were further \ncompounded by the variety and duration of his drug abuse. He did not complete a drug \nrehabilitation or counseling program. His extensive use of drugs over a ten-year period, \nand his most recent marijuana use three months before his hearing, raise questions \nabout his ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. (See AG \u00b6 \n24.) More time without illegal drug use is necessary to find him to be fully rehabilitated, \nand to entrust him with eligibility for access to classified information. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse concerns are not mitigated. For the reasons stated, Applicant is not \neligible for access to classified information at this time.  \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Other than the Commander\u2019s Report of Disciplinary or \nAdministrative Action, which notes the debarment without explanation, there is no other \ndocumentation, as required by Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR) \u00a7 9.406-3, about \nthe details of the debarment, specifically the notice of proposal to debar, the written \nfindings of fact \u2013 which are required whenever the decision to debar is not based on a \nconviction or civil judgment, or the debarring official\u2019s decision \u2013 which would have \nspecified the actual term of debarment imposed. (GE 5-6) \nApplicant offered little information about the CID investigation or his eventual \ndebarment during the background investigation or in response to the SOR. He did not \ndisclose the debarment on his October 2018 security clearance application in response \nto Section 25: Investigations and Clearance Record: \u201cHave you EVER been debarred \nfrom government employment?\u201d He also failed to disclose his employment with the \nfederal contracting company identified in the CID investigation. \nDuring the October 2004 to September 2009 period covered by the CID \ninvestigation, Applicant reported on his security clearance application that he worked for \nCompany A as a production control clerk from December 1999 to February 2005. He also \nreported that he worked for Company B as a production control lead from March 2005 to \nDecember 2009. Both positions for Company A and B occurred on the same military \ninstallation in the Middle East identified in the CID report. Applicant also reported that he \nworked for Company C between December 2008 and December 2009, as a supply \ntechnician for a contract on a U.S. military installation in Asia. During the period when his \ndebarment was issued and in effect, Applicant disclosed employment with Company D, \nalso a federal contracting company on the same military installation in the Middle East \nidentified in the CID investigation. There is no explanation for why he failed to disclose \nthe employment identified in the CID investigation, or how he remained an employee of \na federal contracting company, or on a U.S. military installation after receiving the \ndebarment. \nIn an October 2019 interview with a background investigator, Applicant was asked \nto explain why he did not disclose the debarment on his security clearance application. \nApplicant told the investigator that he forgot about that period. He explained his \ninvolvement in the investigated conspiracy as involuntary. He explained that his friend, a \nsenior Army officer, asked him to give an envelope to a junior Army officer. Applicant \nclaimed that he was unaware of the contents of the envelope and did not suspect anything \nwas amiss until he was interviewed by Army investigators weeks later. The Army CID \ninvestigation determined that the senior Army officer also had a financial interest company \nthat employed Applicant. Applicant claimed that he recalled receiving a letter about the \ndebarment. He reported that he complied with the letter and did not challenge the \ndecision. He told the investigator that he was not sure why he was debarred and \ncontinued with his life.

In his answer to the SOR, Applicant reiterated that he did not learn of \nthe debarment until his 2016 divorce proceeding. He provided a Debarment Termination \nNotice from the Army, dated October 27, 2016, which indicated that Applicant\u2019s \ndebarment was terminated effective October 25, 2016, and that he had been removed \nfrom the award management system as an excluded party. (GE 2, GE 9) \nThe investigation also revealed that Applicant owed four creditors $37,951 in \ndelinquent debt. Applicant incurred the debts on four credit cards, during a period of \nunemployment. He also used the credit cards to pay the legal expenses related to his \n2016 divorce. He enrolled the four debts in a debt consolidation service. The service, to \nwhich he pays $574 each month, negotiates settlements with the creditors when possible \nand pays off the accounts. At the time he enrolled in the program, the debts were in good \nstanding. He did not realize that the service would allow the debts to become delinquent \nbefore resolving them. As of February 2022, the debt consolidation service resolved the \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d ($9,462). He did not provide any documentation regarding the \ncurrent state of his finances.  (GE 2, GE 7-8) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nadministrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 \ndescribing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative \ngoal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person \nconcept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nUnresolved delinquent debt is a serious security concern because failure to \u201csatisfy \ndebts [or] meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 18). The SOR alleges that Applicant owes over $37,000 on four \ndelinquent accounts. Applicant\u2019s admissions and the credit reports in the record establish \nthe Government\u2019s prima facie case. The following disqualifying conditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe record contains sufficient information to mitigate the concerns raised by his \ndelinquent debt. He is making a good faith effort to resolve the delinquent accounts by \nusing a debt consolidation service, which has resolved the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. \nThe following mitigating conditions applies: \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nPersonal Conduct \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. Of \nspecial interest is any failure to cooperate or provide truthful answers during national \nsecurity investigative or adjudicative process. (AG \u00b6 15) The redacted Army CID \ninvestigation (GE 6), FBI records (GE 4), the Commander\u2019s Report of Disciplinary or \nAdministrative Action (GE 5), the Notice of Debarment Termination (GE 2), as well as \nApplicant\u2019s admissions (GE 2) are sufficient to establish the Government\u2019s prima facie \ncase under the personal conduct guideline. The following personal conduct disqualifying \ncondition applies: \nAG \u00b6 16(e) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncharacteristic indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \nIn 2013, Applicant was one of several subjects of an Army CID investigation into \nallegations of a conspiracy to defraud the Government to obtain a federal contract \u2013 a \nbreach of financial trust potentially disqualifying under the financial considerations \nguideline. The investigation also substantiated allegations Applicant engaged in criminal \nconduct to include conspiracy to defraud the government, bribery, and bid-rigging \u2013 which \nmay be potentially disqualifying under the criminal conduct guideline. The limited \nevidence in the record is insufficient for an adverse determination under either of those \nguidelines. However, there is sufficient evidence to support a negative whole-person \nassessment under the personal conduct guideline that Applicant may not properly handle \nclassified information. \nI disagree with the Government\u2019s assertion that \u201cApplicant deserves some \nmitigation for his involvement in the fraudulent scheme,\u201d citing the Department of Justice\u2019s \ndetermination of lack of probable cause against Applicant and the age of the misconduct \nwith no recurrence of similar behavior. Neither implication in a conspiracy to defraud the \ngovernment nor debarment are insignificant matters that can easily mitigated by the \npassage of time. Applicant\u2019s minimization of the investigation and debarment, as well as \nthe conflicting statements and omissions in his security clearance application and during \nthis adjudication cast doubt on his current trustworthiness and reliability. \nDebarment is the exclusion of an individual or company from doing work with the \nfederal government. According to FAR \u00a79.406.4, the debarment period should not exceed \nthree years. However, the debarment period can be longer under certain circumstances. \nThe Army debarred Applicant for six years, indicating that the Army considered \nApplicant\u2019s conduct a serious violation of the FAR. Also, FAR \u00a7 9.406-3, dictates that a \ncontractor facing debarment receive Due Process, including notice of the specific reasons \nfor the proposed debarment and an opportunity to respond. \nA proposed six-year debarment, which meant Applicant could not work in his \ncareer capacity as a federal contractor for six years, is significant and given its potential \nfinancial impact, cannot be easily ignored. Even if Applicant waived his right to Due \nProcess by choosing not to respond to the notice of proposed debarment, it is unlikely \nthat he was not aware of the debarment process as it occurred, or that he did not receive \nthe debarring official\u2019s decision. It is also unlikely that he forgot about the debarment as \nhe reported to a background investigator in an October 2019 interview. His statements \nthat he did not learn about the debarment until his 2016 divorce proceeding are not \ncredible. \nFurthering the concerns about Applicant\u2019s credibility is his failure to report the \nmatter on his security clearance application, though it is unclear why the omission was \nnot alleged as a falsification. The record also contains unanswered questions of potential \nsecurity significance regarding why Applicant did not list the contracting company from \nthe Army CID investigation on his security clearance application, or how he continued \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nworking as the employee of a federal contracting company on the same military \ninstallation during his period of debarment. \nThe record contains too many inconsistencies, conflicting statements, and \nunanswered questions to mitigate the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s debarment \nand his failure to fully disclose or provide details about the incident. Applicant bears the \nresponsibility to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts proven by the Government, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security clearance \ndecision. (Directive, Additional Procedural Guidance, \u00b6 E3.1.15) Applicant has failed to \nmeet his burdens of production and persuasion. Accordingly, the matter is resolved in \nfavor of the Government and none of the personal conduct mitigating conditions apply. \nBased on the record, doubts exist about Applicant\u2019s ongoing suitability for access \nto classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-\nperson factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). The purpose of the adjudication is to make \u201can examination \nof a sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person \nis an acceptable security risk.\u201d (AG \u00b6 2(a)) In 2013, Applicant was investigated as part of \na conspiracy to defraud the government to obtain a federal contract \u2013 an act contrary to \nthe Government\u2019s interests. Applicant continues to act against the best interests of the \nGovernment and in breach of his fiduciary duty as a clearance holder, by failing to provide \nfull, frank, and candid disclosures to the Government about his involvement in the alleged \nconspiracy and the details of his debarment. Given his long history of dishonesty with the \nGovernment, he is not a suitable candidate for ongoing access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Personal Conduct: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Financial Considerations: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.d \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nBased on the record, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for a security clearance.

There were no AE I or Y, and AE Z is a duplicate of AE Q. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 56-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He spent two years \nat a U.S. military service academy until he was honorably discharged for medical \nreasons. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree earned in 1989. He is married with four children. \n(Transcript (Tr.) at 44-45; GE 1, 2; AE Q) \nApplicant became the chief executive officer (CEO) of a company (hereinafter \n\u201cCompany\u201d) in 2016. Terms of his employment included that he could be terminated for \ncause for a number of reasons, including \u201ccommission of any other act that is, in the \nBoard\u2019s good faith judgment, reasonably likely to bring you, the Company or its affiliates \ninto disgrace or public disrepute or materially harm its or their goodwill or business \nreputation or that of it\u2019s or their employees, officers, directors or customers,\u201d and \u201cfailure \nto obtain or maintain all security clearances required for the performance of your \nduties.\u201d He held security clearances in the past, but it is unclear if he had one at the \nCompany before he was granted a clearance in 2017. (Tr. at 29, 45-46; GE 4) \nApplicant is a longtime photographer. He sometimes used a pseudonym for his \nphotography and for social media accounts. He did photo shoots of women who were \nscantily clad or in their underwear. He stated that he did not do nude photography, the \nphotos were essentially what could be found on the cover of a legitimate magazine, and \nthe women wore more clothes than what would be found on the average beach. He \nstated that his wife was aware that he did the shoots and even helped arrange some of \nthem. (Tr. at 27-29, 52-54, 65-67; AE A, C, D, R) \nIn about 2015, Applicant met a woman (Ms. A) online. They interacted online and \nmet in person twice in 2017, once in the United States while he was on a business trip \nand once in the United Kingdom (UK). He was in the UK with his family. He stayed in \nthe UK for work after his family left, and he met Ms. A. He agreed to a photography \nsession with her that was supposed to include a male model, but the male model \ncancelled. He took about 30 to 40 shots. He stated that she took off her top at one point, \nbut she was covered by a sheet or blanket. He denied that it was an \u201cerotic photo \nshoot.\u201d He uploaded the photos to a drop box account and shared the link with Ms. A. \nHe stated that a few weeks later, per her request, he deleted all images he had of her. \n(Tr. at 28, 32, 47-52, 55-58; GE 3, 14; AE A, K) \nApplicant admitted that he had an online \u201caffair\u201d with Ms. A that included \n\u201csexting,\u201d but he denied that there was ever any physical contact. He stated that he \nbroke off the relationship in 2017 after a family member passed away, and he became \nrecommitted to his family. He told his wife about the affair, and he thought that was the \nend of it.

Applicant\u2019s wife described Ms. A\u2019s actions as \nthreatening, and that they \u201cfelt bullied and it was bordering on blackmail.\u201d He retained \nan attorney who responded to the demand letter.

(Tr. at 54-60; GE 9; AE O) \nMs. A\u2019s attorney contacted Applicant\u2019s employer in 2018. The attorney stated that \nApplicant pursued a relationship with Ms. A for several years before their relationship \nthat culminated in sex during a business trip to the United Kingdom. The attorney \nindicated that Applicant took a naked picture and other intimate pictures of Ms. A \nwithout her consent. The attorney indicated that Applicant used the company\u2019s \nelectronic devices to communicate with Ms. A, and that he told her that he was doing so \nat home, at work, and while traveling for business. The attorney stated that Ms. A was \nnot seeking monetary compensation, but that she wanted \u201cto make sure [Applicant] has \nnone of her images and that none of her images are saved elsewhere (for example on \n[Company\u2019s] computers or phone).\u201d1 (GE 10) \nThe attorney also referenced that Applicant posed as a photographer to convince \nyoung women to undress for him, and that he distributed the materials without the \nindividuals\u2019 consent. The attorney indicated that Applicant told Ms. A that underage \nwomen had lied to him about their age. (GE 10) \nThe Company retained a professional to conduct a forensic examination of \nApplicant\u2019s work phone and laptop. Numerous adult and pornographic websites were \napparently accessed through the phone. Nothing of significance was accessed through \nthe laptop. A picture of a clothed man (Applicant) taking a picture through a mirror of \nhimself and a woman in her underwear (not Ms. A and not Applicant\u2019s wife) were found \nthrough the phone. Applicant testified that the photo was taken in 2014, and his wife \nwas aware that he did the shoot, and his wife may have helped with the styling. (Tr. at \n52-54; GE 11, 12, 15) \nApplicant asserted that at the Company\u2019s request, when he first started at the \nCompany, his personal phone and account were synched to his work phone, which \nmade everything he did on his personal devices available through his work phone. \nWithout getting too much into the technical realm, that statement is accepted. He stated \nthat he never used the work phone to view anything inappropriate, and that all of the \nsearches were conducted on his personal phone and may have been done by his son. \n(Tr. at 29-31, 63-65; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3; AE A, F-H, S) \n1 As indicated in the Statement of the Case, I am not considering any matter in the letter for the truth of \nany controverted issue.

Applicant denied the allegation. He stated that photography was \na hobby, but not erotic photography or photography of a sexual nature, rather, he took \npictures of musical bands and other non-sexual photography. He indicated that he first \nmet Ms. A in a hotel bar during a business trip in May 2017. She approached him \nbecause she noticed his camera. They engaged in conversation, kept in virtual contact, \nand agreed to meet in the United Kingdom when they both separately were going to be \nthere. While there, he took about 30 photos of her, which did not involve nudity, but she \ndid remove her top. They had lunch afterwards. He stated that he had engaged in no \nother behavior of a similar nature. (Tr. at 33, 60-61; GE 13, 14) \nThe Company reduced Applicant\u2019s verbal statement to writing. The Company \nindicated that the allegations potentially implicated the Company and Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance and requested a sworn affidavit by early November 2018. Applicant \nprovided an affidavit in which he wrote: \nSince 1985, photography is a hobby of mine, but not erotic photography or \nphotography of a sexual nature, rather, I take photos of family, friends, \nmusical bands and other non-sexual photography. \n \n \n \n \n \n*\n*\n* \n \n \nI misspoke during our conversation in [city]. In the moment, I was \nshocked, rattled, and embarrassed to find myself being specifically \nquestioned about whether I had sex with a woman in a hotel room by a \nmember of the Board. I had not met [Ms. A] before the meeting at the \n[hotel]. However, our occasional virtual relationship extended back before \nI joined [Company].

(GE 14) \nApplicant stated in the affidavit that many of the photos found on the phone were taken \nby his son. (GE 14) \nThe Board of Directors convened and determined that there was a basis to \nterminate Applicant\u2019s employment \u201cfor cause\u201d due to lack of truthfulness during the \ninvestigative process and because his behavior could jeopardize his ability to maintain a \nsecurity clearance. A termination letter was prepared, which stated that the conduct that \nformed the basis of the termination included: \n\u2022 Engaging in the creation of erotic photography and related activities (together, \nthe \u201cActivities\u201d);  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u2022 making false statements to the Company during the course of a Company \ninvestigation concerning the extent and nature of and other details concerning \nthe Activities;  \n\u2022 submission to the Company of a sworn affidavit containing false statements \nconcerning the Activities; and \n\u2022 use of Company resources, including a Company-issued iPhone, in connection \nwith the Activities, in violation of Company policy. (GE 17) \nOn November 26, 2018, the Board met with Applicant and showed him the \nadditional information from the forensic search of the phone, at which time he admitted \nto the behavior and resigned. The termination letter was never issued to Applicant \nbecause he resigned. (Tr. at 36-40; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 18, 19; AE A, B, \nE, G, L, T, V, X) \nApplicant stated that he was shocked, dismayed, embarrassed, and angry when \nhe was first confronted by the Company, and \u201cin the moment, [he] told them half-truths.\u201d \nHe stated that he \u201cdidn\u2019t tell them all that they wanted to know, [he] only told them parts \nof what they, [he] would argue deserved to know.\u201d Applicant asserted at his hearing that \nhe did not believe his resignation was because of \u201cmisconduct.\u201d He felt it was because \nhe was \u201cnot forthcoming\u201d to the Board. He stated that he believes that if he was \nforthcoming, he could have stayed with the Company in spite of the other issues. (Tr. at \n33-35, 61, 69-71; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3; AE A) \nApplicant did not intend to stay with the Company even if issues with Ms. A and \nhis truthfulness never came up. His family remained in another state when he relocated \nto take the CEO position. He also had another business opportunity.

Nearly three years of commuting every week from [City B] \nwas negatively impacting my family life, especially for my wife and two \nhigh school-age daughters.

(AE B, E, N, O) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during the national \nsecurity investigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative;  \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information;  \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer\u2019s time or resources; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a \nThe information alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a comes directly from the termination letter \nthat was never issued. The conduct in the letter can still be addressed even if the letter \nwas never issued. SOR \u00b6 1.a alleges: \nYou were terminated from your employment at [Company] in about November \n2018, for the following misconduct: Engaging in the creation of erotic \nphotography and related activities (together, the \u201cActivities\u201d) in violation of \ncompany policy; making false statements to company during the course of a \ncompany investigation concerning extent and nature of and other details \nconcerning Activities; submission of a false sworn affidavit to company \nconcerning the Activities; and misuse of company re[s]ources, including a \ncompany-issued iPhone, in connection with the Activities. \n \n  \nTermination from Employment \nThis part of the allegation does not raise any disqualifying conditions for two \nreasons. Applicant was not terminated, and it does not allege conduct by Applicant; it \nalleges a result of his conduct. \n \n \n \n \nCreation of Erotic Photography and Related \u201cActivities\u201d \nThe Company may have been concerned with more than Applicant\u2019s activities \nwith Ms. A. I am limiting the discussion to her. Applicant admitted that he had an online \n\u201caffair\u201d with Ms. A that included \u201csexting,\u201d but he denied that there was ever any \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nphysical contact. The photos he took resulted in actions against him and her contacting \nthe Company. Applicant\u2019s wife described Ms. A\u2019s actions as threatening, and that they \n\u201cfelt bullied and it was bordering on blackmail.\u201d His conduct with Ms. A reflects \nquestionable judgment, and it created vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and \nduress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(e) are applicable. \n \n \nFalse Statements to Company \nApplicant lied to his employer about his involvement with Ms. A. He did so \nverbally and in a sworn affidavit. His conduct with Ms. A opened the Company up to \npotential litigation, and it was relevant information for his security clearance. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n16(b) and 16(e) are established. \n \n \nMisuse of Company Resources \nThere were indicators that numerous adult and pornographic websites were \napparently accessed through Applicant\u2019s work phone, which would have been against \ncompany policy. However, the actions could have been done on Applicant\u2019s personal \ndevices and then without his knowledge synched over to his work phone. That part of \nthe allegation is not established. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges Applicant intentionally falsified Section 13A of his January \n2021 SF 86 when he answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question that asked if he had been fired; quit \nafter being told he would be fired; left by mutual agreement following charges or \nallegations of misconduct; or left by mutual agreement following notice of unsatisfactory \nperformance, and therefore failed to disclose that he was terminated by the Company. \nApplicant was not terminated by the Company, but he did leave by mutual agreement \nfollowing charges or allegations of misconduct. I find that he intentionally provided false \ninformation in his answer to that question, which he compounded with a misleading \nexplanation. AG \u00b6 16(a) is applicable. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges Applicant intentionally provided false information during his \nMay 2021 background interview when he stated that he voluntarily resigned from the \nCompany, and therefore failed to disclose that he was terminated by the Company. As \nindicated above, he was not terminated by the Company. AG \u00b6 16(b) is not applicable. \nThis allegation is not established, and it is concluded for Applicant. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant lied on multiple occasions to his wife, his employer, and during his \nbackground investigation. I have no confidence that he was completely honest with me. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. Personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology  \nThe security concern for use of information technology is set out in AG \u00b6 39: \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \nand information. Information Technology includes any computer-based, \nmobile, or wireless device used to create, store, access, process, \nmanipulate, protect, or move information. This includes any component, \nwhether integrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, \nsoftware, or firmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations. \nAG \u00b6 40 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable: \n(e) unauthorized use of any information technology system. \nAs discussed under personal conduct, the numerous adult and pornographic \nwebsites visited could have been done on Applicant\u2019s personal devices and then \nwithout his knowledge synched over to his work phone. There are no applicable \ndisqualifying conditions. SOR \u00b6 2.a is concluded for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E and M in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant refuted \nuse of information technology security concerns, but he did not mitigate the personal \nconduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline M: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n12 \n",

Findings of Fact Applicant was born in Iraq and is 43 years old. He has never married and has no children. He received a high school diploma in Iraq in 1997 and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in Iraq in 2002. In 2003, he was drafted into the Iraqi army. The Iraq War started shortly thereafter, and he served for 22 days before the war ended with the defeat of the Iraqi army and the overthrow of the Saddam Hussein government (Hussein Regime). He worked as a linguist for the U.S. military in Iraq in 2008-2009. In 2010, at the age of 35, he left his family behind and immigrated by himself to the United States. He had only one relative in the U.S., a cousin of his mother, and no friends. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2015. He relinquished his Iraqi citizenship in 2016. He then worked as a linguist 2 for the U.S. military in Jordan in 2016-2017. He presently has a job opportunity to work for the U.S. Army in Kuwait as a linguist.

Applicant \nresponded to the amendment on October 13, 2022 (Amendment Answer). Department \nCounsel was ready to proceed on September 29, 2022. The case was assigned to me on \nOctober 11, 2022. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice \nof Hearing on November 2, 2022. The case was heard on December 8, 2022.

Department Counsel also provided a Request for \nAdministrative Notice (AN), which is discussed below. Applicant offered 11 exhibits, \nmarked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through K, which were also admitted without \nobjection. At Applicant\u2019s request, I left the record open to provide him with the opportunity \nto supplement the record. On December 16, 2022, he timely submitted eight additional \ndocuments marked as AE L through AE S. AE L is Applicant\u2019s Request for Administrative \nNotice, which is also discussed below. AE M through S were admitted without objection. \nApplicant also testified on his own behalf. (Tr. at 6-12.) \nProcedural Rulings \nThe Government requested in its AN that I take administrative notice of certain \nfacts relating to the Republic of Iraq (Iraq). Department Counsel provided a five-page \nsummary of those facts, supported by six U.S. Government documents pertaining to Iraq. \nThe documents provide elaboration and context for the factual summary. I take \nadministrative notice of certain facts included in the Government documents attached to \nAN. These facts are limited to matters of general knowledge, not subject to reasonable \ndispute. They are set forth in the Findings of Fact, below. As noted, Applicant also \nsubmitted a Request for Administrative Notice, a three-page document identified as AE \nL.

(Tr. at 13-\n16, 22, 24, 29, 43-45, 49; GE 1, Sections 2, 9, 12, 17, 18.)  \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant has five family members who are citizens and \nresidents of Iraq: his mother (SOR \u00b6 1.a), a brother (SOR \u00b6 1.b), a sister (SOR \u00b6 1.c), a \nsister-in-law (SOR \u00b6 1.d), and an uncle (SOR \u00b6 1.e). The SOR alleged that his brother \nworks for the Iraqi Ministry of Oil as a mechanical engineer. (SOR \u00b6 1.b.) His sister is \nalleged to work for the Iraqi Ministry of Construction as a Chief Engineer Assistant. (SOR \n\u00b6 1.c.) His sister-in-law is alleged to work for the Ministry of Oil as a Chief Engineer. (SOR \n\u00b6 1.d.) The SOR further alleged that his uncle served in the Iraqi Ministry of Defense as \na colonel. (SOR \u00b6 1.e.) The Government also alleged that Applicant will inherit properties \nin Iraq. One of the properties has a value of approximately U.S. $500,000. (SOR \u00b6 1.e.) \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted each of the SOR allegations.  \nAs noted, the Government amended the SOR before the hearing date to add an\nallegation under Guideline E. In SOR \u00b6 2.a, the Amendment alleged that Applicant was \nterminated by Company A in about January 2018 \u201cfor being rude and abusive to locally \nhired support staff and other employees.\u201d The Amendment further alleged that he refused\nto sign termination paperwork, went Absent without Leave, and failed to demobilize at a\nU.S. Army base in the United States in accordance with company policy. Applicant denied\nthe allegation in the Amendment Answer. \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 1 - Guideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for a \nclearance because he has contacts and property interests in Iraq that may create a \ndivided allegiance or a conflict of interest, and be a national security concern. His contacts \nand property interests also potentially create a risk that Applicant may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \na foreign interest. \nAt the hearing, Applicant described his relationships with the five family members \nand the family properties identified in the SOR. \n1.a: At the time of the hearing, Applicant was in Iraq taking care of his mother, who \nhad recently had a foot amputated due to illness. His siblings were unable to take care of \nher because they have full-time jobs and families, and have no free time to do so. None \nof Applicant\u2019s family members, including his mother, know that he is applying for a DoD \nsecurity clearance. After becoming a U.S. Citizen in 2015, Applicant sponsored his \nmother to become a resident alien, which status was granted in February 2017. If \nApplicant returns to the United States without a clearance, he testified that his mother \nwould return with him once she is able to travel. If Applicant is granted a clearance and \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndeploys to Kuwait, he is uncertain whether his mother would relocate to the United States \nat that point because she would be alone. (Tr. at 13-14, 17, 18-19, 21, 25-27, 47; AE J; \nAE K; AE K.) \n1.b: Applicant and his brother do not have a close relationship. When Applicant is \noutside of Iraq, he only speaks with his brother once every six months. His brother does \nnot know what Applicant does as a linguist. During his current stay in Iraq, Applicant sees \nhis brother occasionally when Applicant needs help taking their mother to see her doctor. \nHe does not see his brother otherwise. His brother has been working as a mechanical \nengineer for the Iraqi Ministry of Oil since before 2003, when the U.S. and its allies \ndeposed Hussein Regime. His brother has never been a member of the Ba\u2019ath Party. \nApplicant does not see his brother on holidays when he is in Iraq. (Tr. at 17-18, 26-27, \n49-50.) \n1.c: The above description of Applicant\u2019s relationship with his brother applies to his \nrelationship with his sister, except she works for the Ministry of Construction as a chief \nengineer assistant. Applicant sees his sister less frequently than he sees his brother. (Tr. \nat 18-19, 26-27.) \n1.d: Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law is the wife of his brother. Applicant has no contact \nwith her. She works as a civil engineer for the Iraqi Ministry of Oil. (Tr. at 19, 28.) \n1.e: Applicant\u2019s uncle was a colonel in the Iraqi Ministry of Defense and retired in \n1989. Applicant has no contact with him. He last saw his uncle in 2013-2014 when \nApplicant\u2019s father was sick. His uncle served in the Iraqi Air Force. (Tr. at 19-20, 30-31.) \n1.f: When Applicant\u2019s father died in 2015, Applicant\u2019s mother inherited her \nhusband\u2019s property, which includes a building with four apartments. She also inherited \nthe family home. The apartment building has an estimated value of about U.S. $500,000; \nand the home is worth about U.S. $300,000. Applicant and his two siblings will inherit the \nmother\u2019s properties when she dies. Applicant is unwilling to go through the paperwork \ninvolved in claiming his share of his mother\u2019s estate. He has no intention of asking his \nbrother and sister to share one third of their inheritance with him. He explained that when \nhe immigrated to the United States in 2010, he cut all of his ties to Iraq and now wants \nnothing to do with the country, his siblings, or the family property there, even though the \nfamily properties have a significant value. His attorney suggested that there are serious \nIraqi governmental restrictions on removing funds from that country that would impede \nApplicant, as a U.S. citizen, from transfering funds out of Iraq if he were to liquidate his \none-third share of the properties. (Tr. at 20, 22-23, 31-33, 48.) \nParagraph 2 \u2013 Guideline E, Personal Conduct \nApplicant denies the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a. The allegation is based upon a \ntermination letter from Company A addressed to Applicant (GE 4) in which Company A \naccused Applicant of being rude and abusive to the local workers in Country X during his \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndeployment there in 2016-2017. He claimed that this was just an excuse used by his \nemployer to remove him from his job. He explained that his problem with Company A \nbegan at a staff meeting with a U.S. Army officer who distributed a form regarding \nCompany A\u2019s ethics and treatment of its linguists to be answered anonymously. One of \nthe linguists spoke openly and praised Company A and his supervisor. Applicant raised \nhis hand and said that he and others do not share that opinion. He then had a private \nconversation with the officer and spoke negatively about how Company A treated its \nlinguists. (Tr. at 36-37; Amendment Answer.) \nLater in December 2017, Applicant\u2019s supervisor received a call from Applicant \nabout his comments to the Army officer and sent Applicant an email stating that the U.S. \nArmy asked for his removal for being rude to local staff members. Applicant discussed \nhis removal with his Army point of contact. The contact was surprised and denied that this \ncame from Army. Applicant was subsequently advised that his removal order came \ndirectly from his employer and that the Army could do nothing to help him. He was advised \nthat he would be transferred to Kuwait in three days. He arrived at the airport in Kuwait \nand no one was there to meet him. He had no directions as to where to go. After six hours \nof waiting in the airport, he reached a supervisor by email and the supervisor told him to \ntake a bus to a U.S. base in Kuwait and wait for instructions. He had sent his bags to \nCompany A\u2019s offices in Kuwait, and they were never delivered to him at the transient \nhousing at the base. He kept asking representatives of Company A what they planned to \ndo with him, and he was told that they would let him know. (Tr. 37-41; Amendment \nAnswer.) \nWhile he was in Kuwait, Applicant\u2019s brother called him and told him he needed to \ncome to Iraq because their mother required immediate surgery and no one in the family \ncould take care of her. When he spoke to Company A about his need for a four-day \nemergency leave, he was told that a U.S. Army officer would need to approve his request. \nTime passed without a response. Applicant felt that it was important for his mother that \nhe be in Iraq for a few days to help with her care. He advised his employer that he was \nleaving for Iraq for a brief trip to care for his mother and would return. When he got to \nIraq, he received a text message from his employer asking where he was. He responded \nthat he was in Iraq as he had advised. He received a reply stating that he was fired, and \nhe was instructed to turn in his badge. He sent his CAC to his employer. His mother\u2019s \nhealth worsened, and he stayed with her in Iraq. When she recovered from her surgery \nin 2018, Applicant and his mother returned to the United States. His mother eventually \ntravelled back to Iraq and Applicant joined her in December 2021, when her health again \nrequired his assistance. (Tr. at 41-44; Amendment Answer.) \nMitigation and Whole-Person Evidence \nApplicant testified with sincerity that at the start of the coalition\u2019s war to overthrow \nthe Hussein Regime in 2003, he felt that he was seeing the beginning of an important \nhistorical change, or in his words \u201cthe light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d Prior to that war, the \nfuture of the Iraqi people was uncertain. After the war, he was pleased to have the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nopportunity to work as a linguist for the U.S. Army in 2008, to help his country transition \nfrom dictatorship to democracy and a better life for its citizens. Over time, he became \ndisillusioned that the Iraqi people themselves were creating new problems both against \nthe U.S. Government\u2019s efforts to create a functioning government and society, and \nagainst each other in religious strife. He felt unsafe and unhappy. His disillusionment \nultimately led him to leave his family and the country of his birth to emigrate to the United \nStates in 2010. (Tr. at 34-35; AE Q.) \nBefore immigrating, Applicant worked for Company A as a linguist for the U.S. \nArmy in Iraq during the period August 2008 through September 2009. In that role, he \nwould accompany U.S. troops on missions outside of their compound and risk his life as \nan unarmed linguist. He also translated sensitive military and police records for U.S. and \nIraqi officials, and acted as an interpreter for military transition teams. (Tr. at 23-24; AE \nD; AE G.) \nAfter immigrating, he worked in the United States in at least three jobs in the period \n2012 to 2015. Applicant worked for Company A in a second deployment, this time in \nCountry X, during the period September 2016 to January 2018. In that position, he worked \nwith U.S. Army training teams as part of an operational engagement program training \nCountry X police. His duties included translation work with the trainees and keeping local \ncivilians out of harm\u2019s way during live-fire operations. The commanding officer wrote, in \na Memorandum for Record, that Applicant \u201cperformed exceptionally well as a linguist \nduring Entry Control Point training\u201d and \u201ccontributed to [building a] strong relationship \nbetween the [Country X\u2019s forces] and the U.S. forces.\u201d (AE E, AE F.) \nApplicant was issued a badge to enter his base in Iraq and a CAC to enter the \nbase in Country X where he lived and worked. He never had any security issues. During \nhis work for the U.S. Army in Iraq and Country X, or at any time thereafter, he never \ndiscussed his work as a contract linguist for the U.S. Army with any family members. No \none in his family knows that he is seeking a DoD security clearance. (Tr. at 18, 23-24, \n31.) \nIraq \nApplicant has significant contacts with Iraq. Accordingly, it is appropriate to look at \nthe current conditions in that country. Iraq is a constitutional parliamentary republic. Its \nmost recent parliamentary elections were in October 2021. They were generally \nconsidered free and fair, and an improvement over the prior elections in 2018. \nU.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk of violence directed against them. The U.S.\nDepartment of State\u2019s Travel Advisory for Iraq urges U.S. citizens not to travel to Iraq due \nto terrorism, kidnapping, armed conflict, and civil unrest. According to a February 2022 \nassessment by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Iranian-supported \nproxies are capable of launching attacks against U.S. forces and persons in Iraq and \nSyria. Iran remains a problematic actor across the region with its backing of Iraqi Shia \n \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmilitias, which are the primary threat to U.S. personnel in Iraq. Islamic State in Iraq and \nSyria (ISIS) is a designated terrorist organization and is active in Syria and near the Iraq \nborder. Also, ISIS leaders remain committed to their vision of building a self-styled global \ncaliphate headquartered in Iraq and Syria and are working to rebuild its capabilities. \nISIS and its associated terrorist groups indiscriminately commit attacks and violent \natrocities in Iraq despite improved Iraqi government control. Although ISIS maintained its \ncapability to conduct deadly terrorist attacks in Iraq, these attacks resulted in fewer \ncasualties in 2020 than in previous recent years. \nSignificant human rights issues exist in Iraq. They range from unlawful and \narbitrary killings, including extrajudicial killings by the Iraqi government and forced \ndisappearances by the government, to serious restrictions on free expression and the \nmedia and serious government corruption. \nThe United States maintains vigorous and broad engagement with Iraq on \ndiplomatic, political, economic, and security issues in accordance with the U.S.-Iraq \nStrategic Framework Agreement. The Agreement reflects the important relationship and \ncommon goals the two countries share. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 - Guideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in AG \n\u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline B sets forth nine conditions in AG \u00b6 7 that could raise security concerns \nand may be disqualifying in this case. The following four conditions are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or personal \nconflict of interest. \nApplicant has family contacts, connections, and valuable family properties in Iraq \nthat raise all of the above security concerns. He often lives with his mother, either when \nhe is caring for her in Iraq due to her medical condition or when they reside together in \nthe United States. His future inheritance rights involve substantial property interests in \nIraq. The administratively noticed country conditions in Iraq raise the security concerns to \nlevel of a heightened risk. \nIt needs to be noted that the mere possession of close family ties with a person in \na foreign country is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if \nonly one relative lives in a foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, \nthis factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could \npotentially result in the compromise of classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 at 3 (App. Bd.

The \nfollowing four conditions have possible application in this case: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nApplicant has virtually no relationships with his five family members in Iraq with the \nexception of his mother, who lives with him part-time in the United States and is a U.S. \npermanent resident alien. He left his family in 2010 before his father died and, at age 35, \nhe turned his back on them and his country of birth for a new life in the United States. The \nfact that his brother, sister, and sister-in-law are all employed by the Iraqi government, \nand his uncle was a senior officer of the Iraqi military under the Hussein Regime, however, \nraises his family profile and presents at least a risk that Applicant could be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of his relatives and the interests of the \nUnited States. That risk does not rise to the level of being likely to arise, in part because \nhis family members are unaware of the nature of his past and potentially future work for \nthe U.S. Army and of the fact that he is applying for a DoD security clearance; but it cannot \nbe confidently concluded that the risk is \u201cunlikely.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(a) is only partially established \nby the facts in this case. \nThere is no conflict of interest, however. Applicant\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation \nto his family members in Iraq is minimal and his loyalties to his country of choice, the \nUnited States, are deep as first evidenced in 2007 by his service to the U.S. Army in Iraq \nas a linguist. Applicant\u2019s relationship with his mother comes closest to creating a potential \nconflict of interest. That potential concern is addressed by his prior service to the U.S. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \nArmy. Applicant has established that he complied with security procedures and \nregulations in the context of dangerous, high-risk circumstances in which he made a \nsignificant contribution to national security. These circumstances give credibility to \nApplicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to recognize, resist, and report attempts \nat coercion or exploitation. See ISCR Case No. 06-25928 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 9, 2008). \nAG \u00b6 8(b) is fully established. \nAs noted, Applicant has relationships with his family members in Iraq is limited, \nexcept his relationship with mother. He communicates with them infrequently and typically \nonly in connection with his mother\u2019s health and care. His relationship with his mother, \nhowever, renders the mitigating condition in AG \u00b6 8(c) only partially established. \nAG \u00b6 8(f) is fully established. Applicant\u2019s future property interests in his mother\u2019s \nestate upon her death is of no interest to Applicant. He intends to refuse his inheritance \nafter his mother\u2019s death, rendering it unlikely that the inheritance will result in a future \nconflict. He credibly testified that he has no interest in his family property, and that \nproperty could not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure Applicant.    \nBased upon an overall view of the facts of this case and the mitigating conditions, \nApplicant has established mitigation of security concerns under Guideline B. Paragraph \n1 is found for Applicant. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 15, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \n \n \n \nGuideline E sets forth seven conditions in AG \u00b6 16 that could raise security \nconcerns and may be disqualifying in this case. The following condition is potentially \napplicable: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; and \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty of rule violation. \nAs noted below, the whole-person evidence in this case does not support a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that \nthe individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. Accordingly, \ndisqualification under AG \u00b6 16(d) has not been established. \nAssuming arguendo that the Government\u2019s limited evidence supports an \nunfavorable whole-person assessment and possible disqualification under AG \u00b6 16(d) \nhas been established, then the burden shifts to Applicant to mitigate the security \nconcerns. AG \u00b6 17 provides six conditions that could mitigate security concerns under \nGuideline E. The following two conditions have possible application in this case: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability.  \n \nBoth of the above mitigating conditions have been established. Applicant\u2019s \nbehavior was infrequent and happened under such unique circumstances as to be \nunlikely to recur. It does not cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. Also, there is no evidence that the extent of any personal misconduct by \nApplicant was anything more than minor, i.e., being \u201crude\u201d in a military/police training \nenvironment. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s testimony denying the accusations of Company A \nagainst him was credible, rendering the one document in the record supporting the \nallegation as insufficient to substantiate the accusations. In addition, Company A treated \nApplicant poorly by sending him to Kuwait without any plans or oversight. Company A \nthen failed to respond to Applicant\u2019s request for a brief period of emergency leave, which \nwas then followed by his immediate termination. The facts support a conclusion that \nCompany A\u2019s actions and unresponsiveness were deliberate with the intention of creating \na pretext for terminating Applicant. His termination was in retaliation for his negative \ncomments about his treatment as a linguist by his supervisors in Country X. Applicant has \nmitigated any such security concerns. Paragraph 2 is found in favor of Applicant. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s potential for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has provided evidence \nof his strong ties to the United States even in the context of the limited number of years \nhe has actually resided here and the lack of close friends and relatives in the United \nStates, other than the Army soldiers with whom Applicant served. He has twice benefitted \nthe national interests of the United States by volunteering to work for its military, first in \nIraq and then in Country X. Now he wishes to work for the U.S. military in Kuwait and to \nuse his experiences, skills, and education for the benefit of U.S. national security. He left \nthe country of his birth after being disillusioned by the failure of its people to become a \nsafe, cohesive society without sectarian violence led by armed militias. He maintains a \nresidence in the United States, he pays taxes in the United States, and he has brought \nhis mother to the United States to sponsor her for a Green Card, which permits her to live \nwith him and for him to care for her in her old age. The allegation under Guideline E is \nnothing more than an unsubstantiated allegation of relatively minor wrongdoing, which \neven if true, does not outweigh the overwhelmingly favorable whole-person evidence in \nthe record. Overall, the record evidence does not create any questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s present suitability for national security eligibility. \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.F: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance.

The authors of her reference letters enthusiastically support her application \nfor a public trust position. (Tr.37-38; AE K \u2013 AE M)  \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance [or a public trust position].\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). The Government\u2019s authority \nto restrict access to classified information applies similarly in the protection of sensitive, \nunclassified information. As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security or other sensitive information \nand to determine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation. See Id. at 527. \nThe standard that must be met for assignment to sensitive duties is that, based \non all available information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such \nthat assigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security. Department of Defense contractor personnel are afforded the right to \nthe procedures contained in the Directive before any final unfavorable access \ndetermination may be made.   \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, an \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.

An administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial \nand commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant which may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to sensitive information. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security and trustworthiness suitability. See \nISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance [or access to \nsensitive information].\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance [or \ntrustworthiness] determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, \n484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nThe protection of the national security and sensitive records is of paramount \nconsideration.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a trustworthiness \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d The evidence of record establishes \ntrustworthiness concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). Further review is necessary. \nAG \u00b6 20 lists five potentially applicable mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the \napplicability of mitigating conditions as follows:  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance.

Sep. 24, 2013). \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because there \nis more than one delinquent debt and her financial problems are not isolated. Her debt \nremains a \u201ccontinuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See \nISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-\n03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)).  \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) is partially applicable, and 20(d) is fully applicable. Although \nApplicant cannot receive full credit for the debts she incurred on behalf of her former \nboyfriend, she can receive partial credit for moving costs and the financial fallout \nfollowing her breakup with her boyfriend. Applicant is, however, able to receive full \ncredit for contacting the credit union holding four of her SOR debts and making payment \narrangements with them. She had been making intermittent payments to them as early \nas 2017 when she could afford to do so. She currently has a structured plan in place \nalbeit somewhat recent, but has shown her commitment to repayment by setting up \ndirect debit payments. As noted, she settled her two other SOR debts in November \n2019, well before the CAF issued her February 25, 2022 SOR. \nApplicant did make an effort to seek financial counseling, but her efforts to do so \ndid not achieve the desired results. However, she has demonstrated through her actions \nthat she is determined to overcome her indebtedness. She knows that regaining \nfinancial responsibility is essential to qualify for a public trust position and has taken \nreasonable and measured steps to resolve her debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(e) are not \napplicable. \nApplicant entered into four separate agreements with her credit union to pay off \nher four debts with them shortly before her hearing. Given her available financial \nresources, the records supports the fact that she is doing her level best to pay off her \nremaining creditor. The Appeal Board has established the following basic guidance in \ncases such as this: \nan applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has \npaid off each and every debt listed in the SOR.

Rather, a reasonable plan (and \nconcomitant conduct) may provide for the payments of such debts one at \na time. \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (citations and quotation marks \nomitted). \nWhen taking into account Applicant\u2019s financial situation, I view her corrective \naction to be reasonable. She settled and paid two of her six SOR debts over two years \nbefore her hearing and has a plan in place to resolve her remaining four debts. Given \nthe progress Applicant had made and continues to make, she is on a clear path to \nbecoming debt-free \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public trust position \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). The discussion in the Analysis \nsection under Guideline F is incorporated into this whole-person section. However, \nfurther comments are warranted. \nBoth the mitigating conditions under Guideline F and the whole-person analysis \nsupport a favorable decision. \nTo review, Applicant is a 37-year-old licensed vocational nurse consult manager, \nwho has been employed by a defense contractor since May 2021. As a result of her \ndecision to financially assist her former boyfriend, she fell into debt after he failed to \nrepay her, leaving her with the four remaining unpaid SOR debts. Applicant has taken \n8 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreasonable and measured steps to regain financial responsibility. She recognized the \nimportance of regaining financial responsibility, not only for purposes of obtaining a \npublic trust position, but also going forward as a productive member of society. She \naccepts responsibility that the debts she incurred for her former boyfriend and is \ncommitted to doing the right thing by her creditor. \nApplicant\u2019s approach to resolving her debts is measured and responsible. I was \nimpressed with her demeanor. It is clear from her actions that she is determined to \nregain financial responsibility. She is well regarded by his employer. She has a job that \nwill provide her with the income to repay her creditors. Applicant understands what she \nneeds to do to maintain financial responsibility. Her efforts at debt resolution have \nestablished a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of debt repayment. \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole-person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the adjudicative guidelines. \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the SOR are as follows: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFor Applicant \nFor Applicant \n Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f: \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant \neligibility for a public trust position.

He said that while he was married \nfrom 2004 to 2015 he used alcohol on a limited basis but there were times he used it in \nexcess and to the point of intoxication. (Tr. 43-46) \nIn 1993, at the age of 18, Applicant was arrested and charged with consumption \nof alcohol by a minor. He was a passenger in a car when it was pulled over by the police. \nHe was given a field sobriety test and failed. He pleaded no contest and was required to \nattend a class for those charged with driving under the influence (DUI) of alcohol and to \nperform community service. He completed both requirements. (Tr. 46-47; GE 3) \nIn 1995, Applicant was driving from a club to his fraternity house. He was stopped \nby the police, given a field sobriety test, and failed. A blood alcohol test was not \nadministered. He was charged with DUI. He pleaded guilty, was required to attend DUI \nschool, perform community service, and was on probation. He completed the terms of the \nsentence. (Tr. 47-48; GE 3) \nIn 1999, Applicant was driving to his fraternity house after leaving a party. He \ncompleted a U-turn too fast and was stopped by police. He completed a field sobriety test \nand was arrested because he was impaired. He was 24 years old at the time. He was \ncharged with DUI. He pleaded guilty. As part of his sentence, he was required to complete \na 12-week alcohol abuse treatment program, perform community service, and he was on \nprobation. Applicant credibly testified that since his 1999 DUI arrest and conviction, he \nhas had no additional police involvement regarding his alcohol use. He testified that he \nwas young and made some bad decisions. (Tr. 48-51; GE 3) \nApplicant testified that to comply with his sentence, from April 2000 to September \n2000, he attended the court-ordered group therapy as an outpatient. He said the therapy \nwas not specific to alcohol abuse. He successfully completed the program and did not \nreceive a diagnosis. There was no aftercare required. He testified that at that time he did \nnot feel like he needed to attend Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). He said he tempered his \nalcohol consumption but continued to drink. He finished college and moved on with his \nlife and left the fraternity scene. (Tr. 51-53, 130) \nApplicant testified that in February 2019 he changed his alcohol consumption \nbecause he thought he had a problem. He discussed it with his fianc\u00e9e. He made the \ndecision that day to attend an alcohol recovery program and entered the program the \nsame day. He said that he and his fianc\u00e9e had arguments that were fueled by alcohol. \nWhen they moved in together his alcohol consumption increased. She would drink two to \nfour drinks a night and alcohol was part of their relationship. His decision to attend \ntreatment ended their relationship. He said he did not think she wanted to live in a sober \nhouse. He was in treatment for 30 days. During that time, she ended the relationship and \ntold him not to return to the house. They had been together for three years. He said the \nbreak-up was emotionally crushing.

He attended AA and leaned on the community \nduring his breakup and attended additional meetings. He said it was difficult to stay sober. \nWhen he completed the rehabilitation program, he said he was never told of any type of \ndiagnosis. He attended AA for about a year until approximately March 2020 and stopped \nbecause he was not comfortable with the spiritual aspect of AA. Instead, he began to \nparticipate in Smart Recovery, which is an alternative to AA that has more of a cognitive \npsychological and scientific approach to sobriety. Participants develop a community of \npeople and meet regularly to analyze behavior and actions. He started by attending three \nmeetings a week, and since the spring of 2020, he attends weekly meetings. He finds it \nis easier for him to subscribe to their program than to AA. He did not receive an \nindependent evaluation regarding a diagnosis of bipolar disorder while in treatment. \nApplicant testified he told the treatment facility that he was being treated for the condition. \n(Tr. 58-68, 139-144; AE E) \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in April 2019. He \nquestioned some of the information the investigator included in the summary of his \ninterview. He said he does not think he would have been able to estimate how many \ndrinks he had per occasion while in college. He denied 6 to 12 beers every weekend. He \nadmitted that from December 2017 to February 2019 he was consuming alcohol three to \nsix times a week and towards the end of this period it was between 50-75 ml of vodka \neach time. (Tr. 53-55, 132) \nApplicant admitted he relapsed in July 2021. He testified that he had not really \naccepted that he had a problem or that he was an alcoholic. He was going through the \nmotions to see if he could control himself. He started to drink and was unable to stop for \nseveral days. In September 2021, he tried to drink again because he was still not \nconvinced that he did not have control. He binge drank for several days. (Tr. 68-72, 138-\n139) \nApplicant testified that on September 13, 2021, he had an epiphany and realized \nhe could not keep doing what he was doing. He committed to complete sobriety that day. \nHe acknowledged that he tested the waters before because he did not want to believe he \nhad no control over his alcohol consumption. He thought he could control it but could not. \nHe testified that he knows he can totally abstain, but if he has one drink, he cannot stop. \nHe credibly testified that he will not consume alcohol ever again. He accepts he is an \nalcoholic, and he will always be in recovery. He signed a letter of intent never to consume \nalcohol again. He admitted that in the past he may have said he would not consume \nalcohol again and did, but when he made those statements, he had not accepted the fact \nthat he is not in control and is an alcoholic. He now has. (Tr. 68-76; AE K) \nPsychological Conditions \nFrom about August 2017 to May 2018, Applicant received treatment from a \ncounseling center. He was seen by Dr. T.S., a psychologist. He said he was in a new \nrelationship and was having anxiety. Dr. T.S. diagnosed him with adjustment disorder \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwith mixed anxiety, and depressed mood. He saw her minimally once a month and \nsometimes twice a month. (Tr. 76-78, 82, 118-119; AE D) \nApplicant testified that he received treatment from J.A., a nurse practitioner with a \npsychiatric specialty, from about April 2018 to November 2020. He disputes that he \nrefused medication and said he took all prescribed medication as required. He said J.A. \ndiagnosed him with bipolar disorder and prescribed him between 10 and 15 medications. \nHe testified that some of medications had serious side effects, others required monitoring \nthrough blood work; and some made him feel catatonic. His fianc\u00e9e at the time told him \nhe needed to have J.A. check his medications. J.A. conducted her work through email \nand changed his medication multiple times. He decided he could not accept her trial and \nerror approach. He and J.A. frequently discussed his medications and dosages. When \nJ.A. diagnosed him with bipolar disorder, he said it was a surprise because he had never \nhad a manic episode. He researched the different levels of bipolar disorder, and he \nbelieved his symptoms could be attributed to other psychological disorders. He was \nskeptical of the diagnosis but agreed to continue on medication. He testified that J.A. was \naware that he consumed alcohol but not that he had a problem. She never mentioned \nthat a potential alcohol use disorder could possibly mimic symptoms of bipolar disorder. \n(Tr. 60, 78-83, 93, 119-125, 135-137; GE 4) \nApplicant testified that he informed Dr. T.S. of J.A.\u2019s diagnosis of bipolar disorder. \nHe said she was surprised and warned him to be cautious. He considered getting a \nsecond opinion but thought he would give the medication a try. He testified he always \nfollowed J.A.\u2019s directions when she changed his medications. He said he would continue \nto take the prescribed medications until something new was prescribed. In 2020, he \nstopped seeing J.A. because she left the practice, and her new practice did not accept \nhis insurance. (Tr. 78-83) \nIn December 2020, Applicant began seeing R.J., a nurse practitioner with a \npsychiatric specialty. He said she did not believe he had a bipolar disorder, and she did \nnot treat him for it. Her concern was his insomnia. She prescribed medication for his \ninsomnia. He testified that she never diagnosed him with bipolar disorder. He informed \nR.J. that he had gone to alcohol treatment and that he had an alcohol use disorder. He is \non two medications she prescribed that are not habit forming and do not interfere with his \ncommitment to sobriety. In June 2021, R.J. left the practice and Applicant was transferred \nas a patient to M.B, a nurse practitioner with a psychiatric specialty. (Tr. 83-89) \nApplicant continues to take two medications prescribed by M.B. and she has \nchanged his dosage because he wants to take as little medication as possible and \nminimize side effects. He testified that M.B. has not diagnosed him with bipolar disorder. \nShe is aware of his past alcohol abuse. A statement was provided by M.B. (March 18, \n2022) verifying that Applicant has been under her care since June 2021 and meets with \nher monthly. He has been consistently compliant with his treatment plan and reports long-\nterm stability at current medication dosages. He has diagnoses of sleep disorder and \ngeneralized anxiety disorder.

He plans to continue his treatment with \nM.B. (Tr. 89-95, 148; AE C) \nApplicant testified that when he was being treated by J.A. he felt terrible. He said \nsince being treated by M.B. he is able to function and feels balanced. He described his \nfunctioning level as the difference between night and day, from when he was being treated \nby J.A. He now has his issues under control with the treatment provided by M.B. He has \nfollowed her treatment plan and credibly testified that he would not discontinue any \nmedication without consultation from a medical professional. (Tr. 89-95) \nSince September 2022, Applicant also has been a patient of J.B, a licensed clinical \nsocial worker. He meets with her at least monthly and sometimes twice a month. He sees \nher about dealing with his sobriety and how to lead a sober life and potentially having a \nromantic relationship in the future. She provided a letter stating Applicant has been \nconsistently compliant with his treatment plan and attendance. He is engaged in therapy \nto better himself in both his personal and professional life and relationships. He continues \nto exhibit long-term stability in his sobriety and medication compliance. (AE J) \nApplicant testified that he is not afraid to seek help and has been proactive since \n2017 with regards to his mental health. He is committed to maintaining his medication \nand treatment. If he believed he was bipolar he would seek the necessary treatment and \nfollow prescribed protocol. (Tr. 108-110) \nThe DOD requested that Applicant participate in a psychological evaluation by a \ngovernment-approved psychologist. In June 2021, he was evaluated by Dr. B. Applicant \ntestified that he had a 43-minute virtual meeting using the Zoom platform. Dr. B sent him \na computer link to complete a multiple choice test that took approximately an hour to \ncomplete. He described her as clinical and not open. He did not feel comfortable with her \nbecause of her demeanor, so he was not comfortable discussing private matters in his \nlife with her. She made no attempt to make him feel comfortable. Her questions were not \nopen ended, but rather required a yes or no answer, so that is the type of answer he \nprovided. He said he told Dr. B that J.A. had diagnosed him with bipolar disorder, but later \nR.J. did not agree with the diagnosis. He testified that Dr. B did not discuss bipolar \ndisorder with him. He said he was honest, but not open because of the way she conducted \nthe interview. He answered the questions she asked. He disputed several of the facts as \ninaccurate that Dr. B used in her evaluation. (Tr. 95-104)  \nDr. B noted that Applicant was cooperative but his answers were inconsistent with \nmedical documentation. She administered the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI). \nThe validity scales indicated considerable defensiveness. She said, \u201c[H]e appears \nmotivated to portray himself as being exceptionally free of common shortcomings to which \nmost individuals will admit.\u201d She believed due to this, his PAI clinical scale is unlikely to \nbe a valid reflection of his current level of functioning. She found his treatment motivation \nis a great deal lower than of typical individuals being seen in treatment settings.

She could not determine \nif he had type I or type II bipolar disorder. She noted he had been noncompliant with \ntreatment for both anxiety and bipolar disorder. She noted he was not forthcoming with \ninformation about his alcohol use, which suggested he is unlikely to be fully in recovery. \nShe noted his lack of candor. She believed he was at high risk of relapse for his alcohol \nuse disorder, as well as manic and/or depressive episodes. She believed he has been \ndishonest, making his trustworthiness questionable. She found he may not follow rules \nand regulations and had multiple conditions that could impact his conduct. She found he \ncould display poor judgment and reliability and that he was at risk for impulsive behavior. \nHis ability to safeguard classified information is likely to be compromised and his \nprognosis is poor. It does not appear she contacted Applicant\u2019s treating therapist or nurse \npractitioner or any of the others. (GE 5) \nOn February 10, 2023, Applicant was evaluated by Dr. C, a licensed psychologist. \nShe noted that she was privy to the SOR allegations and a reported diagnosis of bipolar \ndisorder, general anxiety disorder, and alcohol use disorder. She also noted that it was \nalleged that Applicant reportedly had been dishonest to Dr. B about his mental health \ntreatment and alcohol use that called into question his reliability, trustworthiness, and \ngood judgment. Dr. C conducted her examination through video-teleconference. Dr. C \nasked Applicant his perspective about the allegations in the SOR, and he indicated that \nit all started when he checked himself in for alcohol rehabilitation and it was required to \nbe reported to DOD. (Tr. 104; AE A) \nDr. C reviewed the SOR, documents from his counseling services, Dr. B\u2019s report, \nbehavioral recovery certificate, and miscellaneous records and letters from his previous \ntreatment providers. She also conducted a semi-structured clinical interview, \nobservations, administration of objective personality measure, PAI, and subjective report \nsymptoms via the Clinically Useful Depression Outcome scale, Post-traumatic Stress \nDisorder checklist, drug abuse screening test, mood disorder questionnaire, and alcohol \nuse disorder identification kit, among other tests. (AE A) \nDr. C noted that J.A. diagnosed Applicant with bipolar disorder in April 2018 but \nnoted that diagnostically it was unclear from the medical record why J.A. believed \nApplicant met the diagnostic criteria for bipolar as it does not appear he specifically \nendorsed symptoms of mania or hypomania. She noted, however, that Applicant did \nendorse excessive use of alcohol in June 2018 and that J.A. should have re-evaluated \nher diagnostic impression. Dr. C noted that Applicant saw J.A. monthly and reported \nconcerns of depression and alcohol misuse secondary to relationship distress until he \nself-referred to alcohol treatment in February 2019. (AE A) \nDr. C noted that Applicant reported he was coping with stress through alcohol and \nhe was becoming a person he did not want to be. He was drinking a fifth of vodka or more \ndaily. He reported his fianc\u00e9e broke up with him during treatment and he also lost friends \nwho took her side.

Applicant told Dr. C after he completed \nalcohol treatment, he wondered if he met the criteria for bipolar disorder and said he \nasked to be re-evaluated because he had discontinued use of alcohol. When he was \ntransferred to R.J. she re-evaluated him and diagnosed him with primary insomnia and \nalcohol use disorder in remission until May 2021. (AE A) \nDr. C noted that in June 2021, Applicant began treatment with M.B., and continues \nto see her monthly to this day. She has never diagnosed him with mood disorder but \ninstead with generalized anxiety disorder and sleep disorder. He is prescribed medication \nand has reportedly been compliant with all treatment sessions and medication. (AE A) \nDr. C also noted that Applicant sees J.B., a licensed clinical social worker. He has \nseen her biweekly since approximately September 2022 with care focused predominately \non increased anxiety in social interactions since COVID. Applicant reported that the \nmajority of his treatment is focused on what his social life will look like now that he is sober \nand trying not to be a hermit. (Tr. 107; AE A) \nApplicant disclosed to Dr. C that he has been sober since September 13, 2021, \nand that he relapsed twice when he tested the waters to see if he could control his \ndrinking. (AE A) \nDr. C specifically and thoroughly focused her clinical interview and questions about \nsymptoms of bipolar disorder. She stated: \u201cUpon further inquiry, it is possible that his \nprevious provider, [J.A.] misidentified his symptoms of substance use with those of \nhypomania and failed to appropriately reevaluate his symptom presentation upon his \nsobriety.\u201d (AE A page 5) \nDr. C had Applicant complete several psychological screeners. The results of the \ntests are as follows: \nClinically Useful Depressive Outcome Scale = 1, not suggestive of depression. \nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder-7 = 0, not suggestive of anxiety. \nPTSD Checklist for DSM-5 = 5, not suggestive of trauma disorder. \nAlcohol Use Disorders Identification Test = 2, suggestive of low risk alcohol \nconsumption at this time. \nDrug Abuse Screening Test-10 = 0, not suggestive of problematic drug use. \nMood Disorder Questionnaire = not indicative of a mood disorder diagnosis. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDr. C concluded: \nCollectively, [Applicant\u2019s] scores on these screeners reflect an individual \nwho is not experiencing significant symptoms of psychological distress at \nthis time but has had difficulties with alcohol misuse in the distant past. \nConsistent with self-report, [Applicant] endorsed a pronounced history of \nalcohol use since college but not understanding the true impact of alcohol \nuse on his functioning until approximately 2018. (AE A) \nDr. C was asked whether she agreed or disagreed with Dr. B\u2019s findings. She stated: \nIn general, as an objective third party to [Dr. B\u2019s] report, I found the \nevaluation to be lacking in thoroughness and objectivity given the gravity of \nthe circumstances for which the evaluation was conducted. This ultimately \ncasts doubt on the reliability and validity of the findings. [Dr. B] repeatedly \nrelied on historical data without providing context or an opportunity for \n[Applicant] to provide insight into the factors that contributed to conflicting \ninformation. (AE A) \nDr. C provided specific details of why she questioned Dr. B\u2019s findings. She \nspecially noted that Dr. B\u2019s diagnoses of bipolar disorder, unspecified; alcohol use \ndisorder, severe were primarily based on historical data with limited current behavioral \nexamples that would have helped to understand how she arrived at these diagnostic \nconclusions. Dr. C stated: \nThere was also no evidence that she conducted a contemporaneous, \nstructured or semi-structured review of bipolar disorder (to include \nhypomanic or manic) symptoms before labeling [Applicant] with this \ncondition that he denied having at the time of her evaluation. It appears [Dr. \nB] relied heavily on a combination of inaccurate historical medical data and \nthe results of the Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI), which was \nnotably lacking in elevations and specificity. (AE A page 7) \nDr. C concluded that in her opinion Dr. B\u2019s evaluation lacks rigor and specificity and \nshould not be used as a primary aid in making decisions about [Applicant\u2019s] security \nclearance eligibility. (AE A) \nDr. C diagnosed Applicant with Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Insomnia Disorder, \nand Alcohol Use Disorder, Moderate, in Sustained Remission. She did not find evidence \nto support a diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder II. She noted that Applicant has a history of \nsymptoms that could be misconstrued as hypomanic in the context of an active substance \nuse disorder. She noted his previous provider failed to adequately and appropriately \nreevaluate his symptom presentation based on his subsequent sobriety. She also noted \nthat Dr. B continued to fail to adequately evaluate [Applicant\u2019s] presentation during her \nevaluation, instead relying on erroneous historical data and PAI results that failed to \nprovide rationale for the diagnoses offered.

She found Applicant presently met the \ndiagnostic criteria for mental health conditions that are well controlled or currently in \nsustained remission. Although he meets the criteria for several mental health conditions, \nhe is receiving appropriate mental health care for these conditions and is actively \nengaged, receptive to multiple treatment modalities, and willing to implement \ninterventions offered by his treating providers. She found he does not currently have a \nmental health condition that could cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, \nor ability to safeguard sensitive or classified information or that would impair his reliability, \ntrustworthiness or judgment in protecting sensitive or classified information. (AE A page \n9) \nApplicant provided documentation of numerous awards and recognitions he has \nreceived throughout his life. He provided information about his education, certifications, \nand publications along with other professional accomplishments. (AE F, G, H) \nApplicant provided character letters. He is described as devoted, organized, \ndedicated, loyal, reliable, trustworthy, responsible, caring, charismatic, insightful, \nconfident, honest, and smart. He was repeatedly recommended to hold a security \nclearance. (AE I) \nPolicies  \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concerns for alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following to be potentially applicable: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving under the influence, \nfighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, \nregardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol use or whether the individual \nhas been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder;  \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, \nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol use disorder;  \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g. \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social worker) of \nalcohol use disorder; \n(e) failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant consumed alcohol infrequently from the age of 15 to 18 and then with \nvarying frequency, sometimes in excess to the point of intoxication, from age 1993 to \n2019. He was convicted of alcohol consumption as a minor in 1993. He was convicted of \nDUI in 1995 and again in 1999. As part of his 1999 DUI sentence, he attended outpatient \nalcohol treatment in 2000. He self-reported and admitted himself into an alcohol treatment \nprogram in 2019. He was aware he should abstain from future alcohol consumption. He \nrelapsed on two occasions. He was diagnosed by a government psychologist in June \n2021 with alcohol use disorder severe, among other diagnoses that will be discussed \nunder the psychological condition guideline. All of the above disqualifying conditions \napply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom alcohol consumption. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \n\u00b6 23: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol use, \nprovides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations;  \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has no \nprevious history of treatment or relapse, and is making satisfactory progress in a \ntreatment program; and  \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along with any \nrequired aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of \nmodified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant has not had an alcohol-related incident since 1999, almost 24 years ago. \nI find the three alcohol-related offenses are mitigated by time and future incidents are \nunlikely to recur due to Applicant\u2019s commitment to sobriety. \nIn 2019, Applicant decided that he had a problem with alcohol and later the same \nday he enrolled as inpatient in a treatment program. He readily admits he was in denial \nfor a period after his treatment about his ability to control his use of alcohol. After relapsing \ntwice, he accepted that he must totally abstain from alcohol consumption. It is not unusual \nfor those suffering from alcohol use disorder to stumble before coming to the conclusion \nthat they are powerless over their condition. It is likely that because of his relapses, he \nwas able to fully recognize that he cannot consume any alcohol and that he is an \nalcoholic. He is committed to his sobriety. He initially participated in AA and has \nparticipated in Smart Recovery since September 2021. He is participating in therapy with \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJ.B. to help him navigate his sobriety and relationships. I found Applicant credible that he \nintends to never consume alcohol again. All of the above mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern for psychological conditions is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative interference concerning the standards in this guideline may be \nraised solely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 28, and the following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may indicate an \nemotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not limited to, \nirresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, impulsive, \nchronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors; and \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the individual has \na condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness;  \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and  \n(d) failure to follow prescribed treatment plans related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, including but not limited to, failure to take prescribed \nmedication, or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \nThere is insufficient evidence that Applicant exhibited behavior as described in AG \n\u00b6 28(a). Applicant received counseling from Dr. T.S. from August 2107 to May 2018. SOR \n1.a alleges this treatment as a disqualifying condition. Receiving treatment or counseling \nis not a psychological disqualifying event. I find for Applicant on SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleged: \u201cThat information set forth in subparagraphs \u00b6\u00b6 2.e and 2.f.\u201d \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.e alleges: \u201cYou received alcohol abuse treatment at [BRC] from about \nFebruary 2019 to about March 2019. You were diagnosed with Alcohol Abuse Disorder \nand Bipolar II, and General Anxiety.\u201d \nSOR \u00b6 2.f alleges: \u201cYou received court mandated alcohol abuse treatment at [GLC] \nfrom about April 2000 to about September 2000.\u201d \nReceiving treatment is not a psychological disqualifying condition. The evidence \ndoes not support that Applicant received a diagnosis of Alcohol Use Disorder, Bipolar II, \nand General Anxiety Disorder by a duly qualified mental health professional while at this \ntreatment facility. The factual allegations were addressed under Guideline G. I find for \nApplicant for SOR \u00b6 1.b. \nThe evidence supports that Applicant was diagnosed by J.A., a nurse practitioner \nwith a psychiatric specialty, with bipolar disorder. I find there is insufficient evidence to \nconclude he refused to take his medication. He participated in his medicine management \nand may have questioned his practitioner, but I do not find the facts are sufficient to \nsupport this part of the allegation. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, unspecified, \ngeneralized anxiety disorder and alcohol use disorder, severe by Dr. B, a licensed \npsychologist employed by the government. AG \u00b6 28(b) applies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom psychological conditions. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29 were \nconsidered: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the individual \nhas demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the treatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program for a \ncondition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently receiving \ncounseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified mental \nhealth professional; and \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an individual\u2019s previous \ncondition is under control or in remission, and has a low probability of recurrence \nor exacerbation. \nApplicant was evaluated by Dr. B in June 2021. He was re-evaluated in February \n2023 by Dr. C. I have considered the timing and depth of both reports. The evidence \nsupports that Applicant was likely misdiagnosed by J.A. or should have minimally been \nre-evaluated after he participated in alcohol treatment. My analysis under Guideline G, \nalcohol consumption, also applies under the psychological issues that were raised \nregarding his alcohol use disorder diagnosis. I found Dr. C\u2019s prognosis based on \nApplicant\u2019s almost two years of sobriety and his active participation in AA and then Smart \nRecovery to be most probative. She opined that Applicant\u2019s prognosis was good and he \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndoes not currently have a mental health condition that could cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, judgment, or ability to safeguard sensitive or classified information or that \nwould impair his reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment in protecting sensitive or \nclassified information. Applicant has been actively participating in addressing any mental \nhealth issues for many years. He participated in treatment and has been compliant with \nhis medicine management. AG\u00b6\u00b6 29(a), 20(b), and 20(e) apply. \nDr. C was not a mental health professional approved by the government, so AG \u00b6 \n29(c) does not apply. However, I give great weight to her unbiased and professional \nopinion. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \nclearance investigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information.  \nThe SOR cross-alleges Dr. B\u2019s psychological evaluation and opinions alleged in \u00b6 \n1.d under the personal conduct guideline. There was no conduct alleged. Dr. B\u2019s \nevaluation was alleged under Guideline I, psychological conditions and addressed \naccordingly. I find for Applicant on SOR \u00b6 3.a. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines I, G, and E, in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant voluntarily admitted himself for alcohol treatment as an inpatient and \nthen participated in AA and Smart Recovery. Despite stumbling, he realized that he is an \nalcoholic and can never drink again. He has demonstrated an ongoing commitment to \nsobriety. Applicant sought advice and therapy for his mental health beginning in 2017. He \nhas seen multiple nurse practitioners and therapists to help him navigate his mental \nhealth. He did all of this voluntarily, recognizing he needed help. \nThe Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) specifically states: \nThe U.S. government recognizes the critical importance of mental health \nand advocates proactive management of mental health conditions to \nsupport the wellness and recovery of Federal employees and others. Every \nday individuals with mental health conditions carry out their duties without \npresenting a security risk. While most individuals with mental health \nconditions do not present security risks, there may be times when such a \ncondition can affect a person\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.  \nMental health treatment and counseling, in and of itself, is not a reason to \nrevoke or deny eligibility for access to classified information or for holding a \nsensitive position, suitability or fitness to obtain or retain Federal or contract \nemployment, or eligibility for physical or logical access to federally \ncontrolled facilities or information systems. Seeking or receiving mental \nhealth care for personal wellness and recovery may contribute favorably to \ndecisions about your eligibility. (GE 1) \nBeing an alcoholic does not prevent someone from holding a security clearance. \nApplicant is a success story in that he is recovering and continues to be a productive \nmember of society. His commitment to sobriety is evident. He has dealt with his mental \n16 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nhealth by seeking support and guidance from professionals.

For these reasons, I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline G, alcohol consumption Guideline \nI, psychological conditions, and Guideline E, personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCarol G.

After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been \nemployed with the defense contractor since 2019. Applicant has never held a security \nclearance. He is not married, and has no children. (TR at page 6 at line 21 to page 7 \nline 14, and GX 1 at pages 7, 13~14, 22~23 and 38~39.) \nGuideline I \u2013 Psychological Conditions & Guideline E - Personal Conduct \n1.a. and 4.a From about June of 2018 to about July of 2018, Applicant was \nhospitalized for Depression with suicidal ideation. He was diagnosed as suffering from a \nMajor \nDepressive \nDisorder \nand \nPolysubstance \nDependence \n\u2013 \nMDMA, \nMethamphetamines, Amphetamines, and Possibly Alcohol. (TR at page 33 line 18 to \npage 36 line 4, and GX 4.) \n1.b. and 4.a. In about August of 2020, Applicant was diagnosed as suffering from \na Bipolar 1 Disorder, Depressed Episode with Associated Features. (GX 5.) \n1.c. and 4.a. In May of 2021, Applicant was evaluated by a licensed psychologist. \nHe was diagnosed as suffering from an Unspecified Bipolar and Related Disorder, \nUnspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder, Unspecified \nAlcohol Related Disorder, and Stimulant Use Disorder, moderate, amphetamine type \nsubstance, in sustained remission. The psychologist further found that Applicant\u2019s \nmental health diagnoses may be a significant risk to Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability or \ntrustworthiness concerning classified information.

(TR at page 17 line 11 to page 20 line 13, \nand GX 7 at page 7.) \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct  \n4.a. has been discussed, above. \n4.b. In about November of 2011, Applicant was charged with and convicted of \nDriving Under the Influence of alcohol or drugs. He was placed on probation for ten \nyears. (GX 6.) \n4.c. Applicant failed to disclose his past marijuana, cocaine and MDMA use in \nanswer to \u201cSection 23 - Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity\u201d on his August 8, 2019 \nElectronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP). (TR at page 20 line 14 \nto page 23 line 8, and GX 1 at pages 35~36.) I find this to be a willful falsification. \n4.d. Applicant failed to disclose his past marijuana, cocaine and MDMA use in his \nResponse to Interrogatories on December 18, 2021. (TR at page 23 line 9 to page 24 \nline 23, and GX 2 at page 11.)  I find this to be a willful falsification. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline I \u2013 Psychological Conditions  \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Psychological Conditions is set \nforth at AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g. clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling.  \n \n \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 28 contains five conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions are established: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline \nand that may indicate an emotional, or personality condition, including, \nbut not limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                         \n \n                                                                                                                                          \n                                                                 \n                                                                                                                                                     \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre \nbehaviors; \n(b) opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual  has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness; and \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization.    \nAppellant was hospitalized in 2018, and diagnosed as suffering from a Major \nDepressive Disorder and Polysubstance Dependence \u2013 MDMA, Methamphetamines, \nAmphetamines, and Possibly Alcohol. In 2020, he was diagnosed as suffering from a \nBipolar 1 Disorder, Depressed Episode with Associated Features. More recently, in \n2021, he was diagnosed as suffering from an Unspecified Bipolar and Related Disorder, \nUnspecified Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorder, Unspecified \nAlcohol Related Disorder, and Stimulant Use Disorder, moderate, amphetamine type \nsubstance, in sustained remission. The psychologist further found that Applicant\u2019s \nmental health diagnoses may be a significant risk to Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability or \ntrustworthiness concerning classified information Therefore, AG \u00b6 28 is established. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 29 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Five conditions may be applicable: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controlled with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with \nthe treatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the \nindividual is currently receiving counseling or treatment with a \nfavorable prognosis by a duly qualified metal health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government that an \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has \na low probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows \nindications of emotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nNone of these apply. Psychological Conditions is found against Applicant. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Two conditions are established: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia.  \nAppellant used illegal substances from about 2006 until May of 2021. Therefore, \nAG \u00b6 25 (a), and (c) are established. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. One condition may be applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant\u2019s last usage of marijuana was in May of 2021, only a year prior to his \nhearing. It is too soon to find Applicant\u2019s 15 years of Drug Involvement and Substance \nMisuse is not of current security significance. Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nis found against Applicant. \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations \nApplicant has a significant past-due credit card debt. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing. He has not demonstrated that future \nfinancial problems are unlikely. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has not been established. \nFinancial Considerations is found against Applicant. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 \n15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative. \nApplicant falsified his 2019 e-QIP, and was not candid in his 2021 Response to \nInterrogatories. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 including: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully and; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nNone of these apply. Applicant was not candid with the Government as to his \nextensive, past drug abuse. Personal Conduct is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines I, H, F and E in my whole-person analysis. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

Her last timely payment was made in June 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.h). In March \n2020, the $1,620 delinquent balance due was placed for collection. Applicant made one \n$540 payment to the collection agency in November 2020, which reduced the delinquent \nbalance to $1,080 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Applicant said in her Answer that this debt would be paid \nin full on July 8, 2022. In her Response to the FORM, she said that she planned to begin \nmaking biweekly $154 payments toward this debt in February 2023, but the balance \nremained at $1,080 in the absence of any actual payments. This debt originated during \nher current employment and remains unresolved. (GE 2; GE 5; GE 7; AE A; AE B.) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c: These paragraphs allege Applicant\u2019s two current student loan\naccounts, under which all her formerly delinquent student loans were consolidated in June\n2017 (the same month she began her current employment). The last reported activity on\nthe consolidated accounts was in December 2018. They were placed for collection by the\nU.S. Department of Education in March 2020, with delinquent outstanding balances of \n$59,550 and $32,825. Applicant admitted owing the outstanding total of $92,375, toward \nwhich she has made no payments. Her December 2022 Transunion CBR confirmed that\nno payments had been received, but changed the status of these debts to, \u201cCurrent; Paid \nor Paying as Agreed.\u201d Since no explanation was provided, this could be due to the\ntemporary COVID-19 forbearance policy concerning collection of valid delinquent student\nloans. Applicant offered no evidence of responsible efforts to resolve or repay any of her \nvoluntarily incurred student loan debts, including the 15 delinquencies of concern when \nher clearance was denied in 2006.                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d through 1.g: Applicant admitted that she owes $26,657 toward four \ndelinquent debts that a credit union has charged off. Two of these involved $12,698 and \n$3,868 credit card accounts, which she opened in December 2011 and January 2012, \nand stopped paying in July and December 2015. The other two were unsecured loan \naccounts in the amounts of $2,116 and $7,975 that she opened in November and \nDecember 2013. She stopped repaying these loans in June and July 2015. She did not \nprovide evidence of any effort to resolve these accounts, which she opened while on \nactive duty and stopped paying shortly after her discharge. (GE 3; GE 5; GE 7; AE B.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.i: Applicant admitted the $99 delinquent debt to a franchise fitness center \nthat was placed for collection in February 2018. In December 2018, she told an OPM \ninvestigator that she broke her membership contract with the gym in June 2016 when she \nmoved after completing her bachelor\u2019s degree; and that she would pay it later that month. \nIn her Answer and her Response, she said that she had paid this debt. Although she \nprovided no documentation to support this claim, the debt does not appear on any of the \nrecord credit reports dated after April 2019. On balance I will accept her assertion that it \nis resolved. (GE3; GE 4; AE B.) \nThe record contains no evidence establishing Applicant\u2019s current income, budget \nsituation, or participation in financial counseling.

I was unable to evaluate \nher credibility, demeanor, or character in person, since she elected to have her case \ndecided without a hearing. \nPolicies \nThis national security eligibility action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG), which became effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified or sensitive information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as stated in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part:  \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes three conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant still owes seven of the SOR-alleged debts, totaling more than $120,000. \nThese debts became delinquent during the eight years since she left active duty in the \nNavy. Through her financial inability, unwillingness, or both, they remain unresolved. \nThese facts establish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and \nshift the burden to Applicant to mitigate the resulting security concerns. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s admitted financial delinquencies: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant failed to establish mitigation under any of these conditions. All but one \nof the eight delinquent debts of concern remain unresolved, demonstrating current \nunreliability and the likelihood of recurrent problems. Her initial security clearance \napplication was denied in 2006 due to her pre-service financial irresponsibility, which \nshows that her financial situation is not a recent development. She provided no evidence \nthat she obtained or is following professional counseling to establish financial \nresponsibility. There are no documented indications that the problem is being resolved or \nis under control. I accept her claim to have repaid her $99 fitness center debt, even though \nits absence from recent credit reports provides no evidence of actual resolution after all \nthis time. More than $120,000 of delinquent debt remains outstanding, creating ongoing \npotential for financial coercion and risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \na security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature and \naccountable ten-year Navy veteran who defaulted on more than $120,000 in voluntarily \nincurred debt. She repaid one $99 fitness center debt, but documented no attempt, \nworkable plan, or available resources to resolve her remaining delinquent debts since she \nbegan her current employment in June 2017. There remains significant potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress, which is likely to continue.

His admissions are incorporated \ninto the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 36 years old. He has never married. He has a 12-year-old son. He has \na high school diploma and some college credits. He has been employed in the defense \nindustry, with a clearance, since 2010. He has been in the same position but began \nworking under a new contract in December 2022. He earns an annual salary of about \n$100,000. (GE 1; Tr. 11, 51, 54-55 82) \nApplicant disclosed child support debt and an auto repossession on his SCA, and \nhe discussed those and other debts in his background interviews. (GE 1, GE 2) The debts \nare listed on CBRs from August 2020, September 2020, April 2021, and May 2022. (GE \n3 \u2013 GE 6) The Guideline F allegations in the SOR total about $69,546. The current status \nof his SOR debts is as follows: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($18,304) and 1.c ($15,128) are the same debt. SOR \u00b6 1.a is a \njudgment issued against Applicant in March 2021 by the creditor for SOR \u00b6 1.c. The \njudgment includes attorney\u2019s fees and interest. (GE 3, 4, 5, 7) Applicant admitted the debt \nin his Answer and said he was paying it. This debt relates to an auto loan that Applicant \ncosigned for Ms. R, the mother of his son. He believes she is responsible, so he is not \nmaking payments. They bought the car together several years ago. He began paying on \nthe debt in 2021 for about a year and a half at about $350 a month. He then gave the \nlender Ms. R\u2019s name for them to get payments from her. He said he now pays $120 per \nmonth but also said he is no longer making payments. The car was badly damaged in a \nfire.

(AE C) The balance may also \nhave been reduced by a garnishment from Applicant\u2019s pay, generally for about $330, \nreflected in his biweekly paystubs since about March 2022. (AE E) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b ($16,381) is an account placed for collection by a financial institution or \nlender. Applicant denied the debt and said it was no longer on his credit report. (GE 4, 5; \nTr. 58) He explained that this was a second car for which he co-signed with his girlfriend, \nbut he could not recall which car this debt related to. (GE 2; Tr. 61-62, 64-66) He provided \nno documents about this debt. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($2,323) is a debt placed for collection. (GE 4, 5) Applicant denied the \ndebt and said it was no longer on his credit report. At his hearing, he asserted it was paid. \nIt is a loan from many years ago. (Tr. 42-43) He provided no documents about this debt. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($603) is a bill placed for collection by a cable or internet company. (GE \n3, 4, 5) Applicant denied the debt, said it has been charged off, and is being disputed by \nthe debt relief company he retained in November 2021, as further discussed below. At \nhis hearing, he asserted that the debt had been paid. The bill resulted from a dispute over \nequipment he said he had returned several years ago, and he does not believe he owes \nanything. (Tr. 43-44) He provided no documents about this debt. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f ($278) is an account placed for collection by a power company. (GE 4, \n5) Applicant denied the debt and said it was no longer on his credit report. It is an unpaid \nor disputed power bill from a prior residence. He says it has been paid. (Tr. 45) He \nprovided no documents about this debt.  \nSOR \u00b6 1.g ($459) is an account that has been charged off by a financial services \ncompany. (GE 4, 5) This is a leasing or purchasing agreement for a TV set. Applicant \nsaid the debt has been paid. This is supported by a 2020 credit report. (Tr. 45, 76-78; GE \n6 at 7) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h ($11,294) is a charged-off auto debt. (GE 4, 5) Applicant denied the \ndebt and said it is being disputed by the debt relief company. He then acknowledged sole \nresponsibility for the car. He is no longer in possession of it. (Tr. 41, 62, 66-67) The debt \nis listed on a February 2023 credit report in charged-off status, with a balance of $12,296. \n(AE C) \nSOR \u00b6 1.i ($3,043) alleges past-due child support. (GE 5) Applicant admits the \ndebt and says he is paying. He pays $860 per month in child support for his child with Ms. \nR, and has done so for about four years. He has joint custody of his son. He wants to \nrestructure the child support requirement. He is unsure why there is, or was, a \ndelinquency in the payments. (Tr. 39, 51-53) Applicant provided pay stubs from 2020 to-\n2022, which show regular bi-weekly child support payments for about $341.53 taken out \nof his pay. (AE A) This would total about $683 a month, not $860.

He acknowledged there was \u201ca hole in the wall and \nstuff like that\u201d when he left, so they kept the security deposit. (Tr. 46-47) He provided no \ndocuments about this debt.  \nSOR \u00b6 1.k ($566) is a debt to an unidentified medical creditor, an account that has \nbeen placed for collection. (GE 5) Applicant denied the debt and said it was no longer on \nhis credit report. This was from an ER visit from about three years ago when he did not \nprovide his insurance card. He said it was paid by insurance. (Tr. 47) The debt is listed \non a February 2023 credit report in collection status, with a balance of $570. (AE C) \nSOR \u00b6 1.l ($393) is an account that has been charged off by a large department \nstore. (GE 5) Applicant denied the debt and said it was no longer on his credit report. He \ntook out an account and had a small bill, which he said he paid. He could not explain the \norigin of the $393 debt and does not recall if it has been paid or resolved. (Tr. 48) He \nprovided no documents about this debt. \nApplicant first contacted debt relief company W in 2018 to assist in fixing his credit \nbut did not formally retain them until November 2021. He was paying them $300 a month \nbut is no longer paying them. (Tr. 85-86, 88; AE B) He asserted that they had removed \nall of the SOR debts from his credit report but for SOR \u00b6 1.b and the child support debt at \nSOR \u00b6 1.i, both of which he was paying. He was unable to provide the basis for which the \nother debts had been removed from his CBR. He noted that many of the debts are several \nyears old and he took steps to have them removed from his credit report. (Tr. 36-40, 49-\n50 68-70, 78) AE B does not show that company W took any steps to challenge or resolve \nany particular debt, alleged or otherwise.  \nAE D concerns the payments for Applicant\u2019s current car, a 2020 domestic sedan. \nHe said he bought the car in 2020 for $15,000. He is current on his payments. (Tr. 71) \nThe account is also listed on a February 2023 CBR. According to both AE C and AE D, \nhe is current on his monthly payments (of about $560) but owes about $24,200. \nApplicant receives about $2,600 biweekly after taxes. Expenses listed are about \nthe same. (Tr. 72-75) He acknowledged that he owes $2,000 to $3,000 in past-due \nincome taxes from 2012 to 2014 because of a tax preparer\u2019s error. He is resolving this \nthrough a tax relief service. He has no unfiled tax returns. (Tr. 79-82) The debt relief \nservice offered him some credit counseling about minding his spending and being more \naware of his credit. (Tr. 86-87) \nApplicant testified that his financial problems were due to immaturity, financial \ninexperience, and being overly generous. His son\u2019s mother was also not working at the \ntime, and he had to assume financial responsibility for her and their son. His mother also \npassed away in 2018, which caused hardship. He said he has learned the error of his \nways and will work to improve in the future. (Tr. 96-100) A February 2023 credit report \nshows a credit score of 563, and a \u201cpoor\u201d credit rating.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction\nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of several variables known as the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. The\nprotection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that\n\u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified information\nwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have drawn\nonly those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained\nin the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation\nor conjecture. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out, \nin relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe Guideline F allegations in the SOR concern multiple debts, including \nconsumer debts and several auto repossessions. The SOR debts are established by \ncredit reports in the record and by Applicant\u2019s testimony. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the\nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit\ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control;  \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant became significantly over-extended financially when he was younger. \nHe cosigned on two cars with the mother of his son, and bought another car for himself. \nAll three of those cars led to repossessions, and none are resolved. He has other \nconsumer debts, and past-due debts from household expenses like rent, utilities, and \ncable. His financial issues have continued for several years and are ongoing. The fact \nthat several of Applicant\u2019s debts are old enough to have dropped off his credit report or \nbecame charged off does not mean he is no longer responsible for them. His financial \nissues are not isolated and continue to cast doubt on his current judgment, \ntrustworthiness, and reliability. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. Applicant experienced some financial hardship after \nhis mother passed away, and the employment status of his son\u2019s mother is unclear, but \nhe has been gainfully employed since about 2010 and makes a good living. He also \nacknowledged that his financial problems are due to his own immaturity and inexperience, \nrather than an outside cause. \nApplicant has pursued some credit counseling through the debt relief company, \nbut he has not provided sufficient evidence that his debts are being resolved or are under \ncontrol. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) has little application. He is paying on his child support obligation and \nappears to be paying or resolving SOR \u00b6 1.a, for which he now owes less than alleged. \nBut he has taken little to no other action to pay, resolve, or settle his other debts. He did \nnot provide enough evidence to support a finding that he has made a good-faith effort to \nrectify his financial issues. To do that, he needs to establish more of a track record of \nsteady payments towards his debts. \nApplicant disputed most of his debts, asserting that they were either resolved by \nthe debt relief company or because they were charged off and had fallen off his credit \nreport. Neither claim is sufficient to establish that he is no longer responsible for those \ndebts. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant has a history of financial instability, \ngoing back to his younger days. Applicant\u2019s debts will remain a security concern until he \nshows a documented track record of good-faith efforts to resolve them. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:   \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:   \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:   \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:   \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nSubparagraphs 1.j-1.l:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

He was permitted to resign in lieu of being fired. (Tr.1 at 39-40; \nTr.2 at 10-12; GE 1) \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including child support arrearages, \ndelinquent debts, and unpaid taxes. He filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case in about \nNovember 2014. (SOR \u00b6 2.a) The case was dismissed in 2015. (Tr.1 at 35, 41-42; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3, 4) \nApplicant admitted for the first time during his hearing in December 2022 that he \nowed the IRS about $23,000 in unpaid taxes. (SOR \u00b6 2.k) He stated that the IRS started \ngarnishing his wages $1,600 per month in October 2022. He stated that the problem \nwent back about three to four years and occurred because he and his ex-wife both \nclaimed their three children as exemptions. He retained a tax attorney to assist him. The \namount of about $23,000 and the $1,600 per month garnishment were worked out \nbetween his attorney and the IRS. He stated that he planned to pay his back taxes \nwithin a month. (Tr.1 at 58-68) \nApplicant testified during the second hearing that he paid the back taxes. He \nstated that he made a lump-sum payment after the first hearing. He did not provide \nproof of the payment nor any documents from the IRS, but he submitted an account \noverview from his attorney that may have been derived from IRS tax account \ntranscripts. The overview does not show that Applicant currently owes the IRS. It does \nshow that federal income tax returns were not filed in 2009, 2013, 2015, or 2016.1 It \nalso showed that the 2017 federal return was not filed until January 2022, and the 2018 \nfederal return was not filed until July 2021. Applicant testified that he filed his federal \nreturns on time, and that the document was incorrect. (Tr.2 at 22-24; AE G) \nApplicant had child support arrearages. The March 2020 combined credit report \nshowed past-due accounts with balances of $22,554 (SOR \u00b6 2.b) reported by Equifax \nand Experian, and $6,949 (SOR \u00b6 2.c) reported by Equifax. The May 2021 Experian \ncredit report shows the first account with a balance of $22,289. The second account is \nnot listed on that report. Applicant stated that he is current on his child support for all his \nchildren. He provided documentation showing he was current on the $22,554 account \nas of January 2023. The $6,949 account had been reduced to $151 as of January 2023. \n(Tr.1 at 41-44; AE D) \nApplicant was the cosigner on a vehicle that was repossessed in 2014 or 2015. \nThe credit reports show that the creditor charged off $9,117 in September 2015. The \nbalance is listed as $13,378 (SOR \u00b6 2.d). He stated that he thought the account was \nresolved when the vehicle was auctioned. He has not made any payments toward the \ndeficiency balance. (Tr.1 at 44-45) \n1 The SOR did not allege that Applicant failed to file his federal income tax returns. Any matter that was \nnot alleged in the SOR cannot be used for disqualification purposes. It may be considered in assessing \nApplicant\u2019s credibility, in the application of mitigating conditions, and in the whole-person analysis. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.h alleges a $196 utilities debt.

He has two 2022 vehicles for which he pays about $815 and $650 \nper month. He stated in the first hearing that he had almost $30,000 in the bank. His \nbank statement showed that he had $2,212 in his checking account and $23,014 in his \nsavings account. (Tr.1 at 51-58; AE C) \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nMarch 2020. There were several things not reported, such as some of his employment, \nhis children, his 2013 arrest and charge of criminal injury to a child, his 2014 Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy case, his 2019 counseling and resignation in lieu of termination, and his \nunpaid taxes. Applicant denied intentionally providing false information under all the \nquestions, except the question about unpaid taxes. He admitted that he intentionally did \nnot report his unpaid taxes because he thought he would lose his job if he reported \nthem.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process.

According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including a Chapter 13 bankruptcy \ncase, delinquent debts, child support arrearages, and unpaid taxes. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), \nand 19(f) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s Chapter 13 bankruptcy case was dismissed in about 2015 (SOR \u00b6 \n2.a). He is current on his child support (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c). He documented that he \npaid the $196 and $190 utilities debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.h and 2.i). He stated that he paid the \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.e, 2.f, and 2.g. None of those debts are listed on his most \nrecent credit report. All the allegations in this paragraph are mitigated. \nApplicant stated that he paid the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.j, but he did not submit \nsupporting documentation. The Appeal Board has held that \u201cit is reasonable for a Judge \nto expect applicants to present documentation about the satisfaction of specific debts.\u201d \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-07091 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 11, 2010) (quoting ISCR Case No. \n04-10671 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2006)). It is Applicant\u2019s burden to mitigate established \nfacts. He has not established that this debt has been paid. There is no evidence that \npayments have been made on the $13,378 debt for a repossessed vehicle (SOR \u00b6 2.d). \nThese debts are not mitigated. \nApplicant admitted for the first time during his hearing in December 2022 that he \nowed the IRS about $23,000 in unpaid taxes. He stated during the second hearing that \nhe paid the taxes, first by garnishment, starting in October 2022, and then by a lump-\nsum payment in between the two hearings. An applicant who begins to resolve security \nconcerns only after having been placed on notice that his or her clearance is in jeopardy \nmay lack the judgment and willingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her \npersonal interests are not threatened. See ISCR Case No. 17-03229 at 6 (App. Bd. Jun. \n7, 2019). \nApplicant did not submit documentation from the IRS. but he submitted an \naccount overview from his attorney that may have been derived from IRS tax account \ntranscripts. Applicant wants me to accept the document as proof that he paid his taxes, \nbut disregard that the document shows that he did not file federal income tax returns in \n2009, 2013, 2015, and 2016. I accept that the taxes have been paid, but I also accept \nthat he did not file tax returns in 2009, 2013, 2015, and 2016. AG \u00b6 20(g) is applicable \nto the paid taxes, but that does not end the discussion. \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill \nhis or her legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does \nnot demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those \ngranted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 16, 2018). This is true even when the taxes are eventually paid. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to fulfil his duty to file his income tax returns and pay his taxes \non time continues to raise doubts about his judgment, reliability, and willingness to \nfollow rules and regulations. The mitigation provided by the paid taxes is insufficient to \novercome the years of Applicant shirking his responsibility to file his tax returns and pay \nhis taxes.

Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \nclearance investigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other\nemployer\u2019s time or resources; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges that Applicant resigned in lieu of termination in 2019 for \nmultiple write ups. The only evidence in the record is that Applicant was involved in two \ntraffic accidents after a blow out and when he swerved to miss a deer. His company \nmay have been justified in letting him go even if the accidents were not his fault, but two \naccidents, without any additional evidence, are not enough to raise a personal conduct \nsecurity concern. SOR \u00b6 1.f is concluded for Applicant. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges that Applicant was terminated from his employment because \nhis security clearance was denied. There is no evidence that Applicant was \u201cdenied\u201d a \nsecurity clearance. Even if Applicant had been denied a security clearance, that is not \nenough to raise independent personal conduct security concerns. Individuals are denied \nsecurity clearances all the time for matters that have absolutely nothing to do with \npersonal conduct. SOR \u00b6 1.g is concluded for Applicant. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d allege that Applicant falsified the March 2020 SF 86 \nwhen he failed to report his 2015 and 2019 terminations (SOR \u00b6 1.a), his November \n2013 arrest (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and his 2014 Chapter 13 bankruptcy case (SOR \u00b6 1.d). \nApplicant credibly denied intentionally falsifying these questions. I find that there is \ninsufficient evidence to determine that he intentionally falsified these questions. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a, 1.b, and 1.d are concluded for Applicant. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that Applicant falsified the March 2020 SF 86 when he failed \nto report that his security clearance was \u201cdenied\u201d in 2015. There is no evidence that his \nclearance was denied. SOR \u00b6 1.c is concluded for Applicant. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges that Applicant falsified the March 2020 SF 86 when he failed \nto report his financial issues under the following specific questions: \nIn the past seven (7) years, [have] you had bills or debts turned over to a \ncollection agency? [and] In the past seven (7) years, [have] you had any \naccount or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to \npay as agreed? (Include financial obligations for which you were the sole \ndebtor, as well as those for which you were a cosigner or guarantor). \nTo prove this allegation, the Government must prove by substantial evidence, \namong other things, that Applicant knew that he \u201chad bills or debts turned over to a \ncollection agency\u201d or that he knew that he \u201chad any account or credit card suspended, \ncharged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed.\u201d That knowledge has not been \nestablished. There is insufficient evidence that Applicant intentionally falsified the \nspecific questions alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e, and that allegation is concluded for Applicant. \nApplicant intentionally provided false information on the March 2020 SF 86 when \nhe failed to report his unpaid federal taxes. AG \u00b6 16(a) is applicable. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns.

Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant did not report his unpaid federal taxes until he was specifically asked \nabout his taxes during the first hearing in December 2022. None of the mitigating \nconditions are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \ncomments under Guidelines E and F in my whole-person analysis.

I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the personal conduct and financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.i: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j-1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

Williams, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n03/24/2023 \nDecision \nGARCIA, Candace Le\u2019i, Administrative Judge: \nApplicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 20, 2021, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) \nimplemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR (Answer) on January 12, 2022, and he requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on October 11, 2022, scheduling the matter for a video \nteleconference hearing on November 14, 2022. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nAt the hearing, I admitted Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4 without objection. \nApplicant testified but did not submit documentation or call witnesses. At Applicant\u2019s \nrequest, I left the record open until December 12, 2022, for him to submit documentation. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant timely submitted documentation, which I collectively marked as AE A and \nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on November 28, \n2022. \nSOR Amendment \nAt the hearing, Applicant stated that he does not have a middle name. As such, I \nsua sponte amended the caption of the SOR, pursuant to \u00b6 E3.1.17 of the Directive, to \nstrike the middle initial \u201cN.\u201d \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant denied all the SOR allegations. He is 56 years old. He married in 1987, \nseparated in 2017, divorced in 2018, and remarried in 2019. He has two adult children, a \nson and a daughter. He earned an associate degree in 1988 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in \n1997. He has worked for various DOD contractors, both in the United States and \noverseas, since 2010, except for periods of unemployment from December 2011 to April \n2012 and January 2014 to August 2014. He has lived and worked overseas as a system \nadministrator for his employer who is a DOD contractor, since 2017. He and his ex-\nspouse have co-owned a home in the United States since 1996, and she resides in the \nhome. He has never held a security clearance. (Answer; Tr. at 28; GE 1-2) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant has a $54,203 charged-off student loan. (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a) It also alleged that he failed to file, as required, his federal and state income tax\nreturns for tax years (TY) 2019 and 2020. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.c) Applicant\u2019s delinquent student\nloan is listed on credit bureau reports from September 2020 and April 2021, and he\ndiscussed it during his January 2021 interview with a background investigator. He\nreported his failure to timely file his relevant income tax returns in his November 2021\nresponse to interrogatories. (Tr. at 18-; GE 2-4) \n \n \n \n \n \nIn approximately 2011, Applicant co-signed with his daughter the student loan at \nissue, with the understanding that she would be responsible for repaying it. When she \ngraduated from college, she told him that she was repaying the student loan through a \nrepayment plan. He was unaware that the student loan was delinquent until he began to \nreceive email correspondence from the creditor in approximately 2019. He then contacted \nhis daughter and reiterated to her that the loan was her responsibility. He also told her to \ncommunicate with the creditor to request a forbearance, since she was unemployed at \nthat time. She told him that she would, and she also informed him that the creditor \npermitted her to remove him as a co-signer from the loan. (Tr. at 18-25, 31-32, 34-45; GE \n2-4; AE A) \nDocumentation from the creditor reflects that in September 2019: the creditor \ninformed Applicant\u2019s daughter that she was solely responsible for the loan; the creditor \nreleased the cosigner from all future responsibility for repayment of the loan; Applicant\u2019s \ndaughter was solely responsible for repaying the loan; and the outstanding balance was \n$41,753. Applicant relied on this information and believed he was no longer responsible \nfor his daughter\u2019s student loan. He disputed the student loan with the three major credit \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbureaus. The December 2022 credit bureau reports reflect that his disputes were \nsuccessful, and the credit bureaus deleted the loan from his credit reports. (Tr. at 18-25, \n31-32, 34-45; GE 2-4; AE A) \nApplicant attributed his failure to timely file his relevant federal and state income \ntax returns to his move overseas in 2017, his inability to locate documents necessary for \nfiling those returns, and his misunderstanding after speaking with an IRS representative \nthat he was able to file his federal income tax returns every three years so long as he did \nnot owe taxes. His tax accountant filed these income tax returns between January and \nFebruary 2022. He timely filed his income tax returns for TY 2021 and 2022, and he did \nnot owe taxes. He understood that he was legally required to file his federal and state \nincome tax returns annually, and he expected to file his future income tax returns \naccordingly. (Answer; Tr. at 25-27, 32-33, 46-51) \nAs of the date of the hearing, Applicant earned $130,000 annually, or \napproximately $9,000 monthly. He also received $500 monthly in rental property income. \nHis spouse owned their residence, but he contributed to the household expenses. His \nestimated monthly net remainder, after expenses, was approximately $3,000 to $5,000. \nHe had approximately $22,000 in his savings account and $175,000 in his retirement \nsavings accounts. He received financial counseling in approximately 2008. He does not \nhave any other delinquent debts. (Tr. at 27-34, 36, 45-46; GE 3-4; AE A) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nApplicant has a history of not paying a student loan for which he cosigned with his \ndaughter. He also failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for TY 2019 \nand 2020, as required. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f). \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due \ndebt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve \nthe issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to the delinquent student loan \nthat Applicant cosigned with his daughter. The first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the \nfull application of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that he acted responsibly under \nhis circumstances. Before he received the SOR he consulted with his daughter in 2019 \nwhen he began to receive email correspondence from the student loan creditor, and he \nrelied on her indication to him that the creditor permitted her to remove him as a cosigner \nfrom the student loan. December 2022 credit bureau reports reflect that he successfully \ndisputed the student loan with the three major credit bureaus, and the loan was deleted \nfrom his credit reports. \nApplicant filed his federal and state income tax returns for TY 2019 and 2020 in \nearly 2022. He also timely filed his income tax returns for TY 2021 and 2022, and he did \nnot owe taxes. He understood that he was legally required to file his federal and state \nincome tax returns annually, and he expected to file his future income tax returns \naccordingly. He received financial counseling in approximately 2008. He does not have \nany other delinquent debts. His finances are under control, and they do not continue to \ncast doubt on his judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. I find that \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), \n20(c), 20(d), 20(e) and 20(g) are established. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201c[a]ny determination \nunder this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concerns pertaining to alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: Three potentially apply: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional (e.g., \nphysician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder; and \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant was arrested and charged with DUI in 2007, 2009, and in 2014. He was \nlegally intoxicated and impaired at the time of his arrests for DUI. He was subsequently \nconvicted of each DUI. In 2008, he was arrested and convicted for an alcohol-related \noffense. The evidence establishes disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c). \nIn April 2013, Applicant entered a six-month alcohol treatment program. The record does \nnot contain records from that program documenting a diagnosis of an alcohol use disorder \nby a qualified medical or mental health professional. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(d) and 22(f) do not apply. \nApplicant admitted that the person who evaluated him during the program, recommended \nthat he abstain from alcohol. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23 provides four conditions that could provide mitigation of the alcohol \nconsumption security concerns: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations;  \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant was arrested for alcohol-related offenses in 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2014. \nHe was released from the probation that was imposed for his 2014 DUI in June 2019. \nFrom 2014 to 2019, he has been involved in the legal system as a consequence of \nconsuming too much alcohol on more than one occasion. Although some time has passed \nsince his 2014 DUI, the circumstances underlying his legal problems were not so unusual \nthat they are unlikely to recur. The evidence establishes partial mitigation under AG \u00b6 \n23(a). \nApplicant has not acknowledged that he has an alcohol problem, and he continues \nto consume alcohol with regularity despite being advised during his treatment in 2013 to \nabstain. He is not participating in treatment or attending AA. Despite his assertions that \nhe no longer consumes alcohol and drives, there is insufficient evidence from credible \nsources to verify that alcohol no longer presents a problem for him. Accordingly, he failed \nto establish mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 23 (b), 23(c) and 23(d). \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 sets out the security concern related to criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 lists two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \npotentially disqualifying in this case: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant was arrested and convicted four times between 2007 and 2018. He was \non probation from September 2008 to September 2009, April 2013 to April 2014, and \nJune 2018 to June 2019. He was found guilty of probation violations twice in 2019. These \nmultiple incidents raise questions about his judgment and trustworthiness. The evidence \nestablishes the above disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 32 describes conditions that could mitigate the security concerns raised \nunder this guideline. One could apply: \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant has not been arrested since November 2014. In January and April 2019, \nhe pleaded guilty to violating probation and served two days in jail each time. In June \n2019, he was released from the probation that was imposed in June 2018 for the 2014 \nDUI. Other than his release from probation and the passage of time from 2019 without \nrecurrence of criminal activity, there is no other evidence of successful rehabilitation. The \nevidence establishes some mitigation under AG \u00b6 32(d), but is insufficient to fully mitigate \nthe security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \na security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature person \nwho is accountable for his choices and actions. He has a history of failing to comply with \nthe law, rules, and regulations, as demonstrated by his past alcohol-related criminal \nconduct. He repeatedly violated the law, violated probation, and failed to appear in court \nas was ordered. There is insufficient evidence to establish permanent behavioral changes \nin Applicant\u2019s consumption of alcohol and compliance with the law, so I cannot conclude \nthat similar conduct is unlikely to recur. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nsubstantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. He did not meet his burden to mitigate the security concerns arising under the \ncriminal conduct and alcohol consumption guidelines. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nConsidering the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

The \ncase was assigned to me on April 18, 2023. On May 4, 2023, DOHA issued a notice \nscheduling the hearing for June 5, 2023, with the hearing to occur via video-\nteleconference through an online platform. \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 7. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AE) A through C. All exhibits were admitted without objection. At the end of the \nhearing, I held the record open until June 20, 2023, to enable Applicant the opportunity \nto submit additional information. He subsequently submitted three credit reports, which \nare marked as AE D, AE E, and AE F, and admitted without objection. DOHA received \nthe hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 14, 2023. The record closed on June 20, 2023. \nFindings of Fact  \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 3.d, 3.e, 3.f, and \nthe cross-allegation at SOR \u00b6 2.a, all with explanations. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 3.a, 3.b, \nand 3.c, all with explanations. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated into the findings \nof fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 34 years old. He married in 2013. He and his wife separated in 2019 \nand divorced in 2020. They have three children, a son, age 13, a daughter, age 8, and a \nson, age 7. They share custody of their children and live in the same neighborhood. (GE \n1; Tr. 59-62, 68) \nApplicant earned an associate degree in 2010. He served on active duty in the \nU.S. Navy as a corpsman and psychiatric technician from 2010 to 2015. He was \ndischarged honorably as an E-3. From October 2015 to October 2017, he worked as a \nmental health technician at a civilian hospital in state 1. Since October 2017, he has \nbeen employed by a defense contractor as a mental health technician in an inpatient \npsychiatric unit at a naval hospital in state 2. He held a clearance in the Navy. (GE 1; Tr. \n9-10, 35-36, 46-50, 58, 112-114) \nIn 2014, Applicant took the cellphone of another sailor without her permission. He \n\u201cflipped\u201d through pictures on her phone.

He pled guilty, received non-judicial punishment (NJP) \nof 45 days of extra duty. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) (The SOR allegation references forfeiture of $858 \na month for two months but this is not established). Applicant was also transferred to \nanother job location so he would no longer have contact with the female sailor. (GE 1 at \n20; GE 2 at 2-3; Tr. 51) In his hearing, Applicant testified it was a \u201cjuvenile prank that \nwas very stupid.\u201d He said he gave the phone right back and did not steal it. (Tr. 33-34, \n75-79) \nIn 2015, Applicant was investigated by the Naval Criminal Investigative Service \n(NCIS) following an interaction between himself and a female former patient. About a \nyear after the female sailor was a patient of his, he saw her at a public library and \nengaged her in conversation. She later alleged that he had been \u201chitting on\u201d her. His \nbackground interview references a charge of sexual assault under UCMJ Article 120 \n(GE 2 at 3) but there are no charging documents in the record. Applicant asserted that \nhe did not do anything inappropriate in interacting with his former patient. (Tr. 52) The \ncase was evidently dismissed shortly before Applicant was discharged from the Navy. \n(GE 2 at 3; Tr. 51-55). This incident was not alleged in the SOR. \nWhile working at the behavioral hospital in state 1 in 2016, Applicant was verbally \nreprimanded after giving his personal phone number to a female patient. He said he did \nthis unprompted so the patient would have a way to reach out if she needed help, \nbecause he felt that she \u201cdid not have adequate support.\u201d He denied any romantic \ninterest. (GE 2 at 4; Tr. 55-56) He had not done this before. He had been trained in how \nto interact with patients and said what he did was \u201cnot encouraged.\u201d (Tr. 56) This \nincident was not alleged in the SOR. \nIn early July 2020, police responded to a complaint filed by a neighbor (Ms. N) of \nApplicant\u2019s, after she found inappropriate messages and photos on the cell phone of C, \nher 12-year-old daughter. C had been communicating with Applicant online, via \nFacebook Messenger, in June and July 2020. The N family and their children were \nfriends of Applicant\u2019s children. In August 2020, following an investigation, Applicant was \narrested and charged with (taking) indecent liberties with a child, a felony. (GE 3) (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 2.a) \nApplicant was interviewed about his arrest in a security clearance background \ninterview on September 1, 2020. (GE 2 at 7-10) (An earlier background interview, in late \nJuly 2020, predated Applicant\u2019s arrest). (GE 2 at 2-6; Tr. 72-73, 100) \nWhen prompted at the start of his September 2020 interview. Applicant reported \nthat he had been accused of taking indecent liberties with a child. He said his wife had\nhad a \u201cfalling out\u201d with her friend Ms. N (the neighbor) and had accused both Applicant\nand his wife of indecent liberties with her children. The families and their children had\nbeen friends and the families\u2019 daughters would socialize together. Applicant tried to look\nafter N\u2019s daughters because they did not have a father figure.

He said C had sent him \n\u201cpictures of herself, to show him her outfit, and [Applicant] referred to [C] as \u2018sexy.\u2019\u201d He \nsaid he should have used words like \u201cbeautiful\u201d instead, and was \u201cjust trying to look out \nfor her by boosting her self-esteem.\u201d He acknowledged his words were \u201cinappropriate.\u201d \n(GE 2 at 7-8; Tr. 66-67, 69-70) \nApplicant then said C volunteered to send him another picture.

Applicant did not tell his wife \nabout the photo \u201cbecause he did not want to violate [C\u2019s] trust by getting her into \ntrouble. [Applicant] continued to have daily contact with [C] after she sent him the \nphoto.\u201d He said there was nothing further sexual and no sexual gratification on his part. \n(GE 2 at 8; Tr, 69-70) \nC\u2019s family member discovered the photo on C\u2019s phone and contacted Applicant \nthrough C\u2019s Facebook account.

He was arrested a \nfew weeks later. (GE 2 at 8; Tr. 70-71) Applicant said that, as a father, he would be \n\u201cconcerned\u201d if his child were interacting with a 30-year-old man on a cell phone. (Tr. 70) \nApplicant said in the interview that he believed Ms. M was coaching C to make \nthese accusations. He has only been with C in person in the presence of Ms. M or his \nwife, except once, when he and C were seated on the couch together for about 20 \nminutes. He said he believed Ms. M might claim that Applicant tried to kiss C, which he \ndenied. He said other children were present and playing in the house at the time. (GE 2 \nat 8-9) He got no sexual gratification from any interaction with C. Applicant said in his \ninterview that the criminal case was pending, he had retained counsel, and said he was \ninnocent.

He said it was she who sent sexual materials to him. He \nacknowledged that he should not have been talking to her in the first place. (Tr. 39) He \ndid not recall how he came to have C\u2019s cell phone number. \u201cI assume she just gave it to \nme.\u201d He said they interacted on Facebook, not by cell-phone texting. He asserted that C \nfound him on Facebook and added him as a contact. (Tr. 41) Applicant said C would \nsend her pictures and ask her his opinion and said that one time she sent him a sexual \npicture, which he deleted at once and told her that was inappropriate.

(Tr. 37-38) He said in his Answer that it was \na false claim brought by his ex-wife with no basis in fact. (Answer to SOR \u00b6 2.b; Tr. 98) \nApplicant provided a January 2022 letter from county DSS regarding their \ninvestigation of April 2021 allegations of \u201csexual abuse and neglect, improper care \nimproper supervision, and injurious involvement.\u201d In June 2021, Applicant\u2019s family was \nfound to be in need of parenting skills, child characteristics, and communications skills. \nApplicant and his former wife completed a \u201cCrossroads of Parenting and Divorce\u201d \nprogram and other classes, and the DSS case was closed.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.

This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis  \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct:  \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern for criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \nIn August 2020, Applicant was arrested and charged with taking indecent \nliberties with a child.

AG \u00b6 31(b) applies to both SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. \nAG \u00b6 31(c) (individual is currently on parole or probation) does not apply, since \nApplicant\u2019s two years of probation ended in March 2023, shortly before the hearing. \nAG \u00b6 32 sets forth the potentially applicable mitigating conditions: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and  \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nThe 2014 incident in which Applicant received NJP after he took another sailor\u2019s \ncellphone without her permission is mitigated by the passage of time. His more recent \ncriminal conduct, involving C, a minor child, is not. Applicant, then a married adult male \nin his early 30s. exercised extremely poor judgment in his relationship and daily \ninteractions with C, a 12-year-old neighbor and friend of his daughters. In June and July \n2020, he engaged with C on a daily basis over Facebook, purportedly out of an interest \nin her well-being. She began sending him photos and asking him her opinion of her \nphysical appearance. He said she looked \u201cbeautiful,\u201d even \u201csexy.\u201d She sent him a naked \nphotograph of herself. He told her not to do it again, but did not report the matter, either \nto his wife, or to the girl\u2019s mother, whom he knew. Once the photos were discovered by \nC\u2019s family members, Applicant was charged with felony indecent liberties with a child, \nand he later pled guilty to a lesser offense of contributing to the delinquency of a \njuvenile. He successfully completed two years of probation, but only recently, in March \n2023. Applicant\u2019s interactions with C also occurred recently, only three years ago, He \nengaged in this conduct while his current security clearance application was pending \nadjudication (indeed, he had just completed it), a time when he might be expected to be \nparticularly mindful of the importance of exercising good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 32(d) has some application, as Applicant successfully completed probation \nin March 2023. But his conduct is too recent, and too serious, to be considered fully \nmitigated. Further, Applicant has also engaged in a pattern of conduct (some alleged, \nand some not) in which he wrongly asserted a parental or mentor-like responsibility for \nvulnerable females, including a patient and a minor child. AG \u00b6 32(a) is not applicable. \nHe did not show that his conduct occurred under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment. Applicant did not mitigate security concerns about his established criminal \nconduct. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior \nAG \u00b6 12 expresses the security concern for sexual conduct: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and \n \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a is a cross-allegation of SOR \u00b6 1.a, Applicant\u2019s August 2020 arrest \ndiscussed above. Applicant was charged with taking indecent liberties with a child after \nC, a 12-year-old neighbor, sent photos wearing outfits in which he said she looked \n\u201csexy,\u201d and later sent him a naked photo of herself on Facebook. He pled guilty to \ncontributing to the delinquency of a minor, a lesser offense. It is not established in this \nrecord that Applicant requested the naked photo of C. Given the fact that a child was \ninvolved, and that he was arrested for taking liberties with a child. I find that Applicant\u2019s \nactions constitute \u201csexual behavior of a criminal nature\u201d even though he pled guilty to a \nlesser offense without a specific sexual component. AG \u00b6 13(a) applies. AG \u00b6 13(d) also \napplies given the serious lack of judgment involved. \nApplicant also did not report the matter to anyone, such as his wife or C\u2019s mother \nuntil it was discovered by C\u2019s family members. His assertion that he did not disclose the \nmatter out of concern for C is not credible. His lack of disclosure left him vulnerable to \nexploitation, coercion, or duress, so AG \u00b6 13(c) applies. \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges that Applicant\u2019s six-year-old daughter reported that he \ninappropriately touched himself in her presence while watching pornography on his \nphone in April 2021. Applicant denied the allegation.

DSS recommended that Applicant \nwork to protect his children from exposure to sexual acts as well as sexually explicit \nmaterials and conversations, but found that his children were in a safe environment in \nhis home. This allegation is not established as a Guideline D security concern. \nAG \u00b6 14 sets forth the potentially applicable mitigating conditions for sexual \nconduct: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet \nNo mitigating conditions apply. AG \u00b6\u00b6 14(b) and 14(c) are not established to \nmitigate any sexual aspects of Applicant\u2019s interactions with C for the same reasons they \nare not mitigated under Guideline J. C, then a 12-year-old child, was not old enough to \ngive meaningful consent to any part of the inappropriate interactions with Applicant. The \nbehavior was also not private or discreet. AG \u00b6 14(d) does not apply. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout, in relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe Guideline F allegations in the SOR concern several delinquencies, among \nthem consumer debts and rental debts. The debts are established by the credit reports \nin the record and by Applicant\u2019s admissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s various debts arose because he became financially overextended \nand his expenses were greater than his income. He acknowledged that his debts are \nattributable to his own actions, and not to a circumstance beyond his control, such as \nhis divorce. He addressed his debts through a debt resolution company, and made \nsteady payments of about $250 a month to address them beginning in about 2019, \nbefore he submitted his SCA, and well before the SOR was issued. Most of his debts \nwere resolved in this manner. Only two remain, because the creditors would not accept \na settlement. Applicant intends to resolve what is left, and they are small enough that he \nhas the means to do so. His recent credit reports do not show other delinquencies. An \napplicant is not expected to pay all of his SOR debts and need not address the debts in \nany particular way. What must be shown is some good-faith efforts to pay or resolve the \ndebts in a responsible way, ideally through a track record of steady payments, and a \ncredible path forward to address them. Applicant has shown sufficient evidence of that \nhere. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(c), and 20(d) all apply to mitigate financial security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines J, D, and F in my whole-person analysis. While Applicant\u2019s behavior \nhas a criminal component and a sexual component, what is most evident here is a \npattern of overall poor judgment. On multiple occasions, some alleged and some not, \nApplicant exercised poor judgment, particularly in interacting with females with whom he \neither had, or purported to have, a relationship as a fiduciary. He has a pattern of \nputting himself in position where he gets into trouble, not least by asserting an \ninappropriately protective role over the female involved, be it C, a child, or one of his \npatients. Only one of these interactions, with C, was alleged, but it is recent and serious \nenough to stand alone as unmitigated security-significant conduct that causes doubt \nover his eligibility for access to classified information. \nApplicant has not met his burden to establish that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline D: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b: \nFor Applicant \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nParagraph 3: Guideline F:   \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.f:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant access to classified information. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBraden M.

On January 6, 2023, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled \nto be conducted via video conference on January 30, 2023.

(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d.) Applicant admitted those allegations with \nexplanations. (AA.) In his Answer, he stated, in part: \u201cItems A, B, C and D [of the SOR] \nare all being actively paid and my credit-repair specialist and I are working with debtors \nto pay this debt.\u201d (AA.) At the hearing, it was established that he had made no payments \nto the three creditors with the largest balances since the summer of 2019. And there were \nand are no payment plans in place for any one of the four SOR creditors. Those debts \nare still delinquent. (Tr. 30-43.) \nApplicant is 40 years old, married since January 2005, and has two daughters ages \n18 and 14. He is a college graduate (December 2010). He served on active duty in the \nU.S. Marine Corps from June 2008 until March 2011, when he was honorably discharged \nfor medical reasons. (GE 1.) He was unemployed from March 2020 until October 2020, \nwhen he began working full time for his current employer, a defense contractor. (Tr. 22.) \nBefore his current employer, Applicant worked for his prior employer, (AN), from \nMay 2010 until they parted ways by mutual agreement with severance in March 2020. \n(Tr. 27-28; GE 1.) He started at AN as a help desk technician and by the time he left, he \nhad been promoted to the chief digital officer over his 10 years. (Tr. 23.) He and the new \nCEO disagreed over the role digital technology should play in their business. In addition, \nCOVID hit the business, shutting down many other companies, and wrecking the supply \nchain. The CEO offered him a reduced role at a much reduced salary, but then that \nopportunity was gone too. (Tr. 23-25.) \nApplicant and his CEO, which was the third CEO in two years, discussed a new \nrole for Applicant for weeks. It became apparent to him that going forward would not work. \nThe message he got was \u201chere\u2019s the door,\u201d and he was \u201cshown the door.\u201d Leaving after \n10 years was emotionally and professionally difficult. He had no steady income. He did \nleave with a severance package that was a lump sum of five months\u2019-salary; his annual \nsalary at that time was $200,000. (Tr. 25-28.) \nApplicant\u2019s salary before leaving was augmented annually with a 40% bonus. It \nwas his practice to use salary and some bonus money to pay bills and then put the rest \nin savings. Now no bonus would be paid.

Applicant testified about SOR \u00b6 1.a, a charged-off credit card for \n$10,774. He recalled that the credit limit was $10,000 but could not recall when he made \nthe last payment. Being referred to GE 5, he testified that the last payment was made in \nAugust 2019. He could not recall why he stopped payment after that, but he called the \ncreditor ahead of time to advise that he was going to stop payments. On his October 30, \n2020 SCA (GE 1), he listed this SOR debt and said that he couldn\u2019t pay as a result of \nbeing unemployed since April 2019. But in August 2019, he was still employed by AN and \nwas so employed until March 2020. In his SCA, he said the debt would be paid in full \nwithin one month. Applicant reiterated that he has not made any payments on this \naccount, since August 2019, and he agreed it remains charged off. (Tr. 30-34.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. Applicant testified about SOR \u00b6 1.b, a charged-off credit card for \n$18,914. He agreed this account was delinquent at the date of the SOR and is delinquent \ntoday. He recalled that he opened this account sometime in 2018. He recalled that the \ncredit limit was $16,000 or $17,000. He could not recall when he made the last payment. \nBeing referred to GE 5, he testified that the last payment was made in June 2019. (Tr. \n35-36.) \nReferring to GE 5 and the SOR \u00b6 1.b account, Applicant agreed that between the \nOctober 2018 opening date and the June 2019 last payment (nine months), he incurred \n$18,914 of charges. He could not recall if those charges were what caused him to stop \nmaking payments on that account. He remembered \u201cvaguely\u201d that \u201cwe had a very, very \nexpensive summer that year . . . every intent was to pay these things off and the strategy \njust didn\u2019t work this time.\u201d (Tr. 36-37.) \nReferring to his SCA (GE 1), Applicant testified that he intended to list the SOR \u00b6\n1.b account. In that SCA, he stated that he could not pay that debt, because he had been \nunemployed since April 2019. But he agreed that when he stopped paying this account, \nhe was still employed by AN. He also agreed that in his SCA, he stated that he had set \nup a payment plan to start December 1, 2020. But in his January 25, 2021 Personal \nSubject Interview (PSI) (GE 2), he was \u201cstill in the process of talking to [the creditor] to \nmake payment arrangements.\u201d In fact, no \u201cpayment arrangements or payment plans . . . \nwere ever entered into to resolve this debt.\u201d  And no payments have been made since \nJune 2019. The account remains charged off. (Tr. 37-39.) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. Applicant testified about SOR \u00b6 1.c, a charged off credit card for \n$33,972. He agreed that this charge-off existed and was delinquent at the date of the \nSOR. It remains delinquent today. He recalled that the credit limit was about $30,000 and \nthat GE 5 showed the limit to be $29,300. GE 5 showed the last payment in June 2019. \nHe agreed that GE 5 showed that between the date opened (June 2018) and the last \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \npayment (June 2019), he charged $33,972 on this card alone, which was $4,000 over the \ncredit limit. (Tr. 39-40.) \nApplicant testified that the bulk of this credit card was used for a vacation with \nseveral other families. The trip was for his whole family and lasted about 10 days. In his \nSCA (GE 1), he listed this trip as being between 11 to 20 days. He testified that this trip \ncost between $20,000 and $25,000, and he returned from this trip in May 2019. A month \nafter he returned from this trip (June 2019), he stopped making payments on the credit \ncard accounts identified in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c totaling $52,886. In his SCA, he stated \nthat he could not pay SOR \u00b6 1.c, because he had been unemployed since April 2019. But \nin June 2019, he was employed by AN. No payment plan or payment arrangements were \never put in place to resolve this debt. The account remains charged off. (Tr. 40-43.) \nApplicant was questioned about his obligations for the three credit card accounts \ndiscussed above. He agreed with the following: \nFor each of the three credit card accounts, he had written agreements with the \ncreditors. \nThose agreements had a promise on his part to pay for all his charges to those \naccounts. \nHe agreed to pay at least a minimum amount each month by the due date. \nWhen he made purchases in person, he signed a credit card slip agreeing to abide \nby the repayment terms of the cardholder agreement. \nWhen he signed those slips, he indicated his continued agreement to pay for the \nproducts or services he was receiving at the time. \nOver the years when these accounts were active, he received goods and services \nworth thousands of dollars that he never paid for. \nEven though these charges have been charged off, he remains legally obligated \nto pay those debts. (Tr. 43-44.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. Applicant testified about SOR \u00b6 1.d, an account in collection for $1,854. \nHe admitted this debt in his response to the SOR. He admitted that he is indebted to this \ncreditor today and that the account remains delinquent. This debt was for the purchase \nof a guitar. In his PSI (GE 2), he said he would be making arrangements to resolve this \ndebt, but no such arrangements were ever made. (Tr. 44-46.) \nApplicant testified about his current personal finances. He has no concern that his \nannual salary will deviate in any way. Other than his current annual salary ($200,000), he \nhas two other sources of income, a 75% VA disability payment and his wife\u2019s salary as a \nsocial worker, $38,000 per year.

He owns two \ncars. One is a 2017 model his oldest daughter drives and that he paid for in cash. The \nother is a 2022 model purchased new. The new car cost $52,000, and the monthly \npayment is $871.85. (Tr. 23, 46-48.) \nApplicant recently purchased a home for $760,000. His monthly mortgage \npayment is $4,955. He does not support anyone else. After his monthly expenses, he has \n$7,062 left. That money is split between savings and college tuition. He only has one \nactive credit card. He does not owe any state or federal taxes, and he has never failed to \nfile his state or federal tax returns. Other than his home purchase, he has not made any \nlarge purchases. On advice of his financial advisor, he sold both boats. He has not had \nany difficulty staying current on his debts in the past year. Since receiving the SOR, he \nused a credit consultant (or credit repair specialist). (Tr. 48-51.) \nApplicant introduced an exhibit identifying five accounts not alleged in the SOR. \n(AG.) The record shows Applicant to be current (PAY AS AGREED) and no delinquent \namounts past due on those accounts. (GE 3-5.) \nCharacter Witness. Applicant called a retired U.S. Navy Rear Admiral as a \ncharacter witness. He is the President and Chairman of the Board of Applicant\u2019s current \nemployer. He served for 36 years on reserve and active duty. In his past five or six years \nof active duty, he held court martial power and was familiar with legal processes. He was \nresponsible for about 600 naval service members and was very involved with security \nclearances. In that position, he suspended many security clearances for a variety of \nreasons. (Tr. 15-16.) \nThe witness has been in his current civilian position for about two and a half years. \nApplicant was one of the very first hires he made. When the witness came to this \ncompany, it needed someone really adept at business processes and how to do that from \na digital basis. So, he hired Applicant as Director of IT. He did everything the witness \nasked him to do; he helped create the business planning processes and get IT systems \nin place. He did such a \u201cphenomenally good job\u201d that of the 10 leadership team members, \nApplicant was the only one the witness has promoted. The witness has turned over half \nof the work force to him. His leadership in operations includes the repair side, field service, \nand maintaining IT.

(Tr. 20-21.) \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n\u00b62(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, then the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel . . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nany questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means . . . or irresponsible spending. \nApplicant\u2019s SOR debts are established by his admissions and the Government\u2019s \ncredit reports. He has been employed full-time by his current employer, since October \n2020. He currently makes $200,000 per year. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (b), (c), and (e) apply. \nAG \u00b6 20 includes the following conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant made his last payments on three of the four SOR accounts in the summer \nof 2019. The last activity on the fourth account was in 2020. That was not that long ago. \nMore importantly, those four accounts remain currently delinquent. Their status, therefore, \nreflects poorly on Applicant\u2019s current reliability. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) has two requirements. First, the conditions causing financial problems \nmust have been \u201clargely beyond\u201d an applicant\u2019s control. Second, the applicant must have \n\u201cacted responsibly\u201d under the adverse circumstances he confronted. \nFor the three largest SOR debts, Applicant testified that his reason for not paying \nthose debts was because he had been unemployed since April 2019. In fact, he agreed \nthat in April 2019, he was still fully employed by AN (at $200,000 a year before bonuses), \nuntil he left that company in March 2020. Leaving AN in March 2020, even on short notice, \ncould not possibly have caused him to be unable to make payments to those three SOR \ncreditors in 2019. In short, leaving AN in March 2020 was largely beyond his control, but \nit did not result in Applicant being unable to pay creditors a year earlier, in 2019. \nBetween 2018 and 2019, he ran up over $50,000 in debt on just two credit cards, \n$25,000 of which was for a family vacation. And on one card, he exceeded the $29,300 \ncredit limit by $4,000. It is more likely that his excessive spending on credit caused his \ninability to pay. In fact, those same accounts remain delinquent today, four years after \nthat vacation. Because the first requirement of AG \u00b6 20(b) is not met, there is no need to \naddress the second requirement. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nThere were and are no payment plans in place to repay the SOR creditors. \nTherefore, AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. \nAs part of my application of our facts to the whole-person concept, I have \nconsidered two facts that are not alleged in the SOR. Unalleged conduct cannot be an \nindependent basis for a denial. It can, however, be used to evaluate credibility and in the \nwhole-person concept. See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). \nThose two facts will be considered only for those limited purposes. \nFirst, Applicant introduced evidence of five accounts not alleged in the SOR. The \nrecord shows Applicant to be current (PAY AS AGREED) with no delinquent amounts \npast due on those accounts. I have considered this evidence in his favor showing sound \nfinancial judgment. \nSecond, in Applicant\u2019s October 8, 2021 Answer he stated, in part: \u201cItems A, B, C \nand D [of the SOR] are all being actively paid and my credit repair specialist and I are \nworking with debtors to pay this debt.\u201d The record established, however, that on the date \nof the Answer, there were no payment plans in place. The record also established that \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n_____________________________ \nthere were no such plans in place on the day of the hearing. Finally, the record established \nthat throughout the security clearance process, the SOR creditors were not \u201cbeing actively \npaid.\u201d In fact, they have not been paid since 2019 or 2020. Applicant\u2019s statements were \neither less than candid, at best, or false, at worst. See 18 U.S.C. 1001. \nI also carefully considered and weighed the testimony of Applicant\u2019s character \nwitness. The witnesses\u2019 credentials and relevant experience are impeccable. He retired \nfrom the Navy as a Rear Admiral after over 30 years of active duty. In his last command, \nhe had court martial authority. He has experience with legal processes and is intimately \nfamiliar with security clearances. \nThe witness is President and Chairman of the Board of Applicant\u2019s current \nemployer. Although he has only known Applicant for about two and a half years, he was \none of the witnesses\u2019 first hires. Early on, Applicant proved how adept he was in business \noperations and IT. As a result, the witness turned over about half of the work force to \nApplicant. Of ten leadership team members, Applicant was the only one the witness \npromoted. \nThe witness finds Applicant honest to a fault, including about his clearance \nprocess. Applicant has the witness\u2019 full faith and trust and strongly recommends granting \nApplicant a clearance. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F and in this section in my \nwhole-person analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing \nthe disqualifying and mitigating conditions under that guideline and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance is denied. \nPhilip J. Katauskas \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n\n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n10 \n",

The Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on August 5, 2022, scheduling the \nhearing for September 1, 2022. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. I appended to the record as Hearing \nExhibit (HE) I and II, respectively, the Government\u2019s exhibit list and administrative notice \nrequest. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A and B \nwere admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified. At Applicant\u2019s request \nand without objection, I left the record open until October 3, 2022, for additional \ndocumentation. Applicant timely submitted documentation that I marked as AE C and \nadmitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September \n12, 2022. \nRequest for Administrative Notice  \nAs noted above, Department Counsel\u2019s request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts about Israel was included in the record as HE II. I marked and included \nin the record as HE III two updated reports from which I took administrative notice of \nmore recent facts about Israel. One report was issued by the Congressional Research \nService on November 16, 2022, and is entitled, \u201cIsrael: Background and U.S. Relations \nin Brief.\u201d The second is an October 13, 2022 travel advisory issued by the U.S. \nDepartment of State on Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza. I have taken administrative \nnotice of facts about Israel, contained in HE II and HE III, which are summarized below. \nIsrael \nIsrael has forged close bilateral cooperation with the United States in many \nareas. A 10-year bilateral military aid memorandum of understanding commits the \nUnited States to provide Israel $3.3 billion in foreign military financing and spend $500 \nmillion annually on joint missile defense programs from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year \n2028, subject to congressional appropriations. \nAfter elections held on November 1, 2022, for Israel\u2019s parliament (Knesset), \nLikud party leader Benjamin Netanyahu is again the prime minister, a post he held \ntwice previously, from 1996 to 1999 and 2009 to 2021. The 2022 election was the fifth \nheld in Israel since a formal process began in December 2018 addressing corruption \nallegations against Netanyahu. Two of the previous four elections did not result in the \nformation of a government, and the other two resulted in short-lived coalition \ngovernments, a 2020 to 2021 government with Netanyahu as prime minister, and a \n2021 to 2022 government without him. The rise of the ultra-nationalist Religious \nZionism faction as a likely Netanyahu coalition partner has triggered debate about the \nimplications for Israel\u2019s democracy, its ability to manage tensions with Arabs and \nPalestinians, and its relations with the United States and other countries. \nAn October 2022 travel warning issued by the U.S. Department of State for \nIsrael, the West Bank, and Gaza is at Level 2: Exercise Increased Caution, advising \ntravelers to exercise increased caution in Israel and the West bank due to terrorism \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand civil unrest, and not to travel to Gaza due to terrorism, civil unrest, and armed \nconflict. The Sunni Islamist militant group Hamas, a U.S. Government-designated \nforeign terrorist organization, controls the security infrastructure in Gaza, and the \nsecurity environment within Gaza and on its borders is dangerous and volatile. \nIn hopes of preserving the viability of a negotiated two-state solution among \nIsraelis and Palestinians, U.S. Government officials have sought to help manage \ntensions, bolster Israel\u2019s defensive capabilities, and strengthen U.S.-Palestinian ties. \nU.S. Government officials have regularly spoken out against steps taken by Israelis or \nPalestinians that could risk sparking violence and undermining the vision of two states, \nincluding settlement expansion and settler violence, demolitions, evictions, incitement to \nviolence, and payments for individuals imprisoned for acts of terrorism. Israeli-\nPalestinian violence in 2022 and increased West Bank militancy has triggered \nheightened counterterrorism measures and some controversy, including in relation to \nthe killing of journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, a U.S. citizen who was a resident of East \nJerusalem. With the Gaza Strip still under the control of the Hamas, the United States \nand other international actors face significant challenges in seeking to help with \nreconstruction without bolstering the group. \nSignificant human rights issues in 2021 included credible reports of unlawful or \narbitrary killings; arbitrary detention, often extraterritorial detention of Palestinians from \nthe occupied territories in Israel; restrictions on Palestinians residing in Jerusalem \nincluding arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy, family, and home; substantial \ninterference with the freedom of association; arbitrary or unlawful interference with \nprivacy; harassment of nongovernmental organizations; significant restrictions on \nfreedom of movement within the country; violence against asylum seekers and irregular \nmigrants; violence or threats of violence against national, racial, or ethnic minority \ngroups; and labor rights abuses against foreign workers and Palestinians from the West \nBank. \nThe U.S. Department of State advises that all persons seeking to enter or depart \nIsrael, the West Bank, or Gaza are subject to immigration and security screening, \npossibly including prolonged questioning and physical searches, and may be denied \nentry or exit. Some U.S. citizens of Arab or Muslim heritage, including Palestinian-\nAmericans, have experienced significant difficulties, unequal, and occasionally hostile \ntreatment at Israel\u2019s borders and checkpoints. Israeli security officials have also on \noccasion requested access to travelers\u2019 personal e-mail accounts or other social media \naccounts as a condition of entry. In such circumstances, travelers should have no \nexpectation of privacy for any data stored on such devices or in their accounts. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c-1.d, and 2.b-2.h, and he denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, \n2.a, and 3.a.

Nothing \nmaterialized and the initiatives fell apart because the U.S. DOD agency reoriented \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntowards addressing COVID in March 2020. (Tr. at 97-104, 110-155, 175-177, 182, 184; \nGE 1, 3; AE A-C) \nAs of the date of the hearing and since approximately October 2018, Applicant \nand an Israeli citizen, who resides in Israel and is a reservist in the Israeli military, co-\ninvented a medical device for which they were in the process of obtaining a patent and \nseeking potential investors. Applicant expects to receive a percentage of any royalties \nthat might come about, but he had not received any such compensation as of the date \nof the hearing. He maintained that his work with this Israeli citizen for this medical \ndevice was not affiliated with the Israeli government, military, or defense industry. (Tr. at \n102-104, 110-111,130-134, 182; GE 1, 3) \nApplicant testified that he has reported to his facility security officer (FSO) his \ntrips to Israel and his foreign contacts. He also testified that he would comply with \nreporting requirements and notify his FSO of any future consulting work, to include any \nsuch work in Israel. He did not provide any evidence to show that he reported his \ncontinued work on the medical device, with the Israeli citizen and resident who is a \nreservist in the Israeli military. He disclosed the above-discussed information on his \n2012 and 2020 SCAs and during his 2012 and 2020 background interviews. He testified \nthat no one has approached him about U.S. classified information. (Tr. at 74-76, 144-\n148; GE 1-3) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. The protection of the national security is the \nparamount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel \nbeing considered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of national \nsecurity.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business\nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or\nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest; and \n(i) conduct, especially while traveling or residing outside the U.S., that may \nmake the individual vulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a \nforeign person, group, government, or country. \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, \nand its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s \nfamily members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States. In considering the nature of the government, an administrative judge \nmust also consider any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR \nCase No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) (reversing decision to grant \nclearance where administrative judge did not consider terrorist activity in area where \nfamily members resided). AG \u00b6 7(a) requires substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened \nrisk.\u201d The \u201cheightened risk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a \nrelatively low standard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk \ninherent in having a family member living under a foreign government. \nApplicant\u2019s spouse is a dual citizen of Israel and the United States, and they \nreside together in Israel for over half of every year since becoming legal residents of \nIsrael in 2015. Applicant maintains regular contact with Cousin, Cousin\u2019s spouse, his \nrabbi, and two professional contacts, all of whom are Israeli citizens and residents. \nCousin\u2019s spouse is a former member of the Israeli military and a self-employed \nconsultant to the Israeli defense industry. \nOne of Applicant\u2019s professional contacts in Israel is a former officer in the Israeli \nmilitary and owned a company that has had contracts with the Israeli defense industry. \nApplicant consulted for this individual in Israel for several years beginning in 2016, and \nApplicant served as a liaison between this individual and an agency of the U.S. DOD \nfrom approximately 2019 to March 2020. Applicant\u2019s other professional contact in \nIsrael also has a company affiliated with the Israeli defense industry, and Applicant \nworked part time for this company from December 2016 to September 2017. An \nOctober 2022 travel warning issued by the U.S. Department of State advised travelers \nto exercise increased caution in Israel and the West Bank due to terrorism and civil \nunrest, and not to travel to Gaza due to terrorism, civil unrest, and armed conflict. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFrom approximately 2019 to March 2020, Applicant was a liaison between four \nIsraeli companies and a U.S. DOD agency while he was in Israel. One of the Israeli \ncompanies is owned by one of Applicant\u2019s professional contacts in Israel who is a \nformer officer in the Israeli military, and who owns at least one company that has held \ncontracts with the Israeli defense industry, as discussed above. Should any contracts \nhave materialized between any of these four Israeli companies and the U.S. DOD \nagency, Applicant would have received a finder\u2019s fee from the Israeli company. While \nhis work was encouraged by the U.S. DOD agency, he was not funded by it nor was \nthere any agreement that the agency would pay him for it. As of the date of the \nhearing, Applicant maintains his registration with the Israeli tax authority to work as a \nself-employed consultant in Israel, and he continues to work with another Israeli citizen \nand resident, who is a reservist in the Israeli military, as co-inventor of a medical \ndevice for which they were working to patent and secure potential investors. Applicant \nexpects to receive a percentage of any royalties that might come about from this \ndevice. \nApplicant does not expect to receive Israeli social security benefits until 2027, in \nfour and a half years, and if he does receive such benefits, it would be in the nominal \namount of $500 USD monthly. As such, I find that AG \u00b6 7(f) does not apply to SOR \u00b6 \n2.g, and I find that allegation in Applicant\u2019s favor. However, he has significant assets in \nIsrael totaling approximately $1,070,000 USD, which include his apartment valued at \napproximately $1,000,000 as of the date of the hearing, and his bank account that had a \nbalance of approximately $70,000 USD as of the date of the hearing. Applicant\u2019s \ncontacts and financial interests in Israel create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), 7(e), 7(f), and 7(i) \napply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.f and 2.h. \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which  \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation;  \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and  \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nApplicant disclosed the above-discussed information on his 2012 and 2020 \nSCAs and during his 2012 and 2020 background interviews. He intends to continue to \ncomply with reporting requirements and disclose to his FSO his foreign contacts, \nforeign travels, and any future consulting work, to include any such work in Israel. AG \u00b6 \n8(e) is established. \nAG \u00b6 8(d) is established, in part, because Applicant\u2019s contacts with the four \nIsraeli companies for whom Applicant served as a liaison to the U.S. DOD agency, was \nencouraged by the U.S. DOD agency. However, AG \u00b6 8(d) is not established for \nApplicant\u2019s professional contact in Israel who is a former officer in the Israeli military \nand owns a company that has had contracts with the Israeli defense industry. It is also \nnot established for Applicant\u2019s other professional contact in Israel whose company is \naffiliated with the Israeli defense industry. It is also not established for Applicant\u2019s \ncontinued work with another Israeli citizen and resident, who is a reservist in the Israeli \nmilitary, as co-inventor of a medical device for which he expects to receive a \npercentage of any potential royalties. \nIn addition, AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a), 8(c), and 8(f) are not established for the reasons set \nforth in the above discussion of AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), 7(e), 7(f), and 7(i). Applicant, his \nspouse, his children, and his siblings are all native-born U.S. citizens. His children and \nsiblings reside in the United States. He has substantial financial interests in the United \nStates. These are all factors that weigh in Applicant\u2019s favor. However, his ties to Israel \nare also strong. He maintains personal and professional contact with Israeli citizens \nand residents, and three of his professional contacts have ties to the Israeli \ngovernment, military, or defense industry. He also has significant financial interests \nthere. As such, Applicant has not met his burden of demonstrating that he would \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(b) is not \nestablished. \nGuideline C: Foreign Preference \nThe security concern for foreign preference is set out in AG \u00b6 9: \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may provide \ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnited States. Foreign involvement raises concerns about an individual's \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness when it is in conflict with U.S. \nnational interests or when the individual acts to conceal it. By itself; the \nfact that a U.S. citizen is also a citizen of another country is not \ndisqualifying without an objective showing of such conflict or attempt at \nconcealment. The same is true for a U.S. citizen's exercise of any right or \nprivilege of foreign citizenship and any action to acquire or obtain \nrecognition of a foreign citizenship. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 10. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) applying for and/or acquiring citizenship in any other country; and \n(d) participation in foreign activities, including but not limited to: \n(1) assuming or attempting to assume any type of employment, \nposition, or political office in a foreign government or military \norganization; and \n(2) otherwise acting to serve the interests of a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in any way that conflicts with U.S. national \nsecurity interests. \nNo disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 10 are raised by Applicant\u2019s residence in \nIsrael for half or more than half of every year in part to remain eligible for Israeli social \nsecurity benefits and health care there. As such, I find SOR \u00b6 1.c in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nAs previously discussed, in 2016, Applicant consulted for an Israeli citizen and resident \nwhose company has had contracts with the Israeli defense industry. From 2016 to \n2017, he worked for another Israeli company that has affiliations with the Israeli \ndefense industry. His work as a liaison between four Israeli companies and a U.S. DOD \nagency was encouraged by the U.S. DOD agency, who was aware that Applicant \nwould receive a finder\u2019s fee if a contract materialized for any of the Israeli companies. \nHis continued work with an Israeli citizen and resident, who is a reservist in the Israeli \nmilitary, pertains to a medical device. He maintained that none of the work he did was \naffiliated with the Israeli government, military, or defense industry. AG \u00b6\u00b6 10(d)(1) and \n10(d)(2) do not apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, and I find this allegation in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nHowever, Applicant is a native-born U.S. citizen who became an Israeli citizen \nand resident in 2015. In addition, he has voted in at least three Israeli elections since \nMarch 2019. AG \u00b6 10(a) applies to SOR \u00b6 1.a and AG \u00b6 10(d), \u201cparticipation in foreign \nactivities . . .\u201d applies to SOR \u00b6 1.d. \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate foreign preference security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 11. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the foreign citizenship is not in conflict with U.S. national security \ninterests; and \n(e) the exercise of the entitlements or benefits of foreign citizenship do not \npresent a national security concern. \nAs previously discussed, although Applicant has voted in at least three Israeli \nelections since March 2019, he has also voted in the United States. His voting in Israel \ndoes not present a national security concern. In addition, Applicant\u2019s dual citizenship with \nIsrael and the United States is not in conflict with U.S. national security interests. As \nsuch, I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 11(a) and 11(e) are established for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d. \nGuideline L: Outside Activities \nThe security concern for outside activities is set out in AG \u00b6 36: \nInvolvement in certain types of outside employment or activities is of \nsecurity concern if it poses a conflict of interest with an individual\u2019s \nsecurity responsibilities and could create an increased risk of unauthorized \ndisclosure of classified or sensitive information. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 37. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any employment or service, whether compensated or volunteer, with: . . . \n(2) any foreign national, organization, or other entity; and \n(3) a representative of any foreign interest. \nIn 2016, Applicant worked for an Israeli citizen and resident whose company has \nhad contracts with the Israeli defense industry. From 2016 to 2017, he worked for \nanother Israeli company that also has affiliations with the Israeli defense industry \noccurred. He served as a liaison between four Israeli companies and a U.S. DOD \nagency from 2019 to 2020. Since 2018, he has worked with another Israeli citizen and \nresident, who is a reservist in the Israeli military, as co-inventor of a medical device. As \nof the date of the hearing, they were in the process of obtaining a patent for the device, \nand they were also seeking out potential investors. He also expects to receive a \npercentage of any potential royalties. AG \u00b6\u00b6 37(a)(2) and 37(a)(3) apply. \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \nConditions that could mitigate foreign preference security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 38. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) evaluation of the outside employment or activity by the appropriate \nsecurity or counterintelligence office indicates that it does not pose a \nconflict with an individual\u2019s security responsibilities or with the national \nsecurity interests of the United States; and \n(b) the individual terminated the employment or discontinued the activity \nupon being notified that it was in conflict with his or her security \nresponsibilities. \nAs previously discussed in my analyses under Guideline B and Guideline C, \nApplicant\u2019s work for an Israeli citizen and resident whose company has had contracts \nwith the Israeli defense industry occurred in 2016. His work for another Israeli company \nthat also has affiliations with the Israeli defense industry occurred from 2016 to 2017. \nHis liaison work for four Israeli companies occurred from 2019 to 2020, at the \nencouragement of the U.S. DOD agency, and nothing materialized from them. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n38(a) and 38(b) are established for these activities. \nAs previously stated, Applicant did not provide any evidence to show that he \nreported to his FSO his continued work on a medical device with the Israeli citizen and \nresident who is a reservist in the Israeli military. Such work was ongoing as of the date \nof the hearing, as he and this individual were in the process of obtaining a patent for the \ndevice and seeking potential investors. He also expects to receive a percentage of any \nfuture royalties. AG \u00b6\u00b6 38(a) and 38(b) are not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines B, C, and L in my whole-\nperson analysis. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under these \nthree guidelines and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude that Applicant mitigated the foreign preference security concerns, but he did \nnot mitigate either the foreign influence or outside activities security concerns. \nAccordingly, I conclude that he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant his eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \nFOR Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \nAGAINST Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.g: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline L:  \nAGAINST Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On September 22, 2022, Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), including documents identified as Items 1 \nthrough 8. Applicant received the FORM on November 10, 2022. He was afforded 30 \ndays after receiving the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation.

Applicant\u2019s admission is accepted as a finding of fact. (Item 1) \nApplicant is 56 years old. He enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in 1985, and he received \nan honorable discharge in 1996. He was married and divorced twice. He was married a \nthird time to a Filipino national in 2000, and the marriage was annulled in 2013. In August \n2020, he met a female citizen of Thailand online, with whom he maintains a long-distance \nromantic relationship. Since January 2021, Applicant has worked for a government \ncontractor, and his job title is fuel-systems employee. (Items 1, 3 and 4) \nPersonal Conduct \nThe SOR alleges personal conduct security concerns under Guideline E. On April \n25, 2013, Applicant\u2019s employment with a government contractor was terminated following \nan investigation into computer misuse. His United Arab Emirates (UAE) base privileges \nwere revoked, and he was barred from the UAE worksite. (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) When he \ncompleted the security clearance application in January 2021, he deliberately \nmisrepresented his 2013 employment termination. He listed that his employment with the \ngovernment contractor began in March 2005 continuing through March 2014, and his \nemployment concluded at that time due to \u201cend of contract.\u201d (SOR \u00b6 1.b.) Applicant denied \nthese allegations. (Items 1 and 2) \nIn his SOR response, Applicant claimed that he was released from employment \n\u201cdue to other issues and slots closing.\u201d He stated that he inadvertently misdated the end \ndate (March 2014) of his employment \u201cby a few months.\u201d He provided a letter from the \ngovernment contractor as supporting evidence. The letter dated April 25, 2013, stated \nthat Applicant was being terminated effective the date of the letter \u201cdue to customer \nrestrictions in [his] current position.\u201d It did not mention that his employment ended after \nfulfillment of a contract, as listed on the 2021 SCA. The Government submitted an \nadverse incident report and a current email communication from the human resources \n(HR) department of this former employer. Both documents showed that Applicant was \nterminated in 2013 as follows: (Items 1, 2, 4 and 5) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cSubject\u2019s employment with [DOD contractor] has been terminated due to \nongoing investigation into computer misuse. Base pass was revoked by \nUAE and he was barred from the UAE site. Investigation was being \nconducted by the Emirates.\u201d (Item 5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges that Applicant falsified his January 2021 SCA by deliberately \nomitting information about his close and continuing contact with a citizen of Thailand, with \nwhom he had a romantic relationship and to whom he was providing financial support at \nthe time. In his February 2022 SOR response, he denied this allegation, but admitted that \nhe is very close with the foreign national and he had recently asked her to marry him. \nSince she is his fianc\u00e9e, he expected that if she requested monetary assistance in the \nfuture, he would provide it to her. (Items 1, 2, 3 and 4) \nForeign Influence  \nThe SOR alleges a Guideline B security concern that Applicant has maintained \nclose and continuing contact with a citizen of Thailand, whom he met online in August \n2020, and to whom he has provided financial support. (SOR \u00b6 2.a.) In his February 2022 \nSOR response, he admitted this information and explained that they are now engaged \nbut they have not set a wedding date. During his background interview in March 2021, he \nfreely disclosed, without confrontation by the investigator, that they met online in August \n2020, after she was introduced to him by mutual friends. She is independently wealthy \nand does not need to work. They communicate with each other almost daily. She has a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in hotel management. In February 2021, she requested that he send \nher $200, and he did so without requiring an explanation. She is unaware of this job and \nhis current DOD security clearance. She is not affiliated with Thailand\u2019s government, and \nhe made an inadvertent mistake by not listing her on his SCA. He stated that he has \nserved honorably in the U.S. military for over a decade, he is an American first, and he \nwould never betray his country. (Items 1, 2, 3 and 4) \nFinancial Considerations  \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant has an outstanding state tax \nlien filed against him in the amount of approximately $6,000, and he has a consumer \ncredit account that was charged off in 2020 for $11,232. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.b.) Applicant \ndenied these allegations. He claimed that he never resided in the state that filed a tax lien \nagainst him, and he was considering hiring a company or firm to dispute this lien. During \nApplicant\u2019s 2012 clearance investigation, a February 2012 credit report listed this \nSeptember 2010 state tax lien. Court records dated October 2021 also report this \noutstanding state tax lien. (Items 1, 2, 6 and 8) \nApplicant\u2019s February 2021 credit report lists the delinquent credit account. \nApplicant claimed in his SOR response that his delinquent consumer account was paid \nfollowing his March 2021 background interview. He had opened this account to make \nrepairs on his home. He did not submit any documentary evidence to corroborate his \nclaim.

As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16 includes the following conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of:  \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nIn his January 2021 SCA, Applicant deliberately omitted his 2013 employment \ntermination. In April 2013, his employment was terminated for misconduct. Department \nCounsel did not prove that Applicant intentionally falsified information on the SCA about \nhis close continuing relationship with a foreign national, and that he had recently provided \nmonetary support to this foreign national. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a), 16(d), and 16(e) apply. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides the following potential conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns in this case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nDuring the March 2021 background interview, Applicant provided details about the \nforeign national. He told the investigator that he should have listed her on the January \n2021 SCA, and it was an oversight on his part. He disclosed during his interview that he \nhad provided the female foreign national $200 in February 2021. In this instance, \nApplicant could not have intentionally omitted information about providing financial \nsupport to a foreign national on the January 2021 SCA because the conduct had not yet \noccurred. I find Applicant was candid and provided prompt information about his \nrelationship with the foreign national without confrontation from the investigator during his \nMarch 2021 background interview. Personal conduct security concerns are mitigated for \nSOR \u00b6 1.c. \nApplicant continues to deny his 2013 termination for cause and his deliberate \nmisrepresentation of his termination on the January 2021 SCA. The Government\u2019s \nevidence in the record is clear, unequivocal, and convincing. Thus, none of the mitigating \nconditions apply. Personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nand 1.b. \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is set out in AG \n\u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions under AG \u00b6 7 that could raise \nsecurity concerns, and the following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n(c) failure to report or fully disclose, when required, association with a \nforeign person, group, government, or country. \nThe Government failed to provide specific and current information about the \ncountry in which the foreign national is located, to include whether it is known to target \nU.S. citizens to obtain classified information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. The \nGovernment failed to establish \u201cheightened risk\u201d under AG \u00b6 7(a).  \nThe conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States;  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. The United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those \nof the United States. The distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must \nbe made with caution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and \nunexpectedly. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant discussed the Thai foreign national during his background interview. He \nnoted that they were introduced by mutual friends, and she had no connections to the \nGovernment of Thailand. She is unaware of this job or that he possesses a DOD security \nclearance. He admitted it was oversight on his part when he did not disclose her on the \nJanuary 2021 SCA. They became engaged in approximately February 2022. Applicant \nwas in this type of situation before during his three-year marriage with another foreign \nnational. He is fully aware of the Government\u2019s concerns under these circumstances. He \nserved honorably in the U.S. Air Force for over ten years, and he has worked overseas \nfor several years as a DOD contractor. He stated that he is an American first, and he \nwould never betray his country. He has such deep and longstanding relationships and \nloyalties in the United States, I find that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest. AG \u00b6 8(b) applies. Foreign influence security \nconcerns are mitigated. \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nThe SOR debts are established by the tax lien record and the two credit reports. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c) and 19(f) apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;   \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangement with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nIn his February 2022 SOR response, Applicant denied that he had ever resided in \nthe state that had filed the tax lien against him in 2010, and he planned to hire a tax \ncompany to take care of this issue. During a previous investigation, the unreleased state \ntax was listed on his February 2012 credit report in the amount of approximately $6,000. \nThe October 2021 Westlaw state court research document showed the state tax lien \ncontinued to be unresolved. \nIn March 2021, Applicant was placed on notice during his background interview \nthat he had an outstanding credit account. He acknowledged he had opened the account \nto make repairs on his home. The February 2021 credit report showed the account was \nreferred for collection in the amount of $11,232. In his February 2022 SOR response, he \nstated that he had paid this account after his interview. He did not provide a receipt or \ndocumentation to support his claim. (Items 2, 3, 6, 7 and 8) \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues were not due to circumstances beyond his control. \nAlthough he provided a detailed explanation in his SOR response about the two debts, \nhe provided no corroborating proof of payment for the collection account, and he did not \nsubmit any extenuating information about the resolution of his 2010 state tax lien with the \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nstate tax authority. There is insufficient documentary evidence in the record showing \nApplicant\u2019s efforts to resolve either debt. As such, I find that Applicant\u2019s financial problems \nare not under control and are likely to recur. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \nApplicant failed to mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines E, B, and F and the AG \u00b6 2(d) factors \nin this whole-person analysis. \nApplicant is 56 years old. Since January 2021, he has been employed by a \ngovernment contractor. He enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in 1985, and he received an \nhonorable discharge in 1996. He is currently engaged to a Thai foreign national he met \nonline after being introduced by mutual friends. \nApplicant failed to list the true circumstances of his April 2013 employment \ntermination with a former DOD contractor when he listed that his employment, lasting \nover a decade, ended in March 2014 after the \u201ccontract ended.\u201d This was untrue, and \nwhen he listed the information on his 2021 SCA, he knew it was a falsehood. The \nGovernment\u2019s evidence in the record was clear and persuasive. \nApplicant also failed to provide supporting documentation that he had paid an \noverdue consumer account, as claimed. He failed to submit any action undertaken to \nresolve a longstanding tax lien filed in 2010 that was discovered during his 2012 \nbackground investigation. The evidence in the record shows his consumer account and \nstate tax lien remain unresolved. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nOverall, Applicant\u2019s deliberate misrepresentation of his past employment \ntermination and his inability or unwillingness to resolve his financial issues raise questions \nabout his trustworthiness, reliability, and ability to protect classified information. I have \ncarefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the \nAGs, to the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Although foreign \ninfluence security concerns were found in his favor, I conclude that personal conduct and \nfinancial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b.: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c.: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a.: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a and 3.b.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n11 \n",

Or.) 12968, Access to Classified \nInformation, dated August 2, 1995; DoD Manual 5200.02, Procedures for the DoD \nPersonnel Security Program (PSP), effective on April 3, 2017 (DoDM 5200.02); and \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4 (SEAD 4), establishing in Appendix A the National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective on June 8, 2017. \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DoD CAF notified Applicant that it intended to \ndeny or revoke his security clearance because it did not find that it is clearly consistent \nwith the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. Specifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guidelines E, \nG, H, and J.

(GE 3 at 21) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 2.a allege Applicant was arrested on December 21, 1997, and he \nwas charged with driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), driving on a suspended or \nrevoked driver\u2019s license, and operating an uninsured motor vehicle. On January 7, 2000, \nhe pleaded guilty to DUI, and he was sentenced to 12 months of supervised probation \nbefore judgment and assessed fines and court costs totaling $800. (Tr. 35-36; GE 3 at \n23) Applicant said he was in a car accident, and he consented to a blood-alcohol test \n(BAT). (Tr. 35) His BAT was above the legal limit. (Tr. 35-36) He completed the alcohol \ncounseling classes, and his driver\u2019s license was reinstated. (Tr. 36)  \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges Applicant was arrested on August 22, 1998, and he was \ncharged with obstruction of justice/destruction of evidence and attempted false report of \nan offense, both felonies. He was convicted of these offenses and sentenced to 11 \nmonths of probation and assessed fines and court costs totaling $250. (GE 3 at24-26) \nApplicant said he remembered being arrested after he swore at a police officer; however, \nhe claimed he could not recall ever going to court or being charged with the offenses. (Tr. \n37) Somehow he was found guilty and he \u201cnever knew about it again until [he] went \nthrough this investigation process right here.\u201d (Tr. 37) He said his mother checked with \nthe police department and they did not have any record of the arrests. (Tr. 38) He did not \nindicate she checked the court records for evidence of his conviction. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges Applicant was arrested on March 29, 2003, and he was charged \nwith possession of marijuana (less than 2.5 grams) and possession of drug paraphernalia. \n(GE 3 at 27-31) Applicant said a police officer was harassing him, and the police officer \nfound a bottle with a marijuana stem in it under his vehicle\u2019s seat. (Tr. 38, 40) When he \narrived at the police station, \u201cthe chief of police\u201d pleaded with Applicant not to make a \ncomplaint against the [arresting] officer because he was in the process of being dismissed \nas a result of the police officer\u2019s disorderly conduct. (Tr. 39) Applicant was charged; \nhowever, the charges were eventually dismissed. (Tr. 39; GE 3 at 31-32) He said the \nmarijuana was under the passenger\u2019s seat, and it was not his marijuana. (Tr. 41) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges Applicant was arrested on January 29, 2011, and he was \ncharged with possession of marijuana (less than 1 ounce). SOR \u00b6 1.d alleges Applicant \nfailed to appear for a court date on September 16, 2011, and a warrant was issued for his \narrest. (GE 3 at 5-10) Applicant said he was in a vehicle with five other individuals, and \nthe police found marijuana in one of their bags. (Tr. 43) He said it was not his marijuana. \n(Tr. 43) On November 4, 2019, an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator \ninterviewed Applicant about the warrant for his arrest, and Applicant said he did not intend \nto resolve it until his child custody issues were resolved. (OPM Report of Investigation \n(ROI) at 7) As of March 31, 2022, the charge was pending. \nAt Applicant\u2018s hearing, he said he recently paid $1,150 to resolve the charge. (Tr. \n42) He said he \u201ccalled and over the phone paid with [his] credit card and then that was \npretty much it, a done deal.\u201d (Tr. 43-44) He said he would provide documentation after \n3 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe hearing showing the charge was resolved; however, he did not provide anything.

(Tr. \n45-48) She told the police he assaulted her. (Tr. 47) When he went to court, she withdrew \nher allegations. (Tr. 47) He denied that he was violent towards her. (Tr. 49) He believed \nit would be best if he moved to a different state to get away from her. (Tr. 50) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges Applicant was arrested on February 7, 2018, and he was \ncharged with violation of a civil no contact order. (GE 3 at 33-34) Applicant said the charge \nwas dismissed because the civil no contact order did not exist. (Tr. 51-52) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.a allege Applicant was arrested on July 22, 2019, following a\nmulti-vehicle collision, and he was charged with aggravated DUI resulting in great bodily \nharm. Applicant said the accident was not his fault. (Tr. 71) The accident was at about \n10:46 p.m. (GE 4 at 19) He said he only had one drink, and that was about 4:45 p.m. \nwhen he was at dinner. (Tr. 71) The accident occurred at about 10 p.m. (Tr. 71) One \nreport said he had a breathalyzer which registered .075 (no time specified in the report); \nhowever, his breathalyzer at 12:14 am said .054. (Tr. 74, 86-87; GE 4 at 2, 18-19) \n \nApplicant said they tested urine samples in the jail, and they found cocaine \nmetabolites in his urinalysis sample; however, he disagreed with this finding. (Tr. 76, 101) \nHe was taking Adderall for ADHD, and it was not detected in the test. (Tr. 76-77) He \nbelieved they switched his urine sample with one of the other prisoners. (Tr. 101) Forty-\neight hours after he was arrested, he had a blood test, which was negative for the cocaine \nmetabolite. (Tr. 103, 106) I asked Applicant to provide a copy of the blood test results \nafter his hearing; however, he did not provide them. (Tr. 116) \nApplicant was arrested for failure to appear on March 6, 2023, and he was released \non March 13, 2023. (Tr. 79-80, 96) Applicant pleaded guilty to DUI in order to get released \nfrom jail. (Tr. 82) He was placed on probation for 18 months. (Tr. 109) He intends to \nappeal his conviction. (Tr. 82) He was unaware of the status of the civil lawsuit the woman \nseriously injured in the accident filed against him. (Tr. 83; GE 5) \nApplicant told the police officer he drank a double vodka at about 5:00 p.m., and \nhe said he had not smoked marijuana in the previous three days. (Tr. 86; GE 4 at 19) \nThe woman who was seriously injured in the accident on July 22, 2019, was \npregnant. In her lawsuit, she seeks damages from Applicant in the amount of $50,000. \n(GE 4) The lawsuit states Applicant was under the influence of alcohol and/or marijuana \nat the time of the accident. \nApplicant was arrested or served with papers in the summer of 2022 for not paying \nhis child support. (Tr. 60, 68) He said, \u201cthey put me in jail twice to pay child support in a \ntotal amount of $9,000 one time, and then $6,000 the next time. So, that\u2019s $15,000. So, \nhow could I possibly owe them anything?\u201d (Tr. 59) The hearing is supposed to clarify the \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \namount of his child support payments, and possibly designate who should take the \ndeductions for the children for income tax purposes.

(Tr. 60) \nPersonal Conduct-Falsification of SCA \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.b, 4.c, and 4.d allege Applicant failed to disclose on his April 23, 2020 \nSCA the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, and 3.b in response to questions \nabout felony charges, charges involving alcohol and illegal drugs, and involvement with \nmarijuana in the previous seven years. \nIn his April 23, 2020 SCA, Applicant disclosed: his 2017 or 2018 domestic violence \ncharges which was dismissed; his emergency order of protection in 2019 was denied; his \naggravated DUI charge in 2019 was pending; and he was accused of violation of \nparenting order or plan in 2020 (GE 1 at 32-39) He did not disclose any alcohol offenses \nexcept the 2019 DUI or any drug offenses or involvement in response to the specific \nquestions about alcohol-related charges and drug involvement. (GE 1) \nOn November 4, 2019, Applicant confirmed to an OPM investigator that his only \narrest for or charge of DUI was in 2019, and he did not have any drug-related charges. \n(OPM ROI at 6) He was confronted with and confirmed marijuana possession charges in \n1995, 2003, and 2011. (Id. at 6-9; SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, and 1.i) He confirmed: his 1997 DUI \narrest and conviction in 2000, and his arrest in 1998, for obstruction of justice/destruction \nof evidence. (OPM ROI at 8; SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h) He indicated he used marijuana from \nAugust 1986 to August 2019, and his average use was three or four times a month. (OPM \nROI at 9) He said he \u201chas never tested positive on a drug test.\u201d (Id. at 10) He told the \nOPM investigator that he believed he was only required to disclose marijuana offenses \nand DUIs in the previous seven years. (Id. at 6-9) In his response to DOHA interrogatories \nhe explained the urinalysis test result showing cocaine metabolites found in his urine \nsample were erroneous, and he predicted the charges would be removed from his \nrecords. (GE 2 at 2) \nAt his hearing, Applicant said he had no idea he was charged with the felonies in \nSOR \u00b6 1.g. (Tr. 89) He misread the question concerning alcohol and drug offenses. (Tr. \n90-91) He thought he only had to disclose the offenses in the last seven years. (Tr. 90-\n91) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \u201cThe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of \nthe Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Direct or objective evidence of nexus \nis not required.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial\nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.

See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).

He pleaded guilty to possession of marijuana, \na lesser-included misdemeanor offense. He was sentenced to 12 months of probation \nbefore judgment and ordered to pay fines and court costs totaling $921. \nSOR \u00b6 1.h. Applicant was arrested on December 21, 1997, and he was charged \nwith DUI, driving on a suspended or revoked driver\u2019s license, and operating an uninsured \nmotor vehicle.

Applicant was arrested on August 22, 1998, and he was charged with \nobstruction of justice/destruction of evidence and attempted false report of an offense, \nboth felonies. He was convicted of these offenses and sentenced to 11 months of \nprobation and assessed fines and court costs totaling $250. Applicant said he \nremembered being arrested after he swore at a police officer; however, he claimed could \nnot recall ever going to court or being charged with the offenses. Somehow he was found \nguilty and he \u201cnever knew about it again until [he] went through this investigation process \nright here.\u201d Applicant failed to prove that he was not convicted of the offenses. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e.

Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is in the \nmitigating section infra. \nAG \u00b6 23 details conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nOn December 21, 1997, he was charged with DUI, driving on a suspended or \nrevoked driver\u2019s license, and operating an uninsured motor vehicle.

He continues to be on probation. \nSecurity clearance cases are difficult to compare, especially under Guideline G, \nbecause the facts, degree, and timing of the alcohol abuse and rehabilitation show many \ndifferent permutations. The DOHA Appeal Board has determined in cases of substantial \nalcohol abuse that AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and 23(b) did not mitigate security concerns unless there \nwas a fairly lengthy period of abstaining from alcohol consumption or responsible alcohol \nconsumption. See ISCR Case No. 06-17541 at 3-5 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2008); ISCR Case \nNo. 06-08708 at 5-7 (App. Bd. Dec. 17, 2007); ISCR Case No. 04-10799 at 2-4 (App. Bd. \nNov. 9, 2007). See also ISCR Case No. 08-04232 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2009) (affirming denial \nof security clearance for Applicant with alcohol-related criminal offenses for six years prior \nto hearing). In ISCR Case No. 18-02526 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2019), the Appeal Board \nemphasized the lack of an established benchmark period of abstinence from alcohol \nconsumption stating: \nAs we have previously stated, the Directive does not specify how much time \nmust pass to mitigate the various types of misconduct identified in the \nadjudicative guidelines. Contrary to the Judge\u2019s conclusion, the Board has \nrepeatedly declined to establish a \u201cbenchmark\u201d or \u201cbright-line\u201d rule for \nevaluating the recency of misconduct. The extent to which security \nconcerns have become mitigated through the passage of time is a question \nthat must be resolved based on the evidence as a whole. \nId. at 3 (citing ISCR Case No. 18-01926 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 20, 2019) (reversing grant \nof security clearance for applicant with three alcohol-related driving incidents with most \nrecent occurring in 2017)). \nI have carefully considered the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence on alcohol \nconsumption and Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol consumption. The evidence against full \nmitigation is more persuasive at this time. Insufficient time has elapsed since his July 22, \n2019 DUI to enable a reasonable predictive judgment that his maladaptive use of alcohol \nis safely in the past. He has not presented evidence of alcohol-related counseling or \ntherapy after the 2019 DUI.

Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) any substance misuse (see above definition)\u201d; and \u201c(c) \nillegal possession of a controlled substance. . . .\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and \n25(c).

His 2019 DUI resulted in serious injury to \na pregnant woman. Applicant\u2019s behavior adversely affects his \u201cpersonal, professional, \nand community standing.\u201d See AG \u00b616(e). \nOn November 4, 2019, Applicant confirmed to an OPM investigator that his only \narrest for or charge of DUI was in 2019, and he did not have any drug-related charges. \n(OPM ROI at 6) He was confronted with and confirmed marijuana possession charges in \n1995, 2003, and 2011. (Id. at 6-9; SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, and 1.i) He confirmed: his 1997 DUI \narrest and conviction in 2000, and his arrest in 1998, for obstruction of justice/destruction \nof evidence. (OPM ROI at 8; SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h) He indicated he used marijuana from \nAugust 1986 to August 2019, and his average use was three or four times a month. (OPM \nROI at 9) He told the OPM investigator that he believed he was only required to disclose \nmarijuana offenses and DUIs in the previous seven years. (Id. at 6-9) \nApplicant failed to disclose his three marijuana possession charges, his DUI \ncharge in 1997, and his felony-level arrest in 1998 and subsequent conviction. At his \nhearing, he said he was unaware of the disposition of the 1998 offense. He said he \nthought the marijuana and DUI charges which he failed to disclose were more than seven \nyears before he completed his April 23, 2020 SCA. \nThe Appeal Board has explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, \nstating: \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has \nthe burden of proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, \ndoes not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the \nomission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record evidence as \na whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence \nconcerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission \noccurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E \nand the burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present \nevidence to explain the omission. \n \n14 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 \n(App. Bd. June 9, 2004)). Applicant failed to disclose multiple offenses on his SCA, and \nthe burden shifted to Applicant to explain the omissions. \nApplicant failed to honestly and candidly disclose negative information. His claims \nthat he did not know about the disposition of the 1998 felony-level offense are not credible. \nThe OPM interview in 2019 highlighted the issue of drug involvement and alcohol abuse \noffenses not being limited to those occurring within seven years of completion of the SCA. \nI do not believe he honestly believed he did not have to disclose alcohol and drug offenses \nif they were more than seven years before completion of his SCA. \nApplicant denied at his hearing that he knowingly and intentionally fabricated his \nSCA with intent to deceive. I do not find his denials to be credible. His false denials show \na lack of rehabilitation and weigh against mitigation of the personal conduct security \nconcerns. None of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Personal conduct security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines G, H, \nJ, and E are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 50-year-old chief of software architecture for a defense contractor. \nHe has several information technology certifications. He has worked for the same \nemployer for 13 years. There is no evidence of security violations, improper disclosure of \nclassified information, or that Applicant compromised national security. See ISCR Case \nNo. 18-02581 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020) (noting admissibility of \u201cgood security record,\u201d \nand commenting that security concerns may nevertheless not be mitigated). \n15 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe evidence against mitigation is more persuasive. Applicant\u2019s six criminal \noffenses show a pattern of poor judgment. He is on probation for his 2019 DUI offense \nwhich involved serious injury. He possessed and used marijuana on numerous occasions \nfrom August 1986 to at least August 2019. He intentionally failed to disclose information \nof security significance on his April 23, 2020 SCA. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person. Applicant failed to mitigate alcohol consumption, criminal \nconduct, drug involvement, and personal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b through 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d and 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g, 1.h, and 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \nSubparagraphs 3.a and 3.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 4.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 4.b, 4.c, and 4.d: \nAgainst Applicant \n16 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information.

He mentioned at dinner \nthat if they did divorce and he remarried, he would want someone younger, about the \nintern\u2019s age, and one who already had children, so that he would not have to start all \nover again.

I find that the company\u2019s investigation into his \nconduct is more reliable than Applicant, and that he committed the conduct alleged in \nthe report of the investigation. \nApplicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy case in March 2008. He completed the \nplan, and his remaining dischargeable debts were discharged in June 2013. His wife \nfiled her own Chapter 7 bankruptcy case in about 2011, and her debts were also \ndischarged.

Under \nSchedule E/F, Creditors Who Have Unsecured Claims, the petition listed $2,357 owed \nto the IRS and $153,180 owed to other creditors. The petition listed that both Applicant \nand his wife were unemployed, with $2,098 from his Department of Veterans Affairs \n(VA) disability benefits as their only income. Their monthly expenses were also \ncalculated at $2,098. Their dischargeable debts were discharged in November 2019. \n(Tr. at 122; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 6) \nApplicant had financial problems before he was terminated from his job in July \n2019. He had $2,357 in unpaid federal taxes for tax year 2015. He and his wife bought \ntwo new vehicles in 2017 with loans for both vehicles with balances that still totaled \nabout $80,000 when the bankruptcy petition was filed. It was reported in May 2019 that \na credit union filed a lawsuit against him for more than $10,000 for an unpaid credit \ncard. He retained a debt relief company to assist him in resolving about $28,000 to \n$30,000 in credit card debt. He asserted that he did not realize that the company was \nnot paying his debts. Also, his wife was spending beyond what they could afford. (Tr. at \n25-26, 50, 122-135, 145-149; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3, 4) \nApplicant\u2019s tax debt for 2015 was paid in February 2020, when $2,298 was \nwithheld from his refund for 2019 and applied to the taxes owed for 2015. (GE 3) His \ncurrent finances appear stable. His most recent credit report does not list any delinquent \ndebts. It lists $34,167 in federal student loans that are paused due to COVID relief, and \nan auto loan that was opened in September 2022 with a high balance of $86,385, with \nmonthly payments of $1,580 for 83 months and a balance of $83,831. The most recent \nbalance was $81,758. He stated that the amount is high because he traded in his late \nwife\u2019s vehicle, and it had about $15,000 in negative equity that was rolled into the new \nloan. He initially testified this was the only vehicle he purchased since the bankruptcy. \nHe then admitted that he and his late wife bought and sold an additional three vehicles \nsince the bankruptcy. He now has the new vehicle and another vehicle that is owned \nwithout a loan or lien.

(Applicant\u2019s response to SOR) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \nclearance investigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any\nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse\ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information,\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the\nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information.\nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer\u2019s time or resources; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nI am unable to find by substantial evidence that Applicant committed disqualifying \npersonal conduct as alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.f. Those allegations are \nconcluded for Applicant. \nI am satisfied by substantial evidence that the job terminations alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.e and 1.g resulted from Applicant\u2019s inappropriate conduct. He admitted to the \nplagiarism alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. \nApplicant adamantly denied he committed any of the conduct that resulted in his \n2019 termination (SOR \u00b6 1.h). As addressed above, I did not find Applicant credible. \nThe company found that two employees in two different cities had similar complaints \nagainst Applicant. It noted that he denied he engaged in the behavior, but witnesses \nconfirmed the allegations. Additionally, the company found that \u201c[w]itnesses identified by \n[Applicant] that could corroborate he did not engage in this behavior actually \ncorroborated the allegations made by the [complaining employee].\u201d I find that the \ncompany\u2019s report of the investigation into Applicant\u2019s conduct is more reliable than \nApplicant, and that he committed the conduct alleged in that report. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct reflects questionable judgment and an unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. The conduct also created vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d) and 16(e) are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant failed to accept responsibility for his conduct. I find he was untruthful \nthroughout the security clearance process, including during the hearing. The older \nallegations might be mitigated if I had found him credible, but I did not. Falsus in uno, \nfalsus in omnibus (false in one thing, false in everything) is not necessarily true, but it is \nsufficient to give pause and leave lingering doubts in a close case. Applicant\u2019s conduct \ncontinues to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nNone of the above mitigating conditions are applicable. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including a Chapter 13 bankruptcy \ncase and a Chapter 7 bankruptcy case. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant completed his Chapter 13 bankruptcy case in 2013. That allegation is \nmitigated. His debts were discharged in 2019 through a Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The \nGovernment is not precluded from considering the negative security implications of an \napplicant\u2019s overall history of financial difficulties merely because the applicant exercises \nthe right to seek a discharge of debts in bankruptcy. See, e.g., ISCR Case 08-00435 at \n3 (App. Bd. Jan. 22, 2009). \nApplicant attributed the Chapter 7 bankruptcy to the loss of his job in 2019. That \nevent was caused by his conduct and was not beyond his control. Additionally, he had \nsignificant financial problems before he lost his job, including unpaid taxes from 2015. \nThe Chapter 7 bankruptcy was filed only a few weeks after he lost the job, but the \npetition included a mortgage loan, two auto loans, and $153,180 owed to unsecured \ncreditors. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not applicable. \nChapter 7 bankruptcy is a legal means of addressing one\u2019s burdensome debts, \nbut it does not constitute a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts within the meaning of AG \u00b6 20(d). See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at \n3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, \n2001)). AG \u00b6 20(d) is not applicable. \nApplicant\u2019s tax debt for 2015 was paid in February 2020, when $2,298 was \nwithheld from his refund for 2019 and applied to the taxes owed for 2015. His current \nfinances appear stable, but there are warning signs. He has an auto loan with a balance \nof more than $80,000 for a vehicle he bought last year. He initially testified this was the \nonly vehicle he purchased since the bankruptcy. He then admitted that he and his late \nwife bought and sold an additional three vehicles since the bankruptcy. He now has the \nnew vehicle and another vehicle that is owned without a loan or lien. It is unclear why he \nand his 13-year-old child have two vehicles. His financial issues are recent. They \ncontinue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I \nam not convinced that financial problems are completely behind him.

AG \u00b6 20(c) is partially applicable. Financial considerations security concerns \nremain despite the presence of some mitigation. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E and F in my whole-person analysis. I considered \nApplicant\u2019s honorable military service, favorable character evidence, and that he is a \ndisabled veteran. I also considered that I did not find Applicant credible and that he was \ndishonest throughout the security clearance process. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the personal conduct and financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

(Tr. 16-21) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant is indebted to the federal government for \ndelinquent federal income taxes, The allegations (Sugg) are supported by tax transcripts \nfrom December 2021.

(GE 1) \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in April 2021. He told the \ninvestigator that he owed taxes for every tax year since his divorce because he did not \nhave enough money to pay them. He said he was not earning enough, and he was \nfinancially overextended. He said he paid his tax bill through 2016, but still owed 2017 \nthrough 2020.

He did not have enough money withheld from his income to cover his tax \ndebt. This continued for tax years 2012 and 2013. It is unknown if he owed federal income \ntaxes for tax year 2014. Each subsequent tax year he owed taxes and was unable to pay. \nHe attributed it to having a new house, three children and their expenses, and his 2014 \ndivorce. (Tr. 26-28 \nApplicant testified that in 2012 he hired an accountant to prepare his tax returns, \nwhich were electronically filed. He had no explanation for why he did not pay them or \nchange his withholdings each year to cover the amount he would owe. He said he did not \ndiscuss it with his accountant. Each year, he would drop off his tax information to his \naccountant who would prepare his returns. Applicant would sign the returns, and they \nwould be filed electronically. He was aware he owed taxes each year and received notices \nfrom the IRS. He did not pay his taxes, and he did not execute a payment plan with the \nIRS. (Tr. 35-41) \nApplicant provided tax transcripts from December 2022 for tax years 2015, 2016, \n2017, and 2018, which show he has a zero-balance owed for each year. He only provided \nthe first two pages of the transcripts, so the tax history is unknown. For tax years 2019 he \nowes $4,287 and 2020 he owes $7,067. Applicant testified that he also owes taxes for \ntax year 2021 of about $6,000. He estimated he would owe about the same amount of \n$6,000 for tax year 2022, which was not due at the time of his hearing. (AE B-G) \nApplicant testified that he also did not pay his taxes in 2012 and 2013 because he \nwas going through a divorce, he had a new house, and he had expenses associated with \nhis children, such as the prom. During their marriage, his wife worked full-time. He \ndivorced in 2014 and he was not required to pay spousal support. His ex-wife waived her \nright to receive 50% of his military retirement pay. He received the house in the divorce \nsettlement and was not required to pay her any of the equity in the house. They split the \njoint debts where he paid 70% and she paid 30%. He said after his divorce he was \ndepressed, overwhelmed, and shut down mentally. He received notices from the IRS in \nthe mail about his delinquent taxes and the amount owed.

(AE A) \nThe SOR alleged a charged-off account for a repossessed vehicle in the amount \nof $12,744. Applicant cosigned a car loan for his daughter in 2014. She failed to pay the \nloan. He returned the vehicle to the creditor. He did not follow up on the debt until after \nhe spoke with the government investigator and then he contacted the creditor.

In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be\ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other\nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental\nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to\nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.\nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including\nespionage. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis concern encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and \nother qualities essential to protecting classified information. A person who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, \n2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely pay his 2015 through 2020 federal income taxes and \nowed approximately $24,039 in delinquent taxes. Despite being on notice from the IRS \nthat he owed federal income taxes each year, he failed to pay them each year because \nhe prioritized other bills, even after his income increased. In his 2020 SCA, he said he \nwas going to start paying the taxes by the end of the year. He did not. After receiving the \nSOR, he made some payments to the IRS and later entered into an installment agreement \nin 2022. He also had a charged-off debt from 2014 for a vehicle repossessed with a \nbalance of $12,744. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant repeatedly failed to pay his federal income taxes from 2015 through \n2020, as alleged. He continued this pattern for tax year 2021 and did not anticipate timely \npaying his 2022 federal income taxes. His debts are recent and ongoing and his conduct \ncasts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.

He also said he was depressed. His divorce was beyond his control. Being \nresponsible for house payments and his children was within his control and are normal \nexpenses associated with having a family. He chose to pay his children\u2019s student loans \ninstead of his taxes. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. He was on notice each year when he completed \nhis tax returns that he owed taxes. He was not proactive in changing his withholdings. He \nrepeated his pattern of failing to pay his taxes on time for six years as alleged in the SOR. \nHe told the government investigator that he would begin repaying the taxes by the end of \n2020. He then failed to timely pay his 2021 federal income taxes, which is not alleged. It \nwas not until he received the SOR in January 2022 that he made payments. In February \n2022 he entered into an installment agreement with the IRS. He anticipated he would owe \nfederal income taxes for 2022 and would not timely pay them. He stated he would add \nthe amount owed to his outstanding balance. This does not portray responsible conduct. \nThere is insufficient evidence to find that Applicant\u2019s tax issues were totally beyond his \ncontrol or that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal \napplication. \nApplicant has not received financial counseling and there is not clear evidence that \nhis financial problems are under control. There is evidence that Applicant has had an \ninstallment agreement with the IRS since February 2022, and he is in compliance. \nHowever, he does not have a reliable financial track record of satisfying his yearly tax \nobligation, which may jeopardize his current agreement. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) does not apply. AG \n\u00b6 20(g) applies. \nThe fact that Applicant has an installment agreement and has made payments \n\u201cdoes not preclude careful consideration of Applicant\u2019s security worthiness based on \nlongstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility.\u201d ISCR Case No. 12-05053 (App. \nBd.

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1)\nthe nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant\u2019s history of non-compliance with a fundamental legal obligation to timely \npay his federal income taxes raises serious concerns. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g: \nFor Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Lynch, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n11/22/2023 \nDecision \nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from the guidelines for \ndrug involvement and personal conduct. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \nStatement of Case \nOn September 10, 2019, Applicant certified and \nsigned Electronic \nQuestionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain or retain a security \nclearance required for employment with a defense contractor. On March 10, 2021, he \nprovided a personal summary interview (PSI) to an investigator from the Office \nPersonnel Management (OPM). After examining the background investigation, the \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (the DoD CAF, predecessor \nto \nthe \nDefense \nCounterintelligence \nSecurity \nAgency \n(DCSA), \nConsolidated \nAdjudications Services (CAS)) could not make the affirmative findings necessary to \nissue a security clearance. On April 11, 2022, the DCSA CAS issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under the guidelines for drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse (Guideline H), and personal conduct (Guideline E). \nThe action was taken pursuant to Security Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in \n1 \n\n \nAppendix A the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for \nAccess to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), made \neffective in the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nOn April 26, 2022, Applicant furnished an answer to the SOR. The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on May 22, 2023, for \na hearing on June 23, 2023. The hearing was held by Teams video teleconference as \nscheduled. I entered the Government\u2019s eight exhibits (GE) 1-8 exhibits into evidence \nwithout objection. Applicant submitted a one-page post-hearing exhibit dated June 27, \n2023. Department Counsel had no objection to the exhibit, and it was received in \nevidence as Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE A). Applicant refers to the prescription as a \n\u201creceipt,\u201d and interprets the date in the center of the exhibit as 12/22, which does not \naccount for the first two digits to the left of 12/22 posted in the exhibit. I believe the \ncomplete date for all six numbers is December 22, 2020. DOHA received the transcript \n(Tr.) on July 3, 2023. The record closed the same day. The page numbers of GE 2 are \nlocated in the lower right-hand corner of each of the 14-page exhibit. \nRulings on Procedure \nAt the conclusion of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to strike SOR \u00b6 \n2.e because Applicant did not have a security clearance on September 10, 2019, when \nhe certified the e-QIP. (GE 8 at 1; Tr. 64-65) The allegation is withdrawn from the SOR. \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend SOR \u00b6 1.b by changing the date and \nyear in the allegation from 2016 to September 26, 2019. Applicant had no objection to \nthe amendment. (GE 8 at 1; Tr. 65-66) This amendment is authorized under E3.1.17. of \nDoD Directive 5220.6, so that the SOR conforms with the evidence of record. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges under paragraph 1.a that Applicant used marijuana at \ndifferent frequencies from 2002 to the present; that he used marijuana with a security \nclearance since September 2019; that he tested positive for marijuana metabolites in \n2005 and 2008; and, that he was arrested in 2010 having marijuana in his possession, \nand in 2012 by violating the terms of his 2010 probation because he had marijuana in \nhis possession. \nThe second paragraph of the SOR alleges personal conduct by incorporating \nthe information alleged under SOR \u00b6 1. The SOR alleges that Applicant committed \nsexual acts on a minor in 2005, and made a false statement, in violation of four Articles \nof the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). He also falsified information in three \nlocations on his September 2019 e-QIP. The Applicant admitted all allegations listed in \nthe SOR, without explanations. \n2 \n\n \nApplicant is 39 years old and has been divorced since February 2015. He has a \nson from his former wife. His current girlfriend gave birth to a two-year-old daughter in\n2021. He received a security clearance in 2019 when he began working for his then\nemployer. From June 2002 to November 2002, he served in the United States (U.S.)\nArmy on active duty. From November 2002 to September 2004, he served in the Army\nReserve, and received an honorable discharge. He returned to active duty in the U.S\nArmy from September 2004 to December 2009, when he received a general discharge\nunder honorable conditions for drug-related conduct and positive drug tests. He has\nbeen living in Country B since 2014. Applicant seeks security clearance eligibility. In\nAugust 2018, he began working as a senior logistic specialist, and was recently\npromoted to a senior analyst of stock control. (GE 1 at 9-28; GE 2 at 7; Tr. 7-8, 35, 38-\n39, 40) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a \u2013 Applicant testified that he has been using marijuana from 2002 to \nthe present. Since 2012 or 2013, he has been using marijuana to relax his urethra when \nhe urinates. In 2022, he began obtaining the marijuana by prescription because Country \nB legalized marijuana use. Before the drug was legalized, he obtained the drug illegally \nfrom family and friends. In his March 2021 PSI, he indicated he was paying between \n$250 and $300 a month or every other month for the drug. He noted that the purchase \nand use of marijuana was legal in Country B. Applicant\u2019s last drug treatment or \ncounseling was in 2022, when a doctor, featuring alternative treatment methods, \nprovided him with a prescription for marijuana. (GE 2 at 7; Tr. 20, 23, 43, 45, 47) \nApplicant\u2019s girlfriend uses marijuana occasionally. His longest period of \nabstinence was in 2007 for four and one-half months while in the U.S. Army. He has \nnever violated the laws of Country B. (Tr. 56-58) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b \u2013 Applicant used marijuana after he was granted an interim security \nclearance on September 26, 2019, which was removed when he received the SOR in \nApril 2022. From 2015 through 2018, Applicant believed he had a public trust position. \n(GE 8 at 1; 34-37) \nIn his March 2021 PSI, Applicant stated that he intended to stop using \nmarijuana before his daughter was born in June 2021. He did not want his marijuana \nuse to impair his chances of promotion. (GE 2 at 8) He changed his mind because of his \nongoing urethra problem causing difficulty urinating. He uses marijuana weekly or \nwhenever he needs the drug. He does not drive a car within three hours of marijuana \nuse. He testified that he has not driven to work for two or three years since he has been \nin treatment for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from nerve damage in his \nscrotum since surgery in 2006. (Tr. 43-47) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c \u2013 Applicant tested positive for marijuana metabolites on a U.S. \nArmy urinalysis, conducted on March 16, 2005. Following a field grade Article 15, he \nwas found guilty by his command of wrongful possession and use of a controlled \n3 \n\n \n \nsubstance in violation of the UCMJ, reduced in rank, assigned to 45 extra days of duty, \nand 45 days restriction. \nApplicant believed that the 2005 positive drug test, and subsequent Article 15, \nwere caused by fellow service member rolling hash-laced cigars that Applicant smoked \ndaily for three or four months. He was not used to the hash smell, but he determined \nthat the smoke produced was not ordinary cigar smoke. He recalled relaxing after he \nsmoked the hash. (GE 2 at 6-7; Tr.22) \nOn April 6, 2005, Applicant tested positive for marijuana metabolites. (GE 4 at \n2; Tr. 48) This urinalysis is not alleged in the SOR, and cannot be used for \ndisqualification purposes, but will be evaluated in the whole-person review of this case. \n(Tr. 22) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d \u2013 On August 27, 2008, Applicant tested positive for marijuana \nmetabolites. After field grade Article 15, he was found guilty. The conditions of his \nArticle 15 punishment were the same as those identified in SOR \u00b6 1.c. He believed the \npositive drug test was caused by the hemp tea he was using to relax his urethra, but he \nprovided no evidence to support his claim. He received a general discharge from the \nU.S. Army in December 2009 for his drug use. He subsequently received an upgraded \nhonorable discharge. (GE 2 at 7; Tr. 52-54) \nSOR 1.e \u2013 Applicant was arrested with possession of marijuana in September \n2010. The police came to his residence and smelled marijuana. He was found guilty, \nfined, and placed on a period of at least two years of probation. (GE 2 at 7; Tr. 54) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f \u2013 In March 2012, Applicant was driving with his brother to another \nlocation to celebrate the return of a friend from overseas when he was stopped by the \npolice for a traffic infraction. The police found marijuana in the car. Applicant\u2019s claim that \nhe was not driving is refuted by documentation that indicates he was driving on a \nsuspended or revoked license. (GE 3 at 8) He was charged with violating his probation \nimposed in the SOR \u00b6 1.e sentence. For the probation violation, he was sentenced to \ntwo weeks in jail, a fine of $1,776, and an unidentified number of hours of community \nservice. (GE 2 at 7) \nSOR \u00b6 2.b \u2013 in December 2005, Applicant was driving three other service \nmembers to a pool party. The same four individuals left the party with a 16-year-victim \nthat Applicant assumed was 18 or older. One of the occupants in the car agreed to take \nthe victim home if she performed fellatio on all four occupants. (Tr. 27) After the sexual \nactivity, they dropped her off at a gas station that had cameras in various locations. The \nU.S. Army Criminal Investigative Division (CID) reviewed the videos, and a month or \ntwo later, summoned Applicant to the CID station. Applicant was interrogated about the \nincident, and he initially lied to protect the other three service members from military \npunishment under Article 15. During a second interrogation, Applicant divulged the \ncomplete account of sexual activity. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was charged with Forced Sodomy, Indecent Acts Upon a Child, a \nFalse Statement, and Conspiracy, in violation of Articles 125, 134, 107, and 81 of the \nUCMJ. Following a summary court-martial, he was found guilty of the offenses, ordered \nto forfeit $1,128, and assigned to 45 days extra duty. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c and 2.d refer to Applicant\u2019s falsifications of material facts on his \nSeptember 2019 e-QIP. First, in response to Section 22 (SOR \u00b6 2.c), he answered that \nhe had never been involved in an offense involving alcohol or drugs, deliberately failing \nto disclose the information set forth in SOR \u00b61.e. Second, in response to Section 23 (\u00b6 \n2.d), Applicant answered that he had not illegally used drugs in the past seven years, \ndeliberately failing to disclose the information set forth in SOR \u00b6 1.a. He told the OPM \ninvestigator in March 2021, that he had no explanation for not disclosing the \ninformation. (GE 2 at 7) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines, which should be applied \nwith common sense and the general factors of the whole-person concept. All available \nand reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, \nshould be carefully reviewed before rendering a decision. The protection of the national \nsecurity is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning \npersonnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the \nnational security.\u201d Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \napplicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d \nThe applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security \ndecision. \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern under the Drug Involvement/Substance Abuse Guideline \nis set forth in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \n5 \n\n \nrules, and regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled \nsubstance\" as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the \ngeneric term adopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors \nlisted above. \nIn my analysis of this case, I have taken administrative notice of Executive \nOrder (E.O.) 12564 signed by the then-President of the United States on September 15, \n1986. The primary positions addressed in the E.O. are: (1) federal employees cannot \nuse illegal drugs; (2) illegal drug use by federal employees, on or off duty, is contrary to \nthe efficiency of the service; and (3) persons who use illegal drugs are not suitable for \nfederal employment. \nI have also taken administrative notice of the Director of National Intelligence \nMemorandum Adherence of Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use, (October 25, \n2014), Adherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use, which clearly states that \nstate laws do not authorize persons to violate federal law, including the Controlled \nSubstances Act (21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801-971 (1970)), which identifies marijuana as a \nSchedule 1 controlled drug. \nChanges in state laws or the District of Columbia, pertaining to marijuana use \ndo not change the existing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, effective June 8, 2017). An individual\u2019s disregard of the \nfederal law pertaining to marijuana involvement remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations. \nOn December 21, 2021, the Director of National Intelligence signed the \nmemorandum, Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for \nAgencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position. It emphasizes that \nfederal law remains unchanged with respect to illegal use, possession, production, and \ndistribution of marijuana. Disregard of federal law relevant to marijuana (including prior \nrecreational marijuana use) remains relevant, but not determinative to adjudications of \nsecurity clearance eligibility. Agencies are required to employ the \u201cwhole-person \nconcept\u201d stated under SEAD 4, to determine if an applicant\u2019s behavior raises a security \nconcern that has not been mitigated. \nAG \u00b6 25. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; \n6 \n\n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession \nof drug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant\u2019s illegal use of marijuana from 2002 to April 2022, when the SOR was \nissued, meets the definition of AG \u00b6 25(a). He continued to use the drug to two days \nbefore the hearing in June 2023. In order to use the drug, Applicant had to possess it as \ndefined by AG \u00b6 25(c). He tested positive while in the U.S. Army for marijuana \nmetabolites in 2005. Following positive test results for marijuana in 2008, he received a \ngeneral discharge from the U.S. Army in December 2009. SOR \u00b6 25(b) applies. AG \u00b6 \n25(f) does not apply to the public trust position Applicant had on September 10, 2019 \nwhen he signed and certified the e-QIP. However, his illegal use of marijuana after \nreceiving his interim security clearance on September 26, 2019, brings his behavior \nwithin the scope of AG \u00b6 25(f). \nAG \u00b6 26. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were\nused; and \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nApplicant has a history of illegally using marijuana that began in 2002 until \nshortly before the June 2023 hearing. He used marijuana while in the U.S. Army as \nconfirmed by his positive test results in 2005 and 2008. His arrest in 2010 for \npossession of marijuana resulted in a finding of guilty and probation. He violated his \nprobation in 2012 for having marijuana in his car, and driving on a suspended license. \n7 \n\nHe used marijuana after he was granted a security clearance. AG \u00b6 26(a) does not \napply. \nThere is insufficient evidence demonstrating that Applicant has severed his ties \nwith drug associates and the drug environment. AG \u00b6 26(b)(1) and 26(b)(2) do not \napply. Applicant has not submitted a signed statement of intent to forgo future use of all \ndrug involvement, acknowledging that any future use is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. AG \u00b623(b)(3) does not apply. \nThough Applicant admits his involvement with marijuana, he has furnished no \nindependent evidence of action taken to overcome his illegal drug use, with the \nobjective of abstaining from all future drug use. \nPersonal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set forth in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, \nor unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to \nprovide truthful and candid answers during the national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally \nresult in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation or further processing for \nnational security eligibility. \nThe potential disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16 are: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts \nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative areas that is not \nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that he may not properly \nsafeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \n8 \n\ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. This includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of \nclient \nconfidentiality, release \nof \nproprietary information, \nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or government \nprotected information \u2026 \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources. \nApplicant\u2019s drug involvement has independent significance under AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) \nand 16(d)(3) because it demonstrates questionable judgment and an unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \nThe adverse information identified under SOR \u00b6 1, containing Applicant\u2019s long \nhistory of illegal marijuana use, combined with three positive drug test results over a \nthree-year period, two drug-related arrests in 2010 and 2012, and using marijuana after \nbeing granted a security clearance in September 2019, represents disqualifying \nmisconduct within AG \u00b6 16(c) and 16(d)(3). \nApplicant\u2019s behavior during his participation in the sexual acts in December \n2005 is aggravated by the fact that the victim was a minor. While Applicant claims he \ninitially falsified the facts concerning misconduct to protect the three other participants, it \nis incipiently apparent that he was trying to avoid potential punishment himself. AG \u00b6 \n16(c) and 16 (d) apply to SOR \u00b6 2(b). \nApplicant\u2019s admitted falsification of material facts from his September 2019 e-\nQIP was deliberate. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c and 2.d. \nAG \u00b6 17. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it \n9 \n\nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply. The condition requires a prompt, good-faith effort to \ncorrect the omission before being confronted. Applicant revealed his drug involvement \nin March 2021 after he was confronted with the earlier omissions in his September 2019 \ne-QIP. Considering the evidence in its totality, Applicant\u2019s disclosure of his overall drug \nuse was neither prompt nor made in good faith. \nApplicant\u2019s falsification in September 2019 of his arrest in 2010 for an offense \ninvolving alcohol or drugs was not minor. Applicant\u2019s lack of candor about his criminal \nhistory is always important to a security investigation as is Applicant\u2019s illegal use of \ndrugs in the last 7 years. Considering the evidence as a whole, AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) \ndo not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI \nhave \nexamined \nthe \nevidence \nunder \nthe \nguideline \nfor \ndrug \ninvolvement/substance misuse in the context of the nine general factors of the whole-\nperson concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant is 39 years old. He has an eight-year-old son and a two-year-old \ndaughter. He has been working for his employer since 2020. He began as a data \nanalyst and was recently promoted to senior analyst of stock control. \n10 \n\n____________ \nThe favorable evidence supporting security eligibility is insufficient to overcome \nthe countervailing evidence. Applicant has illegally used marijuana since 2002. Holding \na security clearance is a 24-hour-responsibilty which requires complying with all federal \nlaws at work and after work, even when the clearance is inactive, and regardless of the \namount of classified information the holder may handle at a given time. Even though \nsome states and Country B have decriminalized marijuana use, it is still illegal at the \nfederal level for federal contract employees, even though they may be working in a \ncountry outside of the United States and their marijuana use may be legal and \nprescribed in that country. Applicant\u2019s decision to keep using marijuana was stronger \nthan his desire to stop using the drug when his daughter was born in June 2021. \nMedical marijuana assigns no special status under the adjudicative guidelines. See, \nISCR Case No. 20-02794 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb.1, 2022) After weighing the entire record \nunder the whole person, including his deliberate falsifications of his September 2019 e-\nQIP, Applicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation does not overcome the security concerns raised \nby the drug involvement and personal conduct guidelines. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-f: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.e: \nWithdrawn \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interest of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nPaul J. Mason \nAdministrative Judge \n11 \n",

(Item \n8 at 4) This investigation was precipitated after the payee was issued a check, but did not \nreceive it. She contacted the maker of the check, the U.S. Treasury.  Subsequently, the \nU.S. Treasury placed a trace on the check, which revealed that it had been deposited in \nApplicant\u2019s account. (Item 8 at 5) Although Applicant denied the allegations and was \nnever prosecuted, an investigation concluded that there was probable cause establishing \nall the offenses. (Item 8 at 4) \nBetween 2002 and 2014, Applicant incurred approximately $9,500 of delinquent \ndebt, including two judgments, totaling approximately $7,800, as alleged in SOR \nsubparagraphs 1c. and 1.d, and a tax warrant, totaling approximately $2,700, as alleged \nin subparagraph 1.e. In 2014, Applicant filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection, as \nalleged in SOR subparagraph 1.f. (Item 8) Later that year, the court discharged \napproximately $48,000 in delinquent debt. (Item 9 at 8) The judgment alleged in SOR \nsubparagraph 1.d was discharged through the bankruptcy, and Applicant satisfied the tax \nwarrant in 2015. (Item 2 at 1) It is unclear from the record whether the judgment alleged \nin SOR subparagraph 1.c was discharged in the 2014 bankruptcy. \nSince the bankruptcy discharge, Applicant has incurred approximately $85,000 of \nadditional delinquent debt alleged in SOR subparagraphs 1.g through 1.m. These debts \ninclude subparagraph 1.g, a $29,632 child support delinquency, subparagraph 1.h, a \n$14,682 medical account, delinquent credit card accounts totaling $624, as alleged in \nsubparagraphs 1i. and 1.j, and three automobile-related debts, totaling approximately \n$40,000, alleged in subparagraphs 1.k through 1.m. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe delinquent child support alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.g, is for his youngest \nchild who was born in 2016 after a brief extramarital relationship.

(Item 15 at 2) The \nautomobile-related debts consist of the deficiencies remaining from two repossessions in \n2021, as alleged in subparagraphs 1.k and 1.l, and a delinquent car payment, as alleged \nin subparagraph 1.m. Applicant provided no evidence that he was satisfying any of the \nSOR debts, or that he had made payment arrangements for any of the SOR debts. In his \nanswer, he stated that he \u201cadmit[s] [he] has not made sound financial decisions [sic] in \n[his] life, but [his] commentment [sic] to this country has always stayed strong.\u201d (Item 1 at \n4) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . ..\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine \nadjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18)  \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant satisfied the tax warrant, referenced in SOR subparagraph 1.e, eight \nyears ago. I resolve subparagraph 1.e in his favor. The remainder of the allegations are \nsupported by reliable evidence and trigger the application of AG \u00b6 19(a) \u201cinability to satisfy \ndebts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Applicant\u2019s tax \nwarrant in 2011 triggers AG \u00b6 19(f), \u201c. . . failure to pay annual Federal state, or local \nincome tax as required.\u201d \nApplicant acknowledged that he has problems making good financial decisions, \nbut provided no evidence that he is seeking help with this problem, such as financial \ncounseling. Moreover, he provided no evidence that he has satisfied any of the SOR \ndebts, and the fact that his debts recurred after a bankruptcy discharge of more than \n$48,000 indicates that the likelihood of continuation or recurrence of his financial \nproblems remains unacceptably high. Under these circumstances, none of the AG \u00b6 20 \nmitigating conditions apply, and Applicant has failed to mitigate the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the whole-person factors in my analysis of the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions, and they do not warrant a favorable conclusion. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph  1.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f \u2013 1.m: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

DOHA received the hearing transcript on May 1, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant denied all the SOR allegations. He is 41 years old. As of the date of the \nhearing, he was engaged to be married, and he has three children, ages 23, 7, and 3. He \ngraduated from high school in 2000 and earned an associate degree in 2006. He also \nhas received several certifications in information technology. He and his fianc\u00e9e have \nresided together in a rental property since January 2023. (Tr. at 4-5, 7, 9, 12, 28, 45-47, \n55-56, 74; GE 1-3, 7; AE B, F) \nApplicant served in the U.S. military from August 2000 to January 2005, and he \ndeployed to Iraq in 2003. He received a general discharge under honorable conditions \nafter he was administratively discharged for misconduct. Since approximately 2006, he \nhas worked, at times, for various DOD contractors, to include periods in which he worked \noverseas from April 2010 to April 2012 and March 2013 to October 2016. In April 2012, \nthe DOD contractor for whom he had worked overseas since April 2010, issued him a \nwritten reprimand for submitting erroneous time sheets, and terminated him for violating \nthe company\u2019s information technology policy by having unauthorized music on his \ncomputer. In October 2016, another DOD contractor for whom he had worked overseas \nsince August 2015, terminated him due to his inability to obtain a security clearance. He \nsubsequently continued to live overseas until December 2018, when he returned to the \nUnited States. (Tr. at 10-11, 29-47; GE 1-3, 7; AE A, B, F) \nApplicant was unemployed from October 2007 to February 2008, April 2012 to \nMarch 2013, October 2016 to February 2019, and January 2023 to April 2023. He worked \nonly part time, as a delivery driver, from February 2019 to August 2019. Since then, he \nhas worked full time for various employers, and he was hired by his current employer in \nApril 2023. He and his sister also started their own business in April 2023, but they had \nnot yet generated income as of the date of the hearing. He was first granted a security \nclearance in 2000, when he served in the U.S. military, and that clearance was revoked \nin September 2016 when a DOHA administrative judge found that he had failed to mitigate \npersonal conduct security concerns. (Tr. at 5, 10-11, 29-47; GE 1-3, 5-7, 57-59, 74-76; \nAE A, B, F) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had four delinquent consumer debts totaling \n$28,601. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d) It also alleged that he failed to timely file his federal income \ntax returns, as required, for tax years (TY) 2012 through 2018, and that his federal income \ntax returns for TY 2015 through 2018 remained unfiled. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e-1.f) It also alleged \nthat he failed to timely file his state income tax returns, as required, for tax years 2015 \nthrough 2020. (SOR \u00b6 1.g) The SOR allegations are established by Applicant\u2019s October \n2017 and May 2020 SCAs; his undated response to DOHA interrogatories, in which he \nprovided IRS tax account transcripts from January 2022; and credit bureau reports from \nAugust 2021 and July 2022.

He had difficulty finding a tax professional who knew how to \nfile income tax returns on income that he earned overseas. His period of unemployment \nand underemployment, after his security clearance was revoked in 2016, as well as, in \npart, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, were also contributing factors. He also has paid \napproximately $3,000 in legal expenses since 2020 in a custody battle with the mother of \nhis three-year-old child. He obtained the loans and credit card in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d, \nas further discussed below, for living expenses, to include financially supporting his three \nchildren. As of the date of the hearing, he was also preparing financially to become a \ngrandfather, as his 23-year-old was expecting a child. (Tr. at 7-9, 28, 29-86; GE 1-3, 7; \nAE B, D, E, G) \nApplicant hired and worked with a credit education service from approximately May \n2011 to 2015 to help improve his credit. In approximately 2022, he disputed the debts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d to determine their validity. He began working with another credit \neducation service, in approximately February 2023, to repair and improve his credit. He \nalso completed a financial seminar offered by his church in approximately February 2023, \nand he enrolled in another financial class to continue learning about how to manage his \nfinances. (Tr. at 7-9, 48-54, 62-70, 79-86; GE 1-3; AE B, D, E, G) \nFrom approximately 2014 to 2016, Applicant retained and worked with a tax \nprofessional \u201cfor expats,\u201d to file: his \u201c2010 Form 1040 Income <$100,000\u201d for TY 2010 \nthrough 2013; his outstanding federal income tax returns for TY 2014 and 2015; and his \nstate income tax returns for TY 2010 through 2014. In 2021, he attempted to work with \nhis mother\u2019s accountant to file his income tax returns, but that individual was unfamiliar \nwith filing income tax returns for income earned overseas. In May 2023, he retained \nanother tax professional \u201cfor expats\u201d to file his federal income tax returns for TY 2017, \n2020, 2021, and 2022. He did not believe he was required to file his federal or state \nincome tax returns when he was unemployed from 2016 to 2018, and he did not believe \nhe was required to file his state income tax return for TY 2015, when he resided and \nworked overseas. He did not provide any documentation concerning the status of his state \nincome tax returns for TY 2019 and 2020, when he lived and worked in the United States. \n(Tr. at 7-9, 48-54, 62-70, 79-86; GE 1-3; AE B, D, E, G) \nJanuary 2022 IRS tax account transcripts reflect that Applicant did not file his \nfederal income tax returns for tax year (TY) 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2019 until April 2015, \nOctober 2015, December 2015, and May 2020, respectively. The transcripts also reflect \nthat he owes $18,780 and $1,285 in federal taxes for TY 2012 and 2013, respectively. He \nestablished an installment agreement with the IRS in March 2016, but that agreement \nwas no longer in effect as of September 2016, and the balances due on his account were \nnot collectible as of October 2021 \u201cnot due to hardship.\u201d The transcripts also reflect that \nhe had not yet filed his federal income tax returns for TY 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 2020, \nand 2021, and the IRS issued him refunds, in part due to tax relief credits, for TY 2020 \nand 2021 totaling approximately $2,300 and $6,200, respectively.

He and his fianc\u00e9e split their monthly rent of $1,000. After \npaying his monthly living expenses of approximately $1,700, he anticipated that his \nmonthly net remainder would be approximately $2,000 to $3,000.

(Tr. at 29-63, 74-76, 87-88) \nNumerous character references, to include a former supervisor, former coworkers, \nclose friends, and fellow church members, attested to Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, \nreliability, and judgment. (AE C) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nApplicant has a history of not being able to pay his debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) \nare established for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d. Although he filed his federal income tax returns for \nTY 2012 through 2014, he failed to timely do so, as required. He also failed to show that \nhe filed his federal income tax return for TY 2015. For TY 2016, he was employed \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \noverseas until October 2016, so he should have filed at least his federal income tax return \nfor that tax year, yet he failed to show that he has done so. Given his periods of \nunemployment, he likely was not required to file his federal or state income tax returns \nfor TY 2017 and 2018. Since he worked overseas during TY 2015 and 2016, he likely \nwas not required to file his state income tax returns for those tax years either. However, \nhe failed to show that he filed his state income tax returns for TY 2019 and 2020. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(c), and 19(f) for SOR \u00b6 1.e, for TY 2015 and 2016 \nbut not for TY 2017 and 2018 in SOR \u00b6 1.f, and for TY 2019 and 2020 but not for TY \n2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 in SOR \u00b6 1.g. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nCircumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to his financial problems. \nNonetheless, under AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that he acted responsibly \nunder his circumstances. Although untimely, he filed his federal income tax returns for TY \n2012, 2013, 2014 in April 2015, October 2015, and December 2015, respectively, before \nhe received the SOR. I therefore find SOR \u00b6 1.e in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nAs stated above, Applicant failed to show that he filed his federal income tax \nreturns for TY 2015 and 2016. He also failed to show that he filed his state income tax \nreturns for TY 2019 and 2020. Although he planned to contact his creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a through 1.d to negotiate payment plans and resolve these debts, with the help of the \ncredit education service he began working with in February 2023, he failed to provide \ndocumentation to corroborate his efforts.

AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(c), 20(d), and \n20(g) do not apply to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.d, to TY 2015 and 2016 in SOR \u00b6 1.f, and to \nTY 2019 and 2020 in SOR \u00b6 1.g. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant has \nnot mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nFor Applicant for tax years 2017 \nand 2018, and Against Applicant \nfor tax years 2015 and 2016   \nSubparagraph 1.g: \nFor Applicant for tax years 2015, \n2016, 2017, and 2018, and \nAgainst Applicant for tax years \n2019 and 2020 \n7 \n\n \n \n \n Conclusion \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6 1.a and SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.a-4.g, and he denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 3.a, all with explanations. SOR \u00b6 3.b is a cross- allegation that he did not answer, so I consider that he denied it. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 45 years old. He graduated from high school in 1997 and has taken some college classes. He has been married since 2008, and has a son, 18, and a daughter, 15. He served in the U.S. Navy from October 1997 to November 2016. His DD-214 discharge form reflects that he received the Navy and Marine Corps Commendation Medal, Joint Service Achievement Medal, five Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medals, and six Good Conduct Medals, along with appropriate service medals.

Applicant did not \nprovide sufficient evidence to mitigate resulting security concerns under Guideline D \n(sexual conduct) and Guideline J (criminal conduct).

On April 19, 2022, \nfollowing a background investigation, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security \nAgency Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline J (criminal conduct), \nGuideline D (sexual conduct), Guideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline F \n(financial considerations). The CAF issued the SOR under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the Security Executive Agent Directive 4 (SEAD 4) National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG), which became effective on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on May 8, 2022, and requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). The \ncase was assigned to me on June 1, 2023. On July 26, 2023, DOHA issued a notice \nscheduling the hearing for August 31, 2023, with the hearing to occur via video-\nteleconference through an online platform. \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s \nExhibits (AE) A through J. All exhibits were admitted without objection. At the end of the \nhearing, I held the record open until September 15, 2023, to allow Applicant the \nopportunity to submit additional information. He subsequently submitted documents \nmarked as AE K through AE R, all of which are admitted without objection. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on September 12, 2023. The record closed on \nSeptember 15, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6 1.a and SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.a-4.g, \nand he denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 3.a, all with explanations. SOR \u00b6 3.b is a cross-\nallegation that he did not answer, so I consider that he denied it. Applicant\u2019s admissions \nare incorporated into the findings of fact.

He held a clearance in the Navy. (GE 1, GE 5, GE 6, GE 7; Tr. \n10, 34, 46-47, 66-69; AE R) \nIn September 2015, Applicant was a chief petty officer (E-7) on a U.S. Navy \naircraft carrier at sea. Sailors were on a \u201choliday schedule\u201d and were free to watch \nmovies and television. (GE 7 at 2) Applicant and several male sailors were at his work \narea watching a football game. At about 2100 hours, Sailor S (E-3) went to Applicant\u2019s \nwork area to use a computer. Applicant was her mentor at the time. She was wearing \nunauthorized clothing to transit the ship, including Navy physical training sweatpants \nand a t-shirt. (GE 5 at 11; Tr. 39, 48-50, 113) \nWhen Sailor S sat down, Applicant said to her, \u201cWhat happened to [your] ass, \nyou really don\u2019t have any back there.\u201d Other sailors laughed. Moments later, Sailor S \nasked Applicant for some candy he was eating. Applicant asked her, \u201cWhat are you \nexcited about?\u201d, referring to the fact that her breasts were visible beneath her shirt. (GE \n5 at 11) \nApplicant then walked towards Sailor S with the bag of candy. She later told \nNaval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) investigators that he grabbed her right \nbreast while handing her the candy. She said, \u201che laughed when he grabbed my breast \nand the other guys did too.\u201d She pushed his hand away and said, \u201cWhat the f---? Why \nwould you do that?\u201d Sailor S then left, went to her own work center, and wrote Applicant \nan e-mail telling him she found his behavior inappropriate, offensive, and humiliating. \n(GE 5 at 11) \nSailor S reported the matter the next day. NCIS investigators interviewed the \nthree other sailors present that evening and obtained a sworn statement from Applicant. \nOnly one of the sailors could speak to the allegations. Witness 1 said Applicant told \nSailor S to \u201cpull her pants up over her flat ass.\u201d Witness 1 was unable to observe \nwhether Applicant grabbed Sailor S\u2019s breast. (GE 5 at 11; GE 6 at 11-12) \nIn her sworn statement provided to NCIS, Sailor S said she felt humiliated and \nembarrassed on the night in question. She said Applicant began making sexually \ninappropriate comments towards her in about April 2014. She detailed an incident when \nshe was in the hospital and Applicant came to visit her. She said he sat on her bed, ran \nhis fingers through her hair, and called her \u201cbeautiful\u201d and \u201csexy.\u201d She found his \nbehavior offensive but did not report it since she thought of him as a mentor. His \ngrabbing her breast was the catalyst for her report. (GE 5 at 12) She was transferred to \nanother ship following her report. (GE 6 at 3) \nApplicant acknowledged in his own sworn statement to NCIS that he asked \nSailor S, \u201cwhy are your pants sagging around your flat ass?\u201d He also admitted that he \nasked her if she was excited about something because he noticed that her \u201cheadlights \nwere on\u201d (meaning her nipples were showing through her shirt). He said he may have \n\u201cgrazed her breast\u201d while handing her the bag of candy, but he told NCIS that any \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ncontact was unintentional. He received the e-mail from Sailor S but did not respond, as \nhe planned to discuss it with her in person. (GE 5 at 11-12; GE 6 at 15) \nIn the NCIS interview, he said, \nI handed the bag to her with my right hand and she grab[bed] with her left \nbecause her right hand is in a [cast]. While reaching and returning my \nhand, she pushed my arm away in a[n] upward manner because I had \ngrazed her breast. I didn\u2019t think much of it at the time, this was not \nintentional or a purposely done act to degrade her. I did not squeeze, \ngrab, pinch, or grope her breast in any way. (GE 6 at 15) \nApplicant\u2019s interactions with Sailor S led to charges under the Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice (UCMJ) Article 92 (Failure to Obey Order or Regulation), by \u201cwrongfully \nmaking inappropriate sexual comments to [Sailor S] about her body parts, creating a \nhostile work environment\u201d; and Article 120 (Abusive Sexual Contact) by touching the \nbreast of Sailor S without her consent. In December 2015, at a nonjudicial punishment \n(NJP) proceeding (captain\u2019s mast) under Article 15 of the UCMJ, he pled not guilty to \nboth specifications but was found guilty by the ship\u2019s commanding officer (CO). \nApplicant was put on restriction for 45 days and forfeited $2,764 in pay for two months. \n(GE 5. Tr. 48-49, 66-69) (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 2.a, 3.b) \nThe CO found that the witnesses\u2019 statements at the NJP proceeding were \nconsistent with their statements to NCIS. Applicant admitted at the captain\u2019s mast that \nhis comments to Sailor S that evening were inappropriate and offensive. He admitted \nthat he had allowed their relationship to become unprofessional and unduly familiar. \n(GE 5 at 12) \nThe CO found that \u201cit is clear that [Applicant] made inappropriate comments of a \nsexual nature about [Sailor S\u2019s] buttocks and breasts, engaged in an unduly familiar \nrelationship with her, and fostered an environment where she was comfortable ignoring \nthe uniform restrictions in his work center.\u201d He found that Applicant was not credible in \nasserting that he may have accidentally touched Sailor S\u2019s breast, \u201cin light of his sexual \nstatements made immediately before the incident and the evidence of fraternization.\u201d \n(GE 5 at 12) He found that a preponderance of the evidence supported the charges. \n(GE 5 at 9) \nThe CO found that Applicant\u2019s behavior \nimpacted good order and discipline, goes against the U.S. Navy\u2019s Core \nValues, and distracts from the Navy\u2019s mission. His behavior clearly \nviolated the Navy\u2019s sexual harassment policy, created a hostile work \nenvironment, and violated all bounds of decency.

He did not believe he was \nbeing treated equally and fairly, as he felt the allegations were based on hearsay and \nwithout concrete evidence. (Tr. 43-45, 114) \nAt captain\u2019s mast, Applicant was asked by the CO about the incident with Sailor \nS and he said it was fabricated, and he did not know why she would not have done this. \nHe suggested during his testimony that it was because she wanted to get out of the \ndeployment, but he does not know that. (Tr. 63-64) \nWith respect to Sailor S\u2019s allegations about the incident in the hospital in 2014, \nApplicant said he escorted her to the hospital once because she was on restriction from \na previous captain\u2019s mast. He remained in the lobby for about two hours. The doctor \ncame out and asked him if he knew of any reason that she would not be able to get \nunderway (with the ship).

He is currently seeing mental health therapists with the Department of Veterans \nAffairs (VA).

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis  \nIn 2015, while a Navy chief petty officer, Applicant violated Navy rules and \nregulations, created a hostile work environment, and exercised extremely poor \njudgment in his inappropriate and offensive words and conduct towards a junior female \nsailor, Sailor S, with whom he had a professional mentor-mentee relationship.

Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts (Guideline F) \nare discussed below.   \nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior \nAG \u00b6 12 expresses the security concern for sexual conduct: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \nApplicant was charged under the UMCJ and was found guilty at captain\u2019s mast \nproceeding of violating Article 120 (Abusive Sexual Contact) by touching the breast of \nSailor S without her consent. AG \u00b6 13(a) applies to that offense. Whether Applicant\u2019s \nother offense, a violation of UCMJ Article 92 (Failure to Obey Order or Regulation), for \n\u201cwrongfully making inappropriate sexual comments to [Sailor S] about her body parts, \ncreating a hostile work environment\u201d is a closer call, since it involved words and not \nconduct. However, I conclude that AG \u00b6 13(a) applies to that offense as well. His words \nand actions towards Sailor S unquestionably constituted a lack of discretion and \njudgment. They also occurred in public, in view of other sailors, all of whom were junior \nsailors and all of whom were males. AG \u00b6 13(d) applies. \nAG \u00b6 14 sets forth the potentially applicable mitigating conditions for sexual \nconduct: \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \nand \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet \nApplicant\u2019s behavior was not private, consensual, or discreet. AG \u00b6 14(d) does \nnot apply. \nAG \u00b6 14(b) does not fully apply. Applicant\u2019s actions occurred in September 2015, \nnow more than eight years ago. He also expressed remorse for his words and wishes \nhe could go back and do things differently. However, he only acknowledged touching \nSailor S\u2019s breast without her consent inadvertently. This is contrary to the findings at the \nNJP proceeding, at which the CO found that the preponderance of the evidence \nestablished that he was guilty of both charges and found that Applicant\u2019s assertions \nabout the events were not credible. Applicant paid a high price for his actions, since it \ncost him his Navy career, He has participated in counseling since then and there is no \nindication of repeated conduct. Nevertheless, Applicant has not fully accepted \nresponsibility for his actions. AG \u00b6 14(b) therefore only partially applies. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct:  \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern for criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nAG \u00b6 31(b) applies to Applicant\u2019s conduct for the same reason that AG \u00b6 13(a) \napplies under Guideline D, above. \nAG \u00b6 32 sets forth the potentially applicable mitigating conditions regarding \ncriminal conduct: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6 32(a) does not fully apply under the same rationale as discussed under \nGuideline D AG \u00b6 14(b). \nAG \u00b6 32(d) only partially applies. Applicant denied doing anything more than \ngrazing Sailor S\u2019s breast and doing so inadvertently. The CO conducting the captain\u2019s \nmast found that Applicant\u2019s testimony was not credible, and Applicant was found guilty \nof touching her breast without her consent. His actions and words occurred several \nyears ago. He paid a high price, as he was separated from the Navy with only months \nbefore he could retire, at 20 years. He has participated in counseling with the VA in the \nyears since. He expressed remorse and regret for his actions. He also expressed \nbitterness at what happened, and he sought to blame the victim during his testimony. \nHis evaluations from his civilian job show he is highly regarded at work, as an \noutstanding leader. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleged not Applicant\u2019s conduct itself (alleged under \nGuideline D), but the resulting negative consequences: both the discharge (SOR \u00b6 3.a) \nand the NJP proceeding that came before it. (SOR \u00b6 3.b) First, the NJP action is already \nalleged under Guideline J, above. A cross-allegation under Guideline E is duplicative \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nand unnecessary. Further, the second consequence (the discharge) merely followed \nfrom the first (the NJP proceeding). As such, it is not properly alleged as an \nindependent allegation. Lastly, negative consequences are not conduct. Thus, SOR \u00b6 \n3.a is found for Applicant. No disqualifying conditions apply under Guideline E. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout, in relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant incurred various delinquent debts in the years after he separated from \nthe Navy in 2016. The debts are established by the credit reports in the record and by \nApplicant\u2019s admissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s various debts arose because he became financially overextended \nafter leaving the Navy. He was understandably depressed as he dealt with the sudden \nend of his Navy career, only months before retirement. It took time to find good \nemployment and his income level decreased. However, he was also separated from the \nNavy due to his own misconduct. This does not constitute a circumstance beyond his \ncontrol. He also did not act responsibly or in good faith, since he addressed his SOR \ndebts only on the eve of hearing. While he has pursued credit counseling and used a \nloan to address his debts, he has not established a track record of steady payments \ntowards his debts so as to demonstrate good-faith efforts to resolve them. An applicant \nwho waits to address his debts until compelled by the security clearance process to do \nso does not demonstrate good faith. Applicant\u2019s belated actions to address his debts \nare not sufficient evidence to mitigate the Guideline F security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunder Guidelines J, D, E, and F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant exercised \nextremely poor judgment in his interactions with Sailor S, a young, junior sailor with \nwhom he had a mentor-mentee relationship. He abused his position as a chief petty \nofficer and as her mentor, and he acted inappropriately and offensively towards her in \nthe presence of other junior, male sailors. His actions were very serious, and he paid a \nhigh price, since he was found guilty at captain\u2019s mast, and most seriously, he received \na general discharge under honorable conditions from the ADSEP board only months \nbefore he became retirement eligible. Applicant acknowledged his offensive words, but \ndenied the abusive sexual conduct towards Sailor S, despite the CO\u2019s findings. While \nHis actions are now quite dated, there is no evidence of recurrence, he has been to \ncounseling, and he has an excellent work record. Nevertheless, it is difficult to credit him \nwith sufficient evidence mitigation without full acceptance of his actions. Applicant did \nnot provide sufficient evidence to mitigate security concerns under Guideline D (sexual \nconduct) and Guideline J (criminal conduct). Guideline E (personal conduct) allegations \nare either duplicative or are not properly alleged as disqualifying conduct, so they are \nnot established. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues also remain a security concern. He took little to no \naction to address his SOR debts until only days before his hearing, when he took out a \nloan to pay them off. While he largely did so, he is now responsible for paying off that \nloan. This essentially trades one financial responsibility for another, and on this record, \nthat is not a substitute for a track record of steady payments towards his debts, nor is it \nsufficient evidence of good faith, responsible action to address his debts. I conclude that \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the Guideline F security \nconcerns. \nApplicant has not met his burden to establish that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline D: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 4: Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 4.a-4.g:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant access to classified information. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBraden M.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, 28, has worked on the same federal contract as a research analyst since August 2016. Her current employer was awarded the contract in March 2020. She was initially granted national security eligibility in January 2016 by another government agency. She completed her most recent security clearance application in January 2021, disclosing $23,000 in delinquent student loans. She explained that the delinquency was caused by a mistake she made regarding the repayment terms of her student loans. The SOR alleges that Applicant owes approximately $24,000 on seven delinquent student loan accounts, which she admits. (GE 2-3) Applicant attended college between August 2012 and May 2016, but did not earn a degree. She financed her education with student loans. When she entered repayment, she mistakenly believed that her nine loans were consolidated into two categories: subsidized and unsubsidized. Accordingly, each month, she made a payment to each category of loans. Less than a year later, she received a letter from the U.S. Department of Education. She misread the letter and thought that the agency had forgiven some portion of her loans. In early 2020, she received a notice from a collection agency, informing her that seven of her loans were in default. The March 2021 credit report, GE 6, shows that two of the loans have a history of timely payment and seven loans were in collection status. (GE 5-6) In June 2021, Applicant received a letter from a student loan",

The Government submitted its written case on May 26, \n2022. The Government provided Applicant with a complete copy of the file of relevant \nmaterial (FORM) and the Directive. She acknowledged receipt of the documents on \nJune 13, 2022, and did not respond. The attachments to the FORM are admitted to the \nrecord as GEs 1 through 7. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, 28, has worked on the same federal contract as a research analyst \nsince August 2016. Her current employer was awarded the contract in March 2020. She \nwas initially granted national security eligibility in January 2016 by another government \nagency. She completed her most recent security clearance application in January 2021, \ndisclosing $23,000 in delinquent student loans. She explained that the delinquency was \ncaused by a mistake she made regarding the repayment terms of her student loans. \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant owes approximately $24,000 on seven delinquent \nstudent loan accounts, which she admits. (GE 2-3) \nApplicant attended college between August 2012 and May 2016, but did not earn \na degree. She financed her education with student loans. When she entered repayment, \nshe mistakenly believed that her nine loans were consolidated into two categories: \nsubsidized and unsubsidized. Accordingly, each month, she made a payment to each \ncategory of loans. Less than a year later, she received a letter from the U.S. \nDepartment of Education. She misread the letter and thought that the agency had \nforgiven some portion of her loans. In early 2020, she received a notice from a \ncollection agency, informing her that seven of her loans were in default. The March \n2021 credit report, GE 6, shows that two of the loans have a history of timely payment \nand seven loans were in collection status. (GE 5-6) \nIn June 2021, Applicant received a letter from a student loan collection agency \nregarding the process for rehabilitating her student loans. She completed the first step \nof that process by signing a rehabilitation agreement in June 2021, agreeing to make \nnine, on-time payments of $207. The letter also informed her that under the CARES Act, \nshe was not required to make any payments during the student loan payment pause \nthat began in March 2020, and the rehabilitation plan would begin after the pause was \nscheduled to expire in September 2021. However, President Biden extended the pause \nbeyond September 2021, and the pause is expected to expire on December 31, 2022. \n(GE 4-5; See, Press Release, Biden-Harris Administration Announces Final Student \nLoan Pause Extension Through December 31 and Targeted Debt Cancellation to \nSmooth Transition to Repayment (August 24, 2022), https://www.ed.gov/news/press-\nreleases/biden-harris-administration-announces-final-student-loan-pause-extension-\nthrough-december-31-and-targeted-debt-cancellation-smooth-transition-repayment) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAside from the alleged student loan accounts, Applicant does not have any other \ndelinquent accounts. She has one credit card, which does not have a balance. Her only \nother consumer debt is a vehicle loan, which is in good standing. According to the \nfinancial statement she provided during her June 2021 background interview, Applicant \nlives within her means and has $107 in disposable income after accounting for all of her \nmonthly expenses, which included the anticipated student loan rehabilitation payment. \n(GE 5) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nadministrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 \ndescribing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative \ngoal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision.\n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAn individual\u2019s finances become a concern when their failure to meet their \nfinancial obligations is a possible indication of poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at a greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 18) \nThe record establishes the Government\u2019s prima facie case. Applicant has seven \ndelinquent student loans that have been in collection since at least 2017. The following \nfinancial considerations disqualifying condition applies: \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nSeven of Applicant\u2019s student loans became delinquent after she failed to pay \nproper attention to the underlying details of the loans, a failure for which she has taken \nresponsibility. The record supports her explaination that she mistakenly thought she \nonly had two loans to pay. After learning of her mistake, she took steps to return seven \ndelinquent loans to good standing. Applicant\u2019s efforts are not diminished because she is \na beneficiary of the student loan payment pause and is not required to make any \nrehabilitation payments until January 2023. She has demonstrated that she can afford \nthe projected rehabilitaton payment. The following mitigating condition applies: \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nBased on the record, I have no doubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to \nclassified information. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-\nperson factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). The purpose of a security clearance adjudication is not \ndebt collection. Rather the purpose is to make \u201can examination of a sufficient period and \na careful weighing of a number of variables of an individual\u2019s life to make an affirmative \ndetermination that the person is an acceptable security risk.\u201d (AG \u00b6 2(a)) The record \ndoes not contain any evidence to suggest that Applicant has an unwillingness or \ninability to follow the rules related to classified information. She has held a security \nclearance without incident since 2016. Her statements regarding her intent to comply \nwith the student loan rehabilitation program are credible, given that she began \naccounting for the monthly payment as a part of her monthly budget since June 2021. \nThe circumstances that caused her financial problems do not raise questions about her \nreliability, trustworthiness, or ability to properly handle or safeguard classified \ninformation. Applicant reported her error on her security clearance application, showing \nthat she is likely to take responsibility for her mistakes and self-report derogatory \ninformation. A fair and commonsense assessment of the record evidence as a whole \nsupports a conclusion that the security concerns raised under the financial \nconsiderations guideline are mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.g: \nFor Applicant \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nBased on the record, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for a security clearance.

He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1982 and a master\u2019s \ndegree in 2017. He has a 40-year-old child from a relationship. He married in 1984 and \ndivorced in 2000.

His wife is employed as a school teacher. (Transcript (Tr.) 20-24, 51; GE 1) \nIn March 2019, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) as part \nof his reinvestigation. He disclosed that in February 2018 he was terminated from his job \nwith a federal contractor because he misused his corporate credit card for personal use. \nDuring his hearing, he testified that in 2013, while working for the same employer, he had \nmisused his corporate credit card for personal use. He acknowledged that he was aware \nof the prohibition of using his corporate credit card for personal use. He had signed a \ndocument about the proper use of corporate credit cards and was aware that using it for \npersonal reasons was in violation of the agreement. He received a written warning for the \n2013 misuse. In 2018, he used the corporate credit card again for personal use. He was \nterminated from employment for the second violation. He testified he was aware he was \nnot permitted to use the corporate credit card for personal use. Applicant explained that \non both occasions, he repaid the amount owed in a short period of time.

He chose to receive monthly payments, \nand he also withdrew $50,000 from his 401k pension plan. He testified that an amount \nfrom the pension plan was used to pay the taxes owed for the early withdrawal. He \ntestified that he used the lump-sum to pay down his federal tax debt.

Installment agreement in place for $200 per month until debt satisfied. \nEstimate: $8,000. (GE 1) \nApplicant testified that his OIC to the IRS was to settle the tax debt for $25,000. It \nwas rejected in June 2019. The SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s income tax debt to the IRS at \nthe time of the SOR was $66,479 and to State B was $20,767. Applicant testified that he \ncurrently owes the IRS $73,491 and he owes $22,502 to State B for delinquent income \ntaxes. Post-hearing, Applicant provided documents from the IRS showing the total \namount he owes for delinquent federal income taxes is $71,651 and state income taxes \nis $22,352. (Tr. 24, 65-66; AE A, H) \nApplicant testified that over the years he has had installment agreements with the \nIRS and this is corroborated by his income tax transcripts. From at least 2012, as \nconfirmed by tax year transcripts for tax years 2011 through 2017, an installment \nagreement would be repeatedly established, reflect it was pending, and then stopped and \nremoved. During these years penalties and interest continued to accrue. Applicant \ntestified that he was unaware that his installment agreement would be removed each new \ntax year when he failed to pay his income taxes on time. (Tr. 29-30; GE 2) \nApplicant disclosed in his SCA that in 2018 a federal tax lien was entered against \nhis residence for $57,000 and State B entered a tax lien for $5,744. He hired an attorney \nto address the liens. He stated in his SCA the following: \u201cThe federal tax lien was lifted \ndue to soliciting the help from an attorney which we paid for their services, plus we are in \nnegotiations with the IRS to settle our debt with an OIC.\u201d He stated the reasons for his \ntax issues were because his move from State A to State B was more costly than \nanticipated. His wife was unemployed from 2014 to 2017 and once she resumed working \nin the summer of 2017 their finances improved. He also stated that withdrawing money \nfrom his pension plan resulted in penalties and additional federal taxes owed which \ncaused financial hardships. (Tr. 45-47; GE 1) \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in May 2019. He told the \ninvestigator that he always filed his income tax returns on time as required, but he owed \nfederal income taxes for tax years 2009 and 2011 through 2017 and to State B for tax \nyears 2015, 2016 and 2017.

In addition, his wife was unemployed from 2014 to the summer \nof 2017. He also admitted that he and his family were spending more money than they \nshould have, which caused his debts to grow. He withdrew some money from his pension \nplan to pay for his stepdaughter\u2019s college tuition, which had tax consequences. He said \nhe would not have been able to pay his living expenses if he had paid his yearly tax bills. \nHe said he deliberately made the decision to not pay his tax bills each year because he \nwould not have been able to cover his living expenses. Instead, he contacted the IRS and \nState B to negotiate payment arrangements. He said, that at the time of the interview, \nnone of his tax debts had been satisfied. He said he was able to make an arrangement \nwith State B in January 2019 to pay $200 a month and was in compliance. He anticipated \nthat his tax debts would be resolved within the next five years. He said he had readjusted \nhis withholdings and put his family on a budget. (Tr. 66-67; GE 2, 3) \nApplicant\u2019s tax transcripts from December 2020 reflect his adjusted gross income \nin 2011 was $193,491; 2012 - $171,032; 2013 - $170,859; 2014 - $150,960; 2015 - \n$191,631; 2016 - $152,642; 2017 - $173,586; 2018 - $273,634; 2019 - $204,099; 2020 - \n$227,991; and 2021 \u2013 $211,427. (Tr. 68-69; GE 2; AE C, D, E) \nThe tax transcripts from 2011 through 2014 show a zero balance owed each year. \nIt appears a refund from tax year 2019 may have been applied to these tax years\u2019 \nbalances. Tax transcripts from December 2020 show balances owed for 2015 - $31,036; \n2016 - $10,578; 2017 - $17,222; and 2018 - $7,903. Post-hearing, Applicant provided his \n2019 tax year transcript, which reflected a zero balance owed and a refund was applied \nto his delinquent 2015 tax debt. He also provided his 2020 and 2021 tax transcripts which \nreflect he owes $8,673 for tax year 2020 and $3,726 for tax year 2021. Applicant stated \nin his post-hearing letter that he was unable to obtain tax transcripts for years earlier than \n2013 because the IRS only had the past ten tax years available. (GE 2, AE A, C, D, E) \nApplicant testified that he had an installment agreement with the IRS sometime in \n2020 to pay $760. Based on documents he provided post-hearing, it appears this \nagreement started in March 2021 and continued to July 2021. He made the monthly \npayments. His 2020 tax transcript reflects that in March 2022 he established an \ninstallment agreement. His 2021 tax transcript reflects another installment agreement \nestablished in July 2022. He testified that in October 2022, he had a new installment \nagreement with the IRS to pay $1,162 a month for five years. (Tr. 24-30, 34; AE A, C, D, \nE, F, G) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to timely file State A income tax returns for \ntax years 2010, 2011 and 2012. Applicant denied this and claimed he has always filed his \ntax returns timely. He provided a document from State A that shows his 2010 income tax \nreturn was filed and he made monthly payments toward the tax due. He was unable to \nproduce the 2011 and 2012 returns. He provided a letter from the State showing he did \nnot have any balance owed for taxes. I found Applicant\u2019s testimony credible.

Applicant provided documents from his State B\u2019s department of \nrevenue. The documents show the current balance owed is $22,352 for delinquent taxes, \nand his 2021 refund was applied to the balance owed. He provided a history of past \npayments he made on his delinquent state tax debt. It appears that in 2017 he had a \npayment plan with State B. He did not provide a copy of it. From June 2017 to July 2021, \nhe made a total of 36 payments, of which 29 were applied to his delinquent 2015 taxes \nand the remaining 7 payments were made in 2018, 2019, and 2020 and applied to his \n2016 tax debt. Applicant also provided a document from February 1, 2023, showing he \nentered into an installment agreement with State B to pay $419 a month for 60 months to \nresolve his debt. (Tr. 41; AE H, I, J) \nApplicant has not had financial counseling. He said he had a financial planner in \n2007 and 2008, and he should have continued their services. Prior to 2014, he prepared \nhis own tax returns. After 2014, he had a professional prepare his tax returns. When he \nlearned he would owe taxes each year, he would contact the IRS and State B to make \npayment arrangements. He said he was unaware of how installment agreements worked. \nHe was unaware that if he failed to pay a subsequent year\u2019s taxes owed the installment \nagreement would likely stop. He testified that he did not pay his annual income taxes \nbecause he was unable to do so since he did not have the money. (Tr. 33, 59-62) \nApplicant\u2019s current salary is $185,000. He qualifies for bonuses and last year \nreceived one between $10,000 and $12,000.

It may be considered when making a credibility determination, \nin the application of mitigating conditions, and in a whole-person analysis. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations;  \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee \ntheft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing deceptive \nloan statements and other intentional financial breaches of trust; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \nApplicant is indebted to the federal government for delinquent taxes in the amount \nof approximately $71,651. He is indebted to State B in the amount of approximately \n$22,351. Although, initially he may have been unable to pay his taxes on time because \nhe failed to withhold sufficient funds, he was aware of the issue and each year continued \nhis practice of not paying his federal and state income taxes on time. Applicant knowingly \nmisused his corporate credit card in 2013 and again in 2018. There is sufficient evidence \nto support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThere is insufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant failed to file State A \nincome tax returns for tax years 2010, 2011, and 2012. I find for him for SOR \u00b6 1.c. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant continues to have a large federal and state income tax debt. His financial \nissues are recent and ongoing. Based on his long history of failing to timely pay his taxes, \nI am unable to find that future problems are unlikely to recur. Applicant knowingly misused \nhis corporate credit card in 2013 and was given a written warning. Despite being aware \nof the rules and potential consequences, he repeated his offense in 2018 and was \nterminated from his job. Applicant\u2019s conduct cast doubts on his reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant attributed his tax problems to relocating to a different state. Applicant \nmay have had added expenses with his move, but this did not create his tax problems. \nHe was not paying his federal income taxes before his move and again after his move. \nAlso, his wife\u2019s unemployment was beyond his control, but it also did not create tax \nproblems as federal tax is based on income. There is insufficient evidence to find that \nApplicant\u2019s tax issues were beyond his control or that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. His repeated failure to withhold sufficient funds to cover his taxes or timely \npay his taxes recurred over many years. Each year he failed to timely pay his taxes, he \nincurred additional penalties and interest. Despite being in contact with the IRS and \nhaving an installment agreement, he would then fail to pay his current year\u2019s taxes, which \nwould exacerbate the issue. Applicant failed to act responsibly. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not \napply. \nApplicant has not received financial counseling and there is not clear evidence that \nhis financial problems are under control. There is evidence that Applicant has had \ninstallment agreements with the IRS in the past and had a payment plan with the state \ntax authority. However, he does not have a reliable financial track record of adhering to \nthese agreements and satisfying his yearly tax obligation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not \napply. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant made an arrangement with the IRS to pay his delinquent taxes and made \na recent arrangement with his state tax authority. As noted above, he does not yet have \na reliable track record of adhering to his installment agreements. AG \u00b6 20(g) applies to \nthe extent that he has an installment agreement with the IRS and his state, but it is too \nearly to tell if he will make consistent payments. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nDespite being aware that he had an obligation to plan for his tax liability, Applicant \nrepeatedly failed to do so, increasing the amount he owed with penalties and interest. He \nalso failed to pay his state income taxes. The DOHA Appeal Board has held that: \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. August 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C.

June \n29, 2016.). \nApplicant\u2019s history of non-compliance with a fundamental legal obligation to timely \npay his federal and state income taxes raises serious concerns.

He is a high school graduate. He served in the Inactive Reserve \nof his state\u2019s Army National Guard from June 1990 until June 1994, when he was \nhonorably discharged. Since March 1990, he has worked for a defense contractor. (Item \n3.) \nGuideline F  \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant has 16 delinquent debts totaling \nabout $36,000, a total that includes a $12,550 debt for state taxes (2016, 2017, and 2018). \n(Item 1.) Applicant\u2019s credit reports (8/2020, 3/2021, 6/2022) support the Guideline F \nallegations. (Items 5 through 7.) He admitted SOR \u00b61.a, a voluntary car repossession \n($11,612), and SOR \u00b6 1.p, the state tax allegation. For the latter, he said he is paying \n$500 per month to pay it off; the balance is $5,300. He provided documents showing his \npaycheck deduction for the tax debt but none showing the balance due. His payments \nare under an involuntary tax levy. He denied SOR \u00b6 1.b ($468), because \u201cI have not seen \na collection letter.\u201d He denied medical accounts SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.n ($5,800 \ncombined), because he has \u201cnot seen collection letters.\u201d He denied SOR \u00b6 1.o, a \nconsumer debt ($8,615), because he does \u201cnot recall this collection.\u201d (Items 2 and 8.) \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began in 2011 when his wife lost her longstanding \ngovernment job. The medical accounts are for his wife\u2019s medical condition. Her lost \nincome was aggravated by a \u201chealth issue that caused her not to have a stable income.\u201d \n(Items 4 and 8.) The record supports the Guideline F allegations. (Items 4-8.) During his \nSeptember 24, 2020 Personal Subject Interview (PSI), Applicant said his delinquent \naccounts would be paid, settled, or satisfied within 60 days of the PSI, or he would file for \nbankruptcy. (Item 8.) Neither has occurred. (Items 6 and 7.) His collection accounts show \nlast activity dates in the summer of 2020 and became delinquent at that time.

It showed a total net monthly \nincome of $8,820. After expenses and debt service, his monthly net remainder was \n$1,985. (Item 4.) \nGuideline E \nUnder Guideline E, SOR \u00b6 2.a alleged that although Applicant answered \u201cyes\u201d that \nhe had accounts that were in collection or charged off, he failed to disclose the specific \ninformation alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.n. (Item 1.) He admitted that allegation, \nstating that over the \u201clast few years my wife and I have been trying to reconcile these \nissues . . . looking for a good solution on a re-fresh program or possibly bankruptcy . . . .\u201d \n(Item 2.) In his SCA, he disclosed the state tax delinquency, its estimated amount, and \nwhen it will be paid off. (Item 3.) In his PSI, he testified in some detail about the delinquent \ndebts that were ultimately alleged in the SOR. (Item 8.) \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n  Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, then the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n        \n \n \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to . . . pay state . . . income tax as required.  \nApplicant\u2019s SOR debts are established by the Government\u2019s credit reports and \nApplicant\u2019s admissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (f) apply. \nAG \u00b6 20 includes the following conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMost of Applicant\u2019s SOR accounts became delinquent in 2020. That is not that long \nago. And they remained in default when the SOR was issued. Also, those debts were not \ninfrequent. Thus, AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply to mitigate those debts. \nMitigating factor AG \u00b6 20(b) has two principal elements. First, there must be \n\u201cconditions\u201d \u201clargely beyond the [applicant\u2019s] control\u201d that caused the financial problem. \nSecond, the applicant must have \u201cacted responsibly\u201d under the adverse circumstances \nhe confronted. \nThe loss of Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s job was complicated by her subsequent medical \ncondition. Those events caused financial hardship. They were \u201clargely beyond\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s control, thus satisfying the first element of AG \u00b6 20(b). \nThe next inquiry is whether Applicant acted responsibly under those adverse \ncircumstances. In this case, it does not appear that Applicant made any efforts to contact \nunpaid creditors or otherwise resolve his debts. His promises to pay in the future are not \nrecognized by the Appeals Board as mitigating factors. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-\n04565 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2015) The second element of AG \u00b6 20(b) is not satisfied. \nApplicant\u2019s SOR debts are not mitigated under AG \u00b6 20(b).  \nApplicant is paying his state tax debt under an involuntary tax levy. The satisfaction \nof a debt through involuntary payments, such as a tax levy, is not the same as a good-\nfaith initiation of repayment by the debtor. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-03122 at 3 (App. \nBd. Aug. 17, 2018). Therefore, mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. Nor does \nAG \u00b6 20(d) apply to the other debts in the SOR \nNone of Applicant\u2019s SOR debts have been resolved or mitigated. I find against \nApplicant on SOR \u00b6 1.  \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct  \nIn assessing an allegation of deliberate falsification, I consider not only the \nallegation and applicant\u2019s answer but all relevant circumstances. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-\n(9) (explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). Under Guideline E for personal \nconduct, the concern is that \u201c[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d A statement or omission is false or dishonest when it is made deliberately \n(knowingly and willfully).  \nIn this case, the SOR alleged that Applicant deliberately falsified facts by failing to \ndisclose the details of the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.n. This conduct falls \nwithin AG \u00b6 16(a), which states in pertinent part: \n[D]eliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire . . . used to conduct investigations.  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Formal Findings \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nI \nThe narrower question is whether Applicant\u2019s omission in his SCA was deliberate. \nHe admitted this allegation in his Answer. But in his SCA, he answered \u201cyes\u201d to whether \nhe had any routine accounts that were delinquent. He also identified his state tax liability, \nits amount, and the expected date of its pay-off. The record shows that his failure to \nprovide details of each delinquent account did not impede or impair the investigation. His \n\u201cyes\u201d answer sufficiently alerted the investigators to look further into his financial \nbackground, which they did. The results of that further inquiry were then embodied in the \nSOR. I find that Applicant did not deliberately omit those specific details from his SCA. \nfind in favor of Applicant on SOR \u00b6 2. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F and Guideline \nE in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant leaves me with questions about his eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For those reasons, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. Security concerns arising \nunder Guideline E, personal conduct, are not established. \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.-p.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a.: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nPhilip J. Katauskas \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn January 13, 2022, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued to Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nIn Applicant\u2019s undated answer to the SOR, he requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. The case was assigned to me on July 3, 2023. The Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on July 25, 2023, scheduling \nthe hearing for August 21, 2023.

DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on August 31, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 49 years old. He served in the military and retired honorably in the \npaygrade E-7. He served combat tours in 2003-2004 and 2004-2005 (12 months and 13 \nmonths). He earned an associate degree in 2019. He married for the fourth time in 2006. \nHe has four children. He has a child from a previous relationship; adopted two stepsons, \nand he and his wife have a child together. His youngest son is in high school. The others \nare adults. Applicant started his own business in March 2021, which contracts with the \nfederal government. Before then he was employed by federal contractors since his \nmilitary retirement. (Tr. 18-24; GE 1) \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) on February 8, 2021. \nSection 26 asked if he had failed to file or pay any federal, state, or local tax returns. He \nresponded \u201cno.\u201d It also asked if he had any debts that were in collection or past 120 days \ndelinquent. He answered \u201cno.\u201d He did not disclose any financial difficulties. He testified \nthe omission was an oversight. (Tr. 48-51; GE 1) \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator on February 24, 2021. He \ntold the investigator that he had received a letter from the IRS two weeks prior that said \nhe underpaid his taxes and owed $5,500. He said he did not disclose this information on \nhis SCA because he was unaware of the issue when he completed it. He said his mother-\nin-law did the paperwork for their tax returns, and he had hired the same accountant that \nworks on his self-employment to look into this issue. (GE 2) \nApplicant responded to government interrogatories, and he adopted the summary \nof his interview by a government investigator affirming it was accurate. In the \ninterrogatories, he disclosed he had not timely filed his 2018 and 2019 federal income tax \nreturns. He requested an extension to file his 2020 federal income tax return and it was \nfiled timely. He testified that he filed the delinquent 2018 and 2019 federal returns in April \n2021 and May 2021, respectively. He testified he had no excuse for his failure to timely \nfile the tax returns. He was aware that he owed federal taxes for 2018, 2019, and 2020 \nand he did not pay them when they were due or when he filed those tax returns.

He said he had difficulties filing his 2019 federal tax return \nelectronically because there was an incorrect social security number. In January 2022, \nhe received a notification by letter from the IRS advising him to pay the balance he owed \nof $6,965 and to file his missing returns. It said the years required to be filed were \nindicated on the next page. That page was not provided by Applicant, and it is unknown \nwhat tax years the IRS was referring to. Applicant did not provide federal tax transcripts \nas requested in the government interrogatories and discussed during his hearing. In \nJanuary 2022, he paid the IRS the amount he owed. It is unknown if he filed the missing \nreturns mentioned by the IRS and what years were missing. (Tr. 36-38, 59-66, 77; GE 2; \nAE A, B) \nApplicant testified that he received a letter from his state\u2019s taxation department \nbased on the audit of his 2018 federal tax return and he owed $1,000. He did not provide \na copy of the letter. He testified that he paid his state taxes, and he does not owe any \ntaxes to his state. He did not provide documentary proof. (Tr. 67-69; GE 2; AE A, B) \nThe SOR alleged three delinquent credit card debts (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a - $16,740; 1.b \u00ad\n$14,430; and 1.c - $3,517). Applicant attributed the delinquent credit cards to a period \nafter he retired from the military in 2015 when he was underemployed, and his wife was \nunable to work due to surgery in 2015 and 2016. He also testified that he used these \ncredit cards to maintain a lifestyle he was accustomed to both before and after he retired. \nIn his SOR answer, he said these debts were attributable to his wife having multiple \nsurgeries from 2018 to 2020, and her inability to work full time. He said they were \nstruggling financially. He does not know when the cards became delinquent, but he \nreceived collection notices about the debts. He also attributed his financial problems to \nspending money on legal fees for his son who got into trouble. His August 2023 credit \nreport reflects the last payment on the credit cards in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b were in April \n2018 and January 2018, respectively. He testified that he decided at the time to pay other \nbills and not pay the credit cards. His wife did not work from 2006 to 2019. She attended \nschool for about nine years, earning a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2015 and a master\u2019s degree \nin 2019. (Tr. 29-33, 39-44, 47, GE 2, 3, 4) \nApplicant stated in his SOR answer regarding the two debts alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.b (owed to the same creditor) that he was working on a payment plan to resolve them. \nHe testified that in about 2019 or 2020 the creditor agreed to settle the debt for a lump \nsum payment, but he was unable to pay the amount. He took no further action until he\ncontacted the creditor about two weeks before his hearing, and it would not negotiate a\npayment plan. He explained he had saved some money but then needed to help his son \nwith his legal issues. At his hearing, he explained he will resolve the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\nand 1.b after he completes the refinancing of his house. He said it took him seven months \nto find a mortgage company that would refinance his house due to his credit history. He \nanticipated the refinancing to be completed sometime in September 2023. Post-hearing,\nhe stated that he was refinancing his house and then would pay the debts.

He testified that he thought he had paid this credit card but \nlearned that he had two accounts with the creditor, and he paid the other one. When he \nwas interviewed by a government investigator in February 2021, he explained that this \ncredit card was used to pay for a cruise he and his family took in 2016 as a Christmas \npresent. He and his wife also took a separate cruise in 2016 to celebrate their 10th  \nanniversary. His family took a cruise in 2019 that was paid for by other relatives. He and \nhis wife took a vacation in 2020 to celebrate her birthday. In his post-hearing response, \nhe said the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e is no longer on his credit report. He testified when he \nchecked his credit report this debt was not listed. He said he contacted the creditor and \nwas told \u201cno debt.\u201d The debt is reported on his February 2021 and August 2023 credit \nreport. (Tr. 33-36 72-75; GE 2, 3, 4; AE C) \nApplicant testified that his annual income is approximately $80,000. He has \nreceived approximately $1,700 a month from VA disability ($20,400 annually) since 2015. \nHe also receives military retirement pay of $21,600 annually. His wife\u2019s current annual \nincome is $55,000, which she has earned for the past year. Her monthly VA disability is \n$1,000 (approximately $12,000 annual since 2007). In 2019, she earned about $26,000. \nHe estimated he has about $5,000 to $6,000 in his bank accounts and a small amount in \na pension account. (Tr. 26-29, 53-54, 76) \nApplicant has not had financial counseling. He said he is current on all of his \nfinancial obligations. He does not have a budget. (Tr. 71-72) \nAny derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will not be considered \nfor disqualifying purposes. It may be considered when applying the mitigating conditions, \nin making a credibility determination, and in a whole-person analysis. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income taxes as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to timely pay his federal income taxes for tax years 2018, 2019, \nand 2020. He also owed state income taxes that he failed to timely pay. He has three \ndelinquent credit card debts. He admitted living beyond his means and used one of the \ncredit cards to finance a cruise for his family in 2016. There is sufficient evidence to \nsupport the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant failed to pay his federal income taxes until after he received the SOR. \nHe received a notification from the IRS in January 2022, that directed him to pay his \ndelinquent federal taxes and to file his missing tax returns. He paid the amount due on \nJanuary 22, 2022. He did not provide proof that his delinquent state taxes were paid, but \nI believe his testimony that he resolved those too, albeit late. Although not alleged in the \nSOR, Applicant did not file his 2018 and 2019 federal income tax returns until after he \nwas interviewed by a government investigator. He did not pay his taxes for those tax \nyears until after he was notified by the IRS and after his security clearance investigation \nbegan. He was aware of the security concern when he completed his February 2021 \ninterrogatories. Based on Applicant\u2019s failure to provide tax transcripts and the second \npage of the letter from the IRS telling him what tax years were not yet filed, I have serious \nquestions about their status. AG \u00b6 20(g) applies to Applicant\u2019s delinquent tax payments. \nApplicant has three delinquent credit card debts totaling about $34,687 that remain \nunpaid. He attributed his financial problems to a period in 2015 and 2016 when his wife \nhad surgery, he was transitioning from the military, and later, his son\u2019s legal issues. He \nsaid in his SOR answer that his financial problems were due to his wife\u2019s surgeries in \n2018 to 2020. These were conditions beyond his control. For the full application of AG \u00b6 \n20(b), he must have acted responsibly under the circumstances. He has not resolved the \ndebts that have been delinquent for at least five years. He used a credit card to finance \nhis family\u2019s vacation in 2016 and did not pay it. He hopes to resolve them when he \nrefinances his house. AG \u00b6 20(b) has some application. \nApplicant has not had financial counseling, and there are not clear indications his \nfinancial problems are under control. He said he attempted to resolve the credit card debts \nseveral years ago but did not because he did not have the lump sum to pay them. Based \non Applicant\u2019s spending and lifestyle I did not find him credible that he has made \nreasonable efforts to resolve his debts. They remain unresolved. He is planning on paying \nhis delinquent credit card debts after he refinances his house. Intentions to pay debts in \nthe future are not a substitute for a track record of debt repayment or other responsible \napproaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). Applicant\u2019s \ndebts remain unpaid, and he has not exercised good judgment in addressing them. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(c), and 20(d) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that Guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s military service and participation in combat operations. \nHe was aware his finances were a security concern, but he failed to make them a priority. \nDespite some minimal mitigation, he does not have a reliable financial track record that \nwould enable me to trust that he will pay his debts or manage his financial affairs \nresponsibly in the future. He did not address his tax issues until they came up during his \nsecurity clearance process.  \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has held that: \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. August 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C.

For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. \n1  ISCR Case No. 12-10933 at 3 (App. Bd.

In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations \nApplicant had significant past-due indebtedness. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts \nApplicant has addressed all of the alleged past-due indebtedness. It was caused, \nin part, by failed marriages and their related costs; and, in part, by a start-up business \nfailure. He was only made aware of the business failure well after the fact of said failure. \nHe has now demonstrated that future financial problems are unlikely. Mitigation under \nAG \u00b6 20 has been established. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant has a \ndistinguished history of working in the defense industry and is respected by those who \nknow him. He performs well at his job. (AppXs N, V and W.) Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated \nthe Financial Considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1. a~1.d:  \nFor Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 34-year-old new employee of a defense contractor. His start date was scheduled to be in January 2023. He worked for a different defense contractor in 2022. He served on active duty in the U.S. military from 2012 until he was discharged with an under other than honorable conditions discharge in 2021. He seeks to retain a security clearance, which he has held since his time in the military. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree earned in 2010, and he has taken graduate courses in pursuit of a master\u2019s degree. He is married with two children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 7-8, 22-28; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 4, 5; AE G) Applicant deployed to Afghanistan for about nine months in 2016 through 2017. He was stationed in a foreign country from 2017 until his discharge. From that duty station, he deployed to another foreign country in 2018. The multiple deployments and overseas tour led to marital stress. In January to February 2019, he was on temporary duty at a military installation in State A in the United States. While there, he met an individual online who identified \u201cherself\u201d on multiple occasions as a 13-year-old girl. It was actually a police officer from State A running a sting operation to catch potential child predators. (I will refer to the individual with feminine pronouns even though it was actually a male.)

(Transcript (Tr.) at 7-8, 22-28; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 1, 4, 5; AE G) \nApplicant deployed to Afghanistan for about nine months in 2016 through 2017. \nHe was stationed in a foreign country from 2017 until his discharge. From that duty \nstation, he deployed to another foreign country in 2018. The multiple deployments and \noverseas tour led to marital stress. In January to February 2019, he was on temporary \nduty at a military installation in State A in the United States.

It \nwas actually a police officer from State A running a sting operation to catch potential \nchild predators. (I will refer to the individual with feminine pronouns even though it was \nactually a male.) Applicant and the individual engaged in a series of graphic sexual \nmessages. (Tr. at 27-33, 38-40, 55-57, 60-62, 68-70; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE \n1, 5; AE A, H) \nApplicant returned to his foreign duty station. He continued to have graphic \nsexual communications with the individual who identified herself as a 13-year-old girl. \nHe sent a video of himself masturbating and two photographs of his penis. He \nrequested that she send him sexually explicit images of herself, which, if she was truly \nan underage girl, would have been child pornography under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2252 and \n2256. He stated that he wanted to perform sexual acts on her, and he planned to travel \nto State A to do so. (Tr. at 39-42; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5; AE H) \nA military criminal investigation was initiated in April 2019 based upon a report \nfrom State A law enforcement. Applicant waived his right to remain silent and was \ninterviewed. He admitted that he exchanged sexual messages with a female who lived \nin State A, and that he was aware that she was 13 to 15 years old. He explained that he \ndid not believe everything on the Internet, \u201cnothing\u2019s real,\u201d and that it would be weird for \na 13-year-old to be on the Internet actively participating in their interactions like she did. \nHe admitted that they discussed things that he would like to do to her, but he had no \nintention of actually doing anything. He also admitted that he sent her a video of himself \nin which he was naked. (Tr. at 45; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5; AE H) \nA forensic examination was conducted of Applicant\u2019s cell phone. It was reported \nthat \u201c[a]n image of suspected child pornography was located, but appeared to be \nassociated with malicious software, as no additional indications were found [that] the \nuser intentionally searched for, or possessed child pornography.\u201d (GE 5; AE F) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant was charged in November 2020 with multiple offenses under the \nUniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), including three specifications of attempting to \ncommit lewd acts on a child under the age of 16; soliciting the detective to send him \nimages of child pornography; and possessing child pornography. The charges were \nreferred to a general court-martial in February 2021. (Tr. at 43; Applicant\u2019s response to \nSOR; GE 5; AE F) \nApplicant requested an under other than honorable conditions discharge in lieu of \ntrial by court-martial. In his request, he admitted that he was \u201cguilty of one or more of \nthe specifications against [him] or of a lesser-included offense contained therein which \nalso authorizes the imposition of a bad conduct discharge or dishonorable discharge.\u201d \nThe request was approved, and he was discharged in April 2021. (Tr. at 48-49, 66-67; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 5) \nApplicant responded to interrogatories in February 2022. He answered \u201cTrue\u201d to \nthe following statement, \u201cBetween February and April 2019 you admitted you \nexchanged messages, photos and a video (all sexual in nature) with an individual whom \nyou believed to be a female between the age of 13 and 15 years old residing in [State \nA].\u201d He added, \u201cAll information above is correct. I did exchange photos and video with a \nperson I thought to be a female.\u201d (GE 5) \nApplicant testified that he went on the Internet for adult companionship, and that \nhe was not looking for an underage girl. He stated that people lie about their age on the \nInternet, as he did, and he assumed that the \u201cgirl\u201d was lying. He asserted that he had no \nintention of meeting her. He denied ever possessing child pornography. (Tr. at 37-44, \n53, 62, 66-69) \nApplicant expressed remorse for his conduct. His wife is aware of his actions, the \ncharges against him, and his discharge. Many of his friends are aware of the charges. \nThe defense company that previously hired him and the company for which he was to \nstart work in January 2023 are unaware that he was discharged with an under other \nthan honorable discharge. Applicant stated that he was never asked by his employers \nabout his discharge, and he believes they would have hired him anyway. He sought \ncounseling from a chaplain while he was still on active duty. He has since had additional \ntherapy, which is ongoing. His therapist wrote that it was evident that Applicant \u201cwas \nremorseful for the past incident and has been making great effort to move forward with \nimproving his marriage and family life.\u201d Applicant considers himself completely \nrehabilitated, and he assured that similar conduct would never recur. (Tr. at 46-47, 49-\n55, 62-65, 67-68; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE K) \nApplicant was evaluated at his own expense in July 2022 by a licensed \npsychologist with extensive experience in forensic and clinical psychology. A report of \nthe evaluation was issued in August 2022. The psychologist determined that Applicant \ndid not have a mental health condition. He concluded that Applicant\u2019s \u201cillegal actions are \nnot, in fact, a sign of moral turpitude or any aberrant sexual impulses.\u201d He accepted that \nApplicant was not seeking an underage partner when he entered the chat room, and \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat Applicant presumed the person was lying about her age. (Tr. at 71-86; AE J, K) The \npsychologist concluded: \n[Applicant\u2019s] encounter with this purported young teenager was impulsive, \nrather than planned. [Applicant] has since experienced the consequences \nof his behavior. To a great degree of psychological certainty, I have \nconcluded that [Applicant] is rehabilitated and will never again engage in \nsuch foolish behavior. [Applicant\u2019s] behavior was not part of any \ncompulsion. There is no known reason to expect that such behavior is \nsomething that [Applicant] is motivated to repeat or has any particular \ninterest in doing. \nIn sum, I have concluded that [Applicant] has learned from his mistake, \nhas benefitted from the consequences he experienced and from the \npsychotherapy that he received, and that this behavior will not recur. I \nconsider [Applicant] to have been rehabilitated and to be currently fit to \nhold a security clearance. (AE I) \nApplicant submitted documents and letters attesting to his excellent military \nservice, job performance, and moral character. He was described as \u201can exemplary \nSoldier.\u201d He is praised for his leadership, dedication, work ethic, honesty, \ntrustworthiness, professionalism, humility, reliability, judgment, proficiency, generosity, \ncompassion, empathy, maturity, and integrity. He received numerous medals and \ncommendations while he was on active duty and while working for a defense contractor. \n(GE 5; AE A-E) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern for sexual behavior is set out in AG \u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and  \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion \nor judgment.  \nThe SOR alleges the court-martial charges. Applicant\u2019s criminal sexual behavior \nreflected a severe lack of judgment and made him vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, \nand duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a), 13(c), and 13(d) are applicable. I do not find by substantial \nevidence that Applicant intentionally possessed child pornography. The part of the \nallegation alleging possession of child pornography is concluded for Applicant. \nConditions that could mitigate sexual behavior security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 14. The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress;  \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \nApplicant\u2019s sexual behavior occurred about four years ago, and there have been \nno additional incidents. He is receiving counseling. He received a favorable \npsychological evaluation, and his character evidence is excellent. However, Applicant \ncommitted serious sexual offenses involving someone who identified herself as a 13-\nyear-old child. It was actually an adult police officer. Individuals on the Internet do lie \nabout themselves, including their age and gender, but common sense dictates that \nwhen someone says they are a 13-year-old child, it should be presumed to be true, not \nthe other way around. \nThe stigma that attaches when one is charged with a sexual offense against a \nchild, or even someone pretending to be a child, is not easily cast off. Applicant\u2019s wife, \nfriends, and some other individuals are aware of his conduct and his under other than \nhonorable conditions discharge. His past and current employers are not. Applicant may \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nbe telling the truth that the employers never asked about his discharge. He is more \noptimistic than I am that he would have been hired anyway if they knew the details of \nhis conduct and discharge. \nApplicant\u2019s conduct continues to serve as a basis for coercion, exploitation, and \nduress; and it casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.1 \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 14(b), 14(c), and 14(d) are not applicable. AG \u00b6 14(e) has some applicability, but \nit is insufficient to completely mitigate the behavior. I find that sexual behavior concerns \nremain despite the presence of some mitigation. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; \nand \n(e) discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces for reasons less than \n\u201cHonorable.\u201d \nThe above discussion about Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct under sexual behavior \nis incorporated here by reference. In addition to what was discussed under that \nguideline, Applicant was discharged in lieu of trial by court-martial with an under other \nthan honorable conditions discharge. The above disqualifying conditions are applicable. \nI do not find by substantial evidence that Applicant intentionally possessed child \npornography. The part of the allegation alleging possession of child pornography is \nconcluded for Applicant. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \n1 See ISCR Case No. 09-03233 (App. Bd. Aug. 12, 2010). The Appeal Board determined that an \napplicant\u2019s child molestation offense \u201ceven though it occurred long ago, impugn[ed] his trustworthiness \nand good judgment.\u201d \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nIt has been about four years since the criminal conduct and almost two years \nsince the discharge. Nonetheless, I have unmitigated concerns under the same \nrationale discussed in the sexual behavior analysis. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during the national \nsecurity investigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s\npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \nSOR \u00b6 3.b cross-alleges the criminal conduct allegation. Applicant\u2019s criminal \nconduct reflects questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations. The conduct also created vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and \nduress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable. AG \u00b6 16(c) is not perfectly applicable because \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct is sufficient for an adverse determination under the sexual behavior \nand criminal conduct guidelines. However, the general concerns about questionable \njudgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations contained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n15 and 16(c) are established. \nI do not find by substantial evidence that Applicant intentionally possessed child \npornography. The part of the allegation alleging possession of child pornography is \nconcluded for Applicant. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nUnder the same rationale discussed above for sexual behavior, Applicant\u2019s \nconduct continues to make him vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, and duress; \nand it casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nPersonal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E, D, and J in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the sexual behavior, personal conduct, and criminal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant (except for the \nlanguage about possession of \nchild \npornography, \nwhich \nis \nconcluded for Applicant) \nParagraph 2, Guideline D: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant (except for the \nlanguage about possession of \nchild \npornography, \nwhich \nis \nconcluded for Applicant) \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant (except for the \nlanguage about possession of \nchild \npornography, \nwhich \nis \nconcluded for Applicant) \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEdward W. Loughran \nAdministrative Judge \n10 \n",

Despite experiencing \nsignificant periods of unemployment and underemployment, Applicant acted responsibly \nconsidering his circumstances. He made a good-faith effort to pay his delinquent \naccounts and has rehabilitated his finances. Clearance is granted.  \nStatement of the Case \nOn December 17, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudication Facility (DCSA CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) \ndetailing security concerns under the financial considerations guideline. This action was \ntaken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry, signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended; as well \nas DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive); and the Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, implemented \non June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDCSA adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance and recommended that the \ncase be submitted to a Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) administrative \njudge for a determination whether to revoke his security clearance. Applicant timely \nanswered the SOR and requested a hearing.  \nBecause of Applicant\u2019s work-related travel schedule between October 2022 and \nFebruary 2023, the parties were unable to settle on a hearing date until February 8, \n2023, for February 23, 2023. DOHA issued the Notice of Hearing on February 13, 2023. \nAt the hearing, which proceeded as scheduled, I advised Applicant of the notice\nrequirement in Directive Additional Procedural Guidance \u00b6 E3.1.8 that he be given 15 \ndays advance notice of the time and place of the hearing. He waived the notice\nrequirement and confirmed his desire to continue with the hearing as scheduled. (Tr. 8-\n9) \n \n \nI appended to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HE) I, the disclosure letter the \nGovernment sent to Applicant, dated March 1, 2022. I admitted as HE II and HE III, debt \nmatrices prepared by the Government and the Applicant, respectively. I admitted \nGovernment\u2019s Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A and F, without \nobjection. After the hearing, Applicant made three post-hearing submissions. (Tr. 15) \nSubmission 1, dated March 29, 2023, and April 2, 2023, consisted of an email \nproviding a debt status update and a debt matrix, which are appended to the record as \nHE IV (2 pages). Submission 1 also contained 16 pages of supporting documentation. \nThe Government did not object to Submission 1 on April 5, 2023. The Government\u2019s \nresponse is appended to the record as HE V (1 page). Submission 2, Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to HE V, is a second debt status update email, dated April 6, 2023, and is \nappended to the record as HE VI (1 page). Applicant sent Submission 3 on April 26, \n2023, consisting of a debt status update, a debt matrix, and 18 pages of supporting \ndocumentation. The April 26 email and debt matrix are appended to the record as HE \nVII (2 pages). Two of the documents in Submissions 1 and 3 were duplicates of AE A \nand E. I identified the remaining 15 documents as AE G through U. \nOn October 23, 2023, I sent the Final Exhibit List, along with copies of HE IV \nthough VII and a copy of the documents identified as AE G through U. I ordered the \nparties to review the Final Exhibit List and certify its completeness and accuracy by \nOctober 27, 2023. The Government certified the Final Exhibit List on October 23, 2023. \nApplicant did not respond. Based on the Government\u2019s response, AE G through U, are \nadmitted without objection. The Final Exhibit List and the Government\u2019s certification are \nappended to the record as Appellate Exhibit (AP Ex) I and II, respectively.  \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, 68, has held a security clearance since 1987.

He has worked for his current employer since April 2021. He \ncompleted his most recent security clearance application in October 2013, disclosing \n$87,000 in delinquent debt for the deficiency balance on a repossessed vehicle and a \ncredit card. The ensuing investigation revealed other delinquent debt. The SOR alleged \nthat Applicant owed $159,459 on nine delinquent accounts. (GE 1 \u2013 5; Tr. 21-22, 44) \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began in 2014. He worked overseas for Company \n1 from 2000 to 2013, when he experienced a medical issue that required him to return \nto the United States for treatment. He did not get paid while on medical leave. At the \ntime he was earning between $180,000 and $190,000 annually. While he was out on \nmedical leave, Company 1 lost the contract on which he was working, leaving him \nunemployed after he was given medical clearance to return to work. As a result, \nApplicant was unemployed from May 2014 to April 2015. (Tr. 23-27, 38, 71) \nApplicant\u2019s wife did not work outside the home. He was solely responsible for \npaying the couple\u2019s financial obligations. During his period of unemployment, he \ndepleted his $200,000 in retirement savings and used credit cards. Sometime in 2014 or \n2015, he consulted a bankruptcy attorney. Ultimately, he decided not to pursue \nbankruptcy protection out of fear of losing the family home. (Tr. 27-28, 48-49, 70-71) \nIn May 2015, he began working for Company 2 on a federal contract. He earned \n$3,000 per month, after taxes in that position. In December 2015, he returned to \nCompany 1, earning between $72,000 and $74,000 annually, less than half of his \nprevious pay. He moved to Company 3 in February 2016, where he worked for three \nmonths, leaving in May 2016 to work for Company 4. He did not earn sufficient income \nto meet his expenses and continued to use credit cards as needed. Applicant\u2019s finances \ndid not begin to recover until he began working for Company 4 in May 2016, earning \nbetween $200,000 and $210,000. At some point, the contract transitioned to Company \n5, Applicant\u2019s current employer, but his salary remained the same. (Tr. 32, 39-41) \nAfter returning to work, Applicant prioritized paying off small accounts, anything \nranging from $200 to $1,500. He paid off a total of $20,000 to $25,000 in small \naccounts. He then focused on paying debts in his wife\u2019s name. He believes that he has \npaid between $40,000 to $50,000 of her delinquent debt. He then started to address the \ndebts accumulated in his name, paying off between $20,000 and $25,000. (Tr. 32, 39-\n41) \nIn 2017 or 2018, the lender holding the student loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and \n1.d, secured a garnishment against Applicant. He initially obtained the loans to finance \nthe college education of one of his three children. The garnishment, almost $1,600 per \npay period, remained in effect until April 2020, when President Biden instituted the \nstudent loan payment pause during the covid-19 pandemic. He believes he paid \nbetween $72,000 and $80,000 toward the garnishment. During the payment pause, the \nstudent loans were considered to be in good standing. Although the payment pause \nwas lifted as of October 2023, garnishments and other collection efforts will not resume \nuntil sometime in 2024. It is not clear if garnishees are required to make payments \noutside the order until the Government resumes the garnishments. (See, \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhttps://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19) During the payment pause, \nApplicant has set the garnishment amount aside for savings. (AE B; Tr. 33, 59-61, 76) \nHe also initiated payment plans on the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c ($24,360), \n1.e ($20,736), and 1.f ($11,950), which are held by the same creditor. However, the \naccounts are being collected by three separate companies. In approximately 2017, he \nbegan paying $50 per month toward each account. The credit reports in the record, \nwhich range in dates from November 2020 to March 2022, show that the account \nbalances have been decreasing in accordance with the plans. He resolved the account \nin SOR \u00b6 1.c in April 2023. In March 2023, he increased the monthly amount for SOR \u00b6 \n1.e from $50 per month to $300 per month. He has established payment dates with the \ncreditor for each month through July 2024. A March 2023, letter from the agency \ncollecting SOR \u00b6 1.f, confirms the information in the credit reports that the account \nbalance is decreasing according to the $50 per month payment plan. (AE C-D, F-K; Tr. \n51-57) \nIn April 2023, Applicant resolved the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h ($4,904), a credit \ncard. He also resolved the medical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i ($1,027). Applicant \ntestified at the hearing that he had not made any payments on the debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($33,281) and 1.g ($10,016). Unbeknownst to Applicant, the creditor issued a \n1099-C canceling SOR \u00b6 1.a in 2018, three years before the SOR was issued. He was \nalso unaware the creditor holding SOR \u00b6 1.g, cancelled that debt in 2021. He has asked \nhis accountant to refile his federal and state income tax returns for those years to reflect \nthe debt cancellation. Applicant has also provided documentation that he satisfied a \nnon-SOR credit card debt for $4,160. (AE E, L-R; Tr. 49, 57-59) \nIn addition to the SOR debts, Applicant has also been paying federal and state \nincome tax liabilities for the 2019 and 2020 tax years.  He did not have sufficient income \ntax withheld from his pay during those years. He believes that he owes $15,000 federal \nand state income taxes combined. He pays $420 toward the federal income tax liability \nand $400 toward the state income tax liability, each month. (AE T-U; Tr. 65-69) \nApplicant provided a February 2023 credit report showing that he has a credit \nscore of 765. His credit report shows that he is not currently overly reliant on credit, \nwith only 19% credit usage. Applicant has $26,000 in cash savings. He has started to \nrecoup his retirement savings, which are now $50,000. (AE A; 62-63)  \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record.  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nFailure to meet one\u2019s financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \nor sensitive information. (AG \u00b6 18). The SOR alleged that Applicant owed $159,459 on \nnine delinquent accounts. Each of the alleged debts is reported as delinquent in the \ncredit reports in the record. The record supports the application of the following financial \nconsiderations disqualifying conditions: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe record also supports the application of the following mitigating conditions: \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of unemployment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and,  \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant did not incur debt under circumstances that indicate irresponsible \nbehavior. He did not have an unwillingness to pay his debts, rather an inability to do so. \nHe became unemployed for 12 months after having to leave the contract on which he \nwas working to get medical treatment. He was then underemployed for another 12 \nmonths, earning less than half of his pre-unemployment salary. During these two years \nof unemployment and underemployment he incurred the debts alleged in the SOR.  \nHe acted responsibly by beginning to address his debt when he returned to full \nemployment and could afford to do so. Despite paying a garnishment that captured \n$3,000 of his monthly income for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d from 2017 to 2020, Applicant also \npaid off three of the SOR debts (\u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.h, and 1.i), totaling $30,291 as well at least \n$25,000 in non-SOR debts. He has ongoing payment plans for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e. and 1.f, as \nwell as over $800 per month toward his federal and state tax liabilities.  Applicant has \nalso acted responsibly by saving the $3,000 each month that was previously taken for \nthe student loan garnishment. His efforts are not diminished by the fact that the \ncreditors holding the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.g, canceled the debts. \nFurthermore, the credit reports in the record provide strong evidence to mitigate the \nfinancial considerations concerns. The credit reports are evidence that Applicant has \nrehabilitated his credit and has developed a favorable record of repayment as indicated \nby his above average credit score.  \nBased on the record, I have no doubts regarding Applicant\u2019s suitability for access \nto classified information. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-\nperson factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). Security clearance adjudications are not debt collection \nproceedings. Rather the purpose of the adjudication is to make \u201can examination of a \nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is \nan acceptable security risk.\u201d (AG \u00b6 2(a)) Here, Applicant\u2019s financial problems do not \nraise any behavior that indicates poor self-control, or an intentional unwillingness to \nfollow rules and regulations that may hinder his ability to properly handle or safeguard \nclassified information. A fair and commonsense assessment of the record evidence as a \nwhole supports a conclusion that the security concerns raised under the financial \nconsiderations guideline are mitigated.  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT\n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.i:\n \n  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

(Answer; Tr. at 5-6, 15-24, 26-30, 59-60, 63, 69-71, 77-81; GE 1; AE P-T) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had four delinquent student loans totaling \napproximately $84,221 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b, 1.g, 1.i) and six delinquent consumer debts \ntotaling approximately $129,849 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.f, 1.h, 1.j).

When he became re-employed in October 2015 after his first period of \nunemployment, his annual income was reduced from $325,000 to $160,000. He also cited \nto his father\u2019s significant and costly health issues in 2016, for which he assisted financially. \nHe also financially contributed to his daughter\u2019s expenses, to include her educational \ncosts. He acknowledged that he financially contributed approximately $100,000 between \n2009 and 2014 to his then-girlfriend. He began to tackle his financial delinquencies, which \nincluded several debts that were not alleged in the SOR, once he secured employment \nin June 2017. He hired an attorney in April 2019 to assist him. He noted that the COVID-\n19 pandemic delayed his attempts with his creditors to resolve his debts.

He stated that he timely paid SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b until his first period of unemployment in 2015. In 2016, he applied for \ndeferment for SOR \u00b6 1.g but was unsuccessful because the loan had been returned to \nthe lender due to non-payment. He thought he brought all his student loans current in \n2017, to include entering a $500 monthly payment plan for SOR \u00b6 1.i, but he learned in \n2019 that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b were not included in his student loan repayment plan. He \npaid SOR \u00b6 1.i, in accordance with his payment plan, in June 2019. He stated that the \ncreditor for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b was unwilling to work with him when he contacted it in \n2019, and then the COVID-19 pandemic hampered his ability to work with the creditor to \nresolve these loans. In August 2022, he wrote a letter to the three major credit bureaus \nto verify SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.g but stated that he had not received a response. His \nattorney was assisting him with resolving SOR \u00b6 1.g. He intends to establish a repayment \nplan to resolve them.

As a 1099 employee, he would use his credit cards for four-\nto-six-month periods while he was not being paid, and he then would pay his credit card \nbalances once he was paid. His periods of unemployment affected his ability to repay his \ncredit cards. He also acknowledged that he used his credit cards to provide his then-\ngirlfriend with financial assistance, as previously discussed.

He stated \nthat when he contacted the credit card company underlying both debts in approximately \n2017, the company told him that the debt was purchased by a third-party collection \nagency. The credit reports list both debts with different account numbers aside from the \nlast four digits, which are identical. SOR \u00b6 1.c is reported on all the credit reports. Although \nSOR \u00b6 1.h is reported with a zero balance on the latest credit reports from October 2021 \nand November 2022, it remains listed as a $21,167 charged-off account. He stated that \nhis attorney was assisting him with resolving this debt, and he sent a letter to the collection \nagency in approximately April 2022 directing all communication to his attorney.

In \nJanuary 2022, Applicant\u2019s supervisor of one year praised Applicant\u2019s performance and \ndedication to the mission. Another individual, a technical lead for the same company who \nworked extensively with Applicant daily since 2020, noted Applicant\u2019s exemplary \nprofessionalism for which he received an award in 2021. Two individuals, one who was \nApplicant\u2019s colleague and supervisor between approximately 2009 and 2013 and the \nother who was Applicant\u2019s immediate supervisor from approximately 2017 to 2020, \nhighlighted Applicant\u2019s skills, patience, and ability to work under pressure. Applicant also \nreceived a star performer certificate between approximately 2020 and 2022. (Answer; Tr. \nat 23-25; AE P, V) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information).   \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of not being able to pay his debts. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s periods of unemployment, his decrease in pay when he was re\u00ad\nemployed in 2015, and his father\u2019s health issues are conditions beyond his control that \ncontributed to his financial problems. The first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full \napplication of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that he acted responsibly under his \ncircumstances. Applicant paid SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.i, and I find those allegations in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. \nApplicant has neither established a plan to resolve his remaining outstanding debts \nnor taken significant actions to implement a plan. Since unsuccessfully applying for a \ndeferment of his student loan in SOR \u00b6 1.g in 2016 and learning in 2019 that his student \nloans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b were not included in his student loan repayment plan, \nApplicant has made little effort to resolve these three outstanding student loans. He stated \nthat he contacted the creditor for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b in 2019 and unsuccessfully \nattempted to negotiate a payment plan, and then the COVID-19 pandemic hampered his \nability to work with the creditor to resolve these loans. His next and last efforts came in \nAugust 2022, when he wrote a letter to the credit bureaus to simply verify SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, \n1.b, and 1.g. \nApplicant has not provided documentation to corroborate his claims that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.c and 1.h are duplicate accounts, or that SOR \u00b6 1.j is associated with SOR \u00b6 1.i. All four \nof these debts are reported with different account numbers on the credit reports.

He has also not made any \neffort to resolve SOR \u00b6 1.j, other than simply letting it fall off his credit report. He stated \nthat he contacted the creditors for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.h between 2017 and 2019 \nbut was unable to negotiate payment plans. He also stated that his attorney was assisting \nhim with resolving these debts. Other than sending a letter in April 2022 to the creditor for \nSOR \u00b6 1.c directing all communication to his attorney, and a letter in August 2022 to the \nthree major credit bureaus to simply verify SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f, he has not made efforts \nto address these outstanding debts. There is no evidence in the record about whether his \npayments for his outstanding student loans are paused under the COVID-19 relief for \nfederal student loans. While he received financial counseling and he has the means to \nresolve his remaining debts, he has not done so. I find that Applicant\u2019s financial issues \ncontinue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s honorable military service and his favorable \ncharacter evidence. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts \nas to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant \nhas not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c: \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nSubparagraphs 1.e - 1.h: \nSubparagraph 1.i: \nSubparagraph 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nFor Applicant \nAgainst Applicant \nFor Applicant \nAgainst Applicant \n Conclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He is co-owner of an Aerospace company that does defense contracting. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. Guideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse The SOR alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their intended purpose and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or psychological impairment and raise questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth under this guideline. 1.a. Applicant used marijuana with varying frequencies from about October 1992 through at least October 2019.

Applicant submitted three Post-Hearing exhibits, referred to as \nApplicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits G through I, which were admitted into evidence.  \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on September 6, 2022. \nProcedural Rulings \nThe Government requested I take administrative notice of certain facts relating to \nthe country of Colombia. Department Counsel provided a six-page summary of the \nfacts, supported by seven Government documents pertaining to Colombia, identified as \nGovernment Exhibit H-I. \nThe documents provide elaboration and context for the \nsummary. Applicant had no objection. (Tr. p. 18.) I took administrative notice of the \nfacts included in the U.S. Government reports. They are limited to matters of general \nknowledge, not subject to reasonable dispute. They are set out in the Findings of Fact. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 48 years old. He is unmarried, but resides with his girlfriend, and \nhas no children. He has a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Engineering. He is co-owner of an \nAerospace company that does defense contracting. He is seeking to obtain a security \nclearance in connection with his employment. \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \nThe SOR alleges that the Applicant has used controlled substances, to include \nthe misuse of prescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or psychological \nimpairment and raise questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with \nlaws, rules, and regulations. Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth under \nthis guideline. \n1.a. \nApplicant used marijuana with varying frequencies from about October 1992 \nthrough at least October 2019. He stated that he began using marijuana in his early \nteens and through college. After college he continued to use it, but not as often, \naveraging once every few years. In 2017, he used it to treat pain for a chronic back \ncondition, but it did not help. He continued to use it about twice a month or so to help \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nhim sleep. This use continued up until October 2019. Applicant stated that his most \nrecent use of marijuana he believed to be legal based on his state law and the Federal \nnon-enforcement stance. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B.) He stated that he now understands \nthat this was not correct. He stated that he had no intention to do anything illegal or \nagainst Federal law. (Tr. pp. 46-49, and Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR.) \n1,b, \nIn March 2017, Applicant provided a 1.75 million dollar loan to a company that \nwas in the business of cultivating marijuana. He states that he has done about 45 of \nthose real estate loans over the past 10 to 15 years. (Tr. pp. 60-67, and Applicant\u2019s \nAnswer to SOR.) \n1.c. \nA few months later in July 2017, he made another loan to a company to allow \nthem to build a marijuana greenhouse and cultivate marijuana. The borrower ran out of \nmoney, could no longer make the payments on the greenhouse, and the project \ndissolved. In the beginning, Applicant\u2019s intent was to become a part-owner in the \nbusiness. This was not a real estate loan, but a convertible note. It was a loan in the \nbeginning, with the option of converting into ownership of the company once it became \nan operating company cultivating marijuana. Applicant was unable to exercise the \noption, which would have given him 10 percent of the company, had it become \nsuccessful. (Tr. pp. 64-67, and Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR.) \nApplicant states that he has no intention of being involved in the marijuana \nindustry again, nor is he sensitive to having his past involvement be known by others or \nvulnerable to coercion due to his past involvement. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D, and Answer \nto SOR.) \nGuideline B \u2013 Foreign Influence \nThe SOR alleges that the Applicant has foreign contacts and interests, including \nbut not limited to, business, financial, and property interests, that are of a national \nsecurity concern if they create circumstances in which the individual may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in \na way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure or \ncoercion by any foreign interest. Applicant admits allegations 2.b., and 2.c., and denies \nallegation 2.a. \n2.a. \nApplicant\u2019s girlfriend is a citizen of Colombia.  He met her in October 2014.  \nSince 2015, she has resided with the Applicant.  He denies that she is an \nundocumented immigrant, or that she was an undocumented immigrant when he met \nher.  Applicant submitted copies of her work permits from June 2016 to June 2017.  \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)  When he met her, she was working to obtain her residency.  It \nwas his understanding that she came to the United States on a fianc\u00e9e visa.  The \nrelationship failed and she overstayed her visa.  He states that she was granted her \nresidency in 2020.  She is now working towards obtaining her green card.

He \nrecently retired as a Sergeant Major. (Tr. p. 71.) Applicant stated that he does not \nprovide any financial support to his girlfriend\u2019s brother. However, he does pay for \nmedical school tuition in Colombian for his girlfriend\u2019s brother\u2019s daughter. She got into \nmedical school at sixteen. Applicant offered to pay for her tuition. Medical school \n(university) in Colombia is six years. Applicant pays the tuition with his credit card. He \nhas already provided about $25,000 in tuition over the past two years. (Tr. pp. 72-74.) \nApplicant stated that he has visited Colombia on two occasions, and his most \nrecent visit was in March 2022. During his visit he met some of his girlfriend\u2019s family. \nHer mother passed away many years ago, and her father is not in the picture. She has \neight siblings. All but three of them live in Colombia. Applicant is not sure if any of his \ngirlfriend\u2019s siblings, other than her brother, are affiliated in any way with the Colombian \nGovernment. (Tr. pp. 76-77.) \n2.c. \nSince 2017, Applicant has provided multi-million dollar financial investments and \nloans to some foreign national business partners. \n(Tr. pp. 79-83, and Applicant\u2019s \nAnswer to the SOR.) The following information provides some background: \nAfter graduating from college, in 1998, Applicant started a business that sold \nvitamins and supplements on-line. Over the years, he has grown the company to be \nvery successful. At its peak in 2014, the business was worth about 77 million dollars. \nHe states that his company is currently worth about 20 million dollars. He continues to \nown and operate the company. (Tr. pp. 57-58.) \nIn 2015/2016, Applicant was introduced to his now partner who owned a defense \ncontracting company. At that time, they began discussing partnership possibilities. In \nmid-2018, Applicant formally joined his partner and started their company working with \nthe defense industry. Applicant had been using marijuana, and continued using it up \nuntil October 2019, when he completed a security clearance application. Applicant is \nthe co-owner of a company that does contracting with the Defense Department. \nApplicant states that there are three full-time employees, Applicant\u2019s partner and co-\nowner, who is also the Facility Security Officer, and two aircraft mechanics. \nThe \ncompany owns 10 aircraft, and leases a few more. \nApplicant requires a security \nclearance in order to perform his duties for the company. He admits that he entered this \nindustry later in life, and that he did not always follow Federal law. (Tr. pp. 46-50, and \nApplicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit H.) \nOver the years, Applicant has also made other financial investments which have \namplified his income. Applicant has been in the business of providing first and second \ntrustee loans on real estate investments. \nHe explained that he loans money to \ninvestors and takes ownership of the deed of title as collateral. On various occasions, \nhe has funded multi-million dollar financial investments and provided loans to foreign \nnationals for their businesses. He explained that at times there are multiple private \ninvestors in a deal, sometimes up to four, and he does not know if they are foreign \nnationals. He does know that on many occasions, owners of the real estate have \nforeign names and may be foreign nationals. In the past, Applicant has not been \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconcerned as to who he is giving the loan to.  There are several scenarios in which \nApplicant may loan money to a foreign national.  Applicant is either loaning money to an \nindividual to purchase the real property, or is loaning money to a property owner to \nallow them to renovate or flip it.  However, he does not vet these people.  Typically, his \nbroker finds the deal for him, and then contacts him to see if he is interested. \nApplicant\u2019s only concern about the deal is the value of the property.  In the event that \nthe loan goes unpaid, he gets the property, and the property must be worth his loan. \nThe largest loan that Applicant has funded has been 2.5 million dollars.  (Tr. pp. 60-67, \nand Applicant\u2019s Exhibit H.)   \nApplicant states that he has been a \u201cpretty active investor.\u201d He has funded at \nleast 45 secured trust deed loans through a licensed broker where he participates as \nthe investor. He has met only two of the borrowers since he started funding loans about \nnine years ago. Some of the borrowers are likely foreign citizens. The loans are made \nat conservative loan-to-value ratios and a deed of trust is recorded with the county. \nApplicant states that in the event of non-payment, a foreclosure process is initiated, and \nthe property liquidated to return funds to the lender, eliminating any risk of them \nwithholding fund to exert leverage.  (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR.) \nApplicant owns 16 rental units, which generate half a million dollars per year in \nrent, about half of which is income. He also owns half of a large industrial building in \nanother state which is used for his vitamin company, but would rent for approximately \none million per year to a third party. His assets are on average, one third stocks, one \nthird loans/cash, and one third real estate equity. He stated that his total assets are \ncurrently valued at about 30 million dollars. His goal is to divest himself of the vitamin \ncompany within a year and concentrate on defense contracting and passive \ninvestments (real estate ownership, real estate lending, and publicly traded stocks). \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit H.) \nIn assessing the heightened risk created by holding a security clearance, the \nApplicant\u2019s ties to a country are important. Under the particular facts of this case, I have \ntaken administrative notice of the information provided concerning the Country of \nColombia. Colombia is a constitutional, multi-party republic. Colombia has endured a \ndecades-long conflict between government forces, paramilitaries, and antigovernment \ninsurgent groups heavily funded by the drug trade, principally the Revolutionary Armed \nForces of Colombia (FARC). Recently, there has been a significant uptick of violent \nincidents targeting Colombian security forces in various parts of the country. \nThe \nDepartment of State has issued a level 3: Reconsider travel advisory for Colombia due \nto crime, terrorism, and COVID 19, and to exercise increased caution due to civil unrest, \nand kidnapping. \nViolent crime, such as homicide, assault, and armed robbery is \nwidespread. Organized criminal activities, such as extortion, robbery, and kidnapping, \nare common in some areas. The Department of State has assessed Bogato, as being a \nhigh threat location and Cartagena as being a medium threat location for terrorism \ndirected at or affecting official U.S. government interests. There are significant human \nrights violations including unlawful or arbitrary killings; reports of torture and arbitrary \ndetention by government security forces and illegal armed groups; rape and abuse of \nwomen and children, as well as unlawful recruitment of child soldiers by illegal armed \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n     \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngroups, criminalization of libel, widespread corruption; violence against and forced \ndisplacement of Afro-Colombian and indigenous persons; violence against lesbian, gay, \nbisexual, transgender, and intersex persons; child labor; and killings and other violence \nagainst trade unionists. (H-1) \nA letter of recommendation from his partner and co-owner of his company, who \nalso serves as the Facility Security Officer, considers Applicant to be extremely ethical, \ntrustworthy, hardworking, and an excellent business partner. He believes that Applicant \nis transparent with him. \nHe supported Applicant\u2019s full disclosure of the all of the \ninformation about his marijuana use and his prior investment in a marijuana business. \nHe believes that Applicant understands that he will be held to the highest standards \nwhile involved in classified work.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit G.) \nA witness, who has a security clearance and military background, testified that he \nhas known the Applicant since high school and college. He has also worked for his \nvitamin company by providing programming services. He considers Applicant to be \nhonest, trustworthy and responsible. (Tr. pp. 20-26.) \nApplicant submitted a Statement of Intent dated August 16, 2022. He stated that \nhe has not been involved in any illegal drug use since the security clearance process. \nHe further stated that he is committed to abstaining from all future drug involvement. \nHe understands that any future drug involvement is grounds for revocation of his \nnational security eligibility. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains two conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and   \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nApplicant started using marijuana in 1992, knowing it was illegal under state law. \nWhen it became legal in the state, he continued to use it, notwithstanding the fact that it \nremained illegal under Federal law. He stated that he last used marijuana in 2019. \nApplicant became a partner of a defense contracting company in 2018. Applicant used \nmarijuana while working for, and then becoming a partner of, a company that contracts \nwith the defense industry. \nApplicant knew or should have known that the use of \nmarijuana is prohibited by the Defense Department. Applicant\u2019s misconduct shows \nimmaturity and irresponsibility, that is not tolerated by the Government under any \ncircumstances. Accordingly, Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse is \nfound against the Applicant. \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \nApplicant resides with his Colombian girlfriend and maintains close contact with \nher foreign relatives in Colombia, specifically, her brother and her brother\u2019s daughter.  \nApplicant\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s brother is now retired, but he was a career Colombian military \nnon-commissioned officer for the Colombian military.  His daughter attends medical \nschool in Colombia and Applicant pays her medical school tuition.   These are close \nforeign contacts.  These contacts with his girlfriend\u2019s family in Colombia and the unique \nnature of their relationship may pose a threat and negatively influence Applicant\u2019s \ndecision making, impacting the interests and security of the United States.  Under the \nparticular circumstances here, the risk-benefit analysis is applicable, and these contacts \nin Colombia do pose a significant security risk to the U.S. government.  They may \nmanipulate, induce, or influence the Applicant to help a foreign person or government in \na way that is inconsistent with the U.S. interests.   \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n9 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n     \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nApplicant lives with his Colombian girlfriend, who is not yet a naturalized citizen, \nand he maintains close contacts with not just her, but with her brother and her brother\u2019s \ndaughter in Colombia. This close relationship could present a problem for the Applicant \nand a potential risk for foreign influence. Applicant provides financial support to his \ngirlfriend\u2019s niece for her medical education in Colombia. This close relationship could \nresult in a situation that may create a divided allegiance. Full mitigation under AG \u00b6 \n8(a), 8(b), and 8(c), has not been established. \nAccordingly, Guideline B, Foreign \nInfluence, is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H and B in my whole-person analysis. An individual who holds a security \nclearance is expected to comply with the law at all times. Applicant is not a young man. \nHe is 48 years old, and is expected to comply with both Federal and state laws at all \ntimes. \nAs the owner and head of the company, one would expect much more. \nApplicant has not demonstrated the requisite good judgment or level of maturity needed \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfor access to classified information. \nApplicant knew or should have known the \nrequirements associated with holding a security clearance and should have known that \nany illegal drug use is not tolerated by the Defense Department under any \ncircumstances. Under the particular facts of this case, Applicant is not an individual in \nwhom the Government can be confident to know that he will always follow rules and \nregulations and do the right thing, even when no one is looking. Applicant does not \nmeet the qualifications for a security clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse, and \nForeign Influence security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a., 1.b., and 1.c. \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a., 2.b., and 2.c. \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n11 \n",

He did not answer the cross-allegations at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 4.a. He included a brief narrative statement with his answer. Applicant\u2019s admission is incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 47 years old. He was married from 1999 until August 2013, when he and his wife divorced. They have four children, all born between 1999 and 2005. Applicant has been employed in the defense industry since about 2007, in the field of logistics. He has worked for his current employer since August 2018. (Item 3) On his June 2019 SCA, Applicant disclosed prior U.S. Government background investigations in 2007 and 2012. He also disclosed that, in about January 2018, he had a security clearance eligibility or access authorization denied, suspended, or revoked, by an AGA. He reported that he had held a clearance without incident since 2007, but that the AGA had revoked his access to a particular facility, following an inconclusive polygraph result. (Item 3 at 38-39) Government Item 4 is a Clearance Decision Statement (CDS) from the AGA, dated May 9, 2018.

After a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 47 years old. He was married from 1999 until August 2013, when he \nand his wife divorced. They have four children, all born between 1999 and 2005. \nApplicant has been employed in the defense industry since about 2007, in the field of \nlogistics. He has worked for his current employer since August 2018. (Item 3) \nOn his June 2019 SCA, Applicant disclosed prior U.S. Government background \ninvestigations in 2007 and 2012. He also disclosed that, in about January 2018, he had \na security clearance eligibility or access authorization denied, suspended, or revoked, \nby an AGA. He reported that he had held a clearance without incident since 2007, but \nthat the AGA had revoked his access to a particular facility, following an inconclusive \npolygraph result. (Item 3 at 38-39) \nGovernment Item 4 is a Clearance Decision Statement (CDS) from the AGA, \ndated May 9, 2018. The CDS notes as background that Applicant had held access to \nsensitive compartmented information (SCI) since March 2008 through AGA 1, and then \nwas indoctrinated for SCI access with AGA 2 in September 2014, pending final \nadjudication.

(Item 4 at 1) During a third \ninterview, in February 2015, he revealed the following security-significant information: \n\uf0b7 Applicant advised that he solicited and paid a prostitute for oral sex three \ntimes, once in the early 2000s, once in 2009 or 2010, and once in spring \n2013. On each occasion, he went to an area known to be frequented by \nprostitutes. A female approached his car at a stop light and he allowed her \nto get in. They drove to an alley and she performed oral sex on him, for \nwhich he paid $20. (Item 4 at 2) (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 3.a, 4.a) \n\uf0b7 Applicant reported a history of excessive alcohol consumption. His alcohol \nconsumption was moderate until 2011 or 2012, when it increased \nsignificantly after he learned of his wife\u2019s infidelity. He would become \nintoxicated twice weekly by drinking whiskey and vodka. On one instance \nin winter 2012, he passed out on the street in front of his house. He awoke \nin bed after someone helped him inside. (Item 4 at 2) (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 4.a) \n\uf0b7 Applicant also acknowledged that on five or six occasions between 1990 \n(when he was underage) and 2014, he operated a motor vehicle while \nknowingly intoxicated. On two occasions in December 2014, he consumed \nwhiskey while driving. (Item 4 at 2) (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 3.a, 4.a) \nApplicant had a fourth interview in July 2015. It revealed no security significant \ninformation. He had a fifth interview in December 2018 that revealed the following \ninformation: \n\uf0b7 Applicant reiterated facts about his prior solicitations of prostitutes, as \ndiscussed above, and added that he had consumed alcohol in his car, \nwhile driving, prior to the 2013 solicitation. He also disclosed that he \nsimilarly solicited and paid a prostitute for oral sex, once in 2015, twice in \nMay or June 2017, and once in July 2017, under similar circumstances to \nthose as previously described during his third interview.

(Item 4 at 4) \nAs part of an interrogatory from DOHA, Applicant was given the opportunity to \nreview, correct, and adopt as accurate the summaries of his interviews with the AGA \ninvestigators, discussed above.

(Item 5) \nApplicant also affirmed the accuracy of the summary of a security clearance \nbackground interview he had in September 2019 following his June 2019 SCA with an \nagent of the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM). During that interview, he \ndiscussed the fact that he was subject to two polygraph interviews with the AGA. He \nasserted that he was told that one of the interviews was inconclusive, and that he \npassed the other one. He acknowledged that, in January 2018, he was told that the \nAGA had revoked his access. Unlike in his interviews with the AGA, in his September \n2019 OPM interview, Applicant did not address his prior engagement with prostitutes or \nhis history of alcohol involvement. (Item 5 at 8) \nIn his December 2021 interrogatory response, Applicant provided updated \ninformation about his alcohol consumption. He said he no longer consumed alcohol and \ndid not intend to do so in the future. He said the last time he drank to intoxication was \n\u201cyears ago\u201d after he learned of his wife\u2019s infidelity. He could not recall the last time he \ndrove under the influence of alcohol. He denied having been charged with any DUI or \nDWI offenses and none were revealed elsewhere in the record. Applicant also said he \nhad not solicited or engaged in sexual acts with a prostitute since July 2017. (Item 5) \nUnder Guideline D, Applicant denied SOR \u00b6 1.a, which alleged that between \n2010 and July 2017, he engaged in sexual activity with prostitutes while granted access \nto classified information. He also denied SOR \u00b6 1.b, which alleged that during 2017, he \nsearched internet personal ads for prostitutes on multiple occasions. (Item 2) \nUnder Guideline G, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6 2.a, which alleged that, from \nsummer 2014 to December 2014, he drove on multiple occasions while under the \ninfluence of alcohol, and while consuming alcohol. He denied SOR \u00b6 2.b, which alleged \nthat from late 2011 to about September 2013, he drank alcohol to intoxication about \ntwice a week, and that once in 2012, he was so intoxicated that he passed out on the \nstreet in front of his home.

I DO NOT request a hearing. (Item 2) (Emphasis in \noriginal) \nApplicant did not elaborate and did not respond to the Government\u2019s FORM, so \nhe provided no additional information in mitigation. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has noted, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior \nAG \u00b6 12 expresses the security concern for sexual conduct: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \nApplicant denied both SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b under Guideline D. This puts the \nburden on the Government to establish the allegations. Both allegations, however, are \nestablished by their reference in Item 5, the summaries of Applicant\u2019s interviews with \nthe AGA investigators in which he disclosed the conduct. Further, Applicant also \nadopted those interview summaries as accurate in his interrogatory response to DOHA, \nwithout comment. His assertion in his answer that he was \u201ccoerced\u201d by the polygrapher \nis insufficient to overcome the evidence that he accepted the resulting interview \nstatements as accurate in his interrogatory response. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b are therefore \nestablished.  \nThere is sufficient evidence to find that Applicant engaged the sexual services of \nprostitutes on multiple occasions between 2010 and 2017. Accordingly, his conduct, as \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, satisfies AG \u00b6\u00b6 13(a), 13(c), and 13(d). The fact that Applicant \nwas granted access to classified information at the time, as also alleged, is established, \nbut that circumstance, while also poor judgment, does not fall squarely within the \nlanguage of any disqualifying condition under Guideline D. \nFor several reasons, SOR \u00b6 1.b is not established as a Guideline D security \nconcern. Since Applicant never actually engaged the services of any prostitutes when \nhe searched the internet for them, his internet searches themselves would not constitute \nsecurity-significant sexual behavior unless it involved minors, and there is no such \nindication here. Only once did he get as far as exchanging a text message. He then had \nsecond thoughts, and broke off contact. No Guideline D disqualifying conditions apply to \nSOR \u00b6 1.b. \nAG \u00b6 14 sets forth the potentially applicable mitigating conditions for sexual \nconduct: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \nand \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress.  \nApplicant\u2019s actions put him in position where he might have been subject to \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. He disclosed his engagement with prostitutes during \nmore than one AGA interview, but did not disclose his actions during his most recent \n2019 background interview with the OPM. He persisted in failing to accept responsibility \nfor his actions by denying the related allegations in the SOR. Thus, he did not fully \nestablish that his behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress. AG \u00b6 14(c) only partially applies. \nApplicant engaged the services of prostitutes for money on multiple occasions \nbetween 2010 and 2017, conduct which occurred both during his marriage and several \nyears after his marriage ended. The fact that he held a security clearance, while not a \ndisqualifying factor, further weighs against mitigation. Significantly, his activity continued \nafter he disclosed it during his 2015 AGA interview, and it resumed as recently as 2017, \nduring the investigation and adjudication of his clearance with the AGA. Even though \nmore than five years have passed, I cannot conclude that Applicant\u2019s actions happened \nso long ago, so infrequently, or under such unusual circumstances, and no longer casts \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. AG \u00b6 14(b) does not apply. \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set forth in AG \u00b6 21: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following disqualifying conditions are applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with an alcohol \nuse disorder; and  \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nApplicant was a moderate drinker until about 2011, when his drinking increased \nafter he learned of his wife\u2019s infidelity. His increased drinking continued until about \n2014. During this period, on one occasion in 2012, he passed out in front of his house. \nSOR \u00b6 2.b is established by its reference in the AGA interview summaries, which he \nadopted without reservation in his interrogatory response. Applicant drove while \nimpaired or intoxicated by alcohol on multiple occasions. In 2014, he consumed alcohol \nwhile he was driving. Even if his actions did not lead to charges or citations, they are \nsecurity significant, as alleged and established in SOR \u00b6 2.a. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c) \napply. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; and  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant\u2019s excessive alcohol consumption was limited to the period between \n2011 and 2014, when he used alcohol to cope with his wife\u2019s infidelity, and as his \nmarriage was ending. Since then, Applicant has established a pattern of moderate \nconsumption. His excessive alcohol consumption was situational and based upon \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncircumstances not likely to recur. There is no indication of a current pattern of security \nsignificant alcohol consumption. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and (b) apply. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct:  \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern for criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and  \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \nApplicant\u2019s acknowledged actions with prostitutes and his drinking and driving \nconstitute criminal conduct even though no arrests, charges, or citations resulted. He \nengaged the services of prostitutes for money, drove while under the influence and \nwhile intoxicated, and consumed alcohol while driving. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and 31(b) both \napply to the cross-allegation set forth in SOR \u00b6 3.a. \nAG \u00b6 32 sets forth the potentially applicable mitigating conditions: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and  \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant engaged in criminal conduct by soliciting and paying for the services of \nprostitutes from about 2010 to 2017, and he engaged in drinking and driving between \nabout 2011 and 2014. By its very nature, criminal conduct calls into question a person's \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations; all the more so when if \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat person had been granted eligibility for access to classified information at the time. \nThe length of time he engaged in the conduct also must be considered. In that regard, \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate criminal conduct security \nconcerns. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) do not fully apply. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 details the security concern regarding personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information;  \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing; and  \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity. \nSOR \u00b6 4.a is a cross-allegation of all of Applicant\u2019s conduct under both \nGuidelines D and G (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 2.a, and 2.b), already discussed above. One of \nthose allegations (SOR \u00b6 1.a) is already \u201csufficient for an adverse determination,\u201d under \nboth Guideline D and Guideline J, so AG \u00b6 16(c) does not apply to it. However, \nengaging the services of prostitutes satisfies both AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(e)(1) and 16(g). \nAG \u00b6 16(c) is potentially applicable to the conduct in SOR \u00b6 1.b (researching \nprostitutes on the internet and texting one of them once) since it was an act of poor \njudgment. However, I conclude that the fact that Applicant then changed his mind and \nwent no further is sufficient to preclude application of AG \u00b6 16(c). \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThis leaves Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption and his admitted, but uncharged, \ndrinking and driving. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b) That conduct was mitigated under Guideline G, \nbut remains potentially disqualifying under Guideline E given the poor judgment \ninvolved, so AG \u00b6 16(c) applies. \nIn addition, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 2.a, and 2.b, as cross-alleged in SOR \u00b6 4.a, also satisfy \nthe general personal conduct security concern of AG \u00b6 15 due to Applicant\u2019s repeated \ninstances of poor judgment and failures to comply with rules and regulations that are \nclearly established. \nAG \u00b6 17 details the personal conduct mitigating conditions. The following warrant \ndiscussion: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur;  \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) applies to the cross-allegations of Applicant\u2019s alcohol involvement, \nbut does not apply to Applicant\u2019s engagement with prostitutes under Guideline E for the \nsame reasons AG \u00b6 14(b) does not apply under Guideline D. Similarly, AG \u00b6 17(e) does \nnot fully apply for the same reasons as set forth in AG \u00b6 14(c). \nAG \u00b6 17(d) does not fully apply because even though Applicant disclosed his \nengagement with prostitutes in his AGA interviews, he did not disclose it during his 2019 \nbackground interview or admit the related allegation in the SOR. As with AG \u00b6 17(c), it \nalso does not fully apply because he did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that \nhis conduct will not recur. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(f) does not apply. Applicant did not establish that the information was \nunsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability. \nAG \u00b6 17(g) applies because Applicant\u2019s engagement with prostitutes has ceased. \nIt was not unwitting, however, and, as addressed above, Applicant\u2019s actions occurred \nunder circumstances that cast doubt upon his reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or \nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines D, G, J, and E in my whole-person analysis. Since Applicant elected a \ndecision on the written record, in lieu of a hearing, I did not have the opportunity to ask \nhim questions about his conduct and his efforts towards rehabilitation. I also had no \nopportunity to observe Applicant\u2019s demeanor, and thus, to assess his credibility. \nApplicant has engaged in a pattern of extremely poor judgment, both while granted \neligibility for classified access and while his clearance eligibility was being investigated \nand adjudicated. I have also considered Applicant\u2019s actions not only as individual acts, \nbut as a pattern of troubling conduct. Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence to \nestablish that he has mitigated the security concerns in this case. He has not shown \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to \nclassified information. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3: Guideline J:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 4: Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 4.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant access to classified information. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBraden M.
