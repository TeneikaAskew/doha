Department \nCounsel was prepared to proceed on December 31, 2008. On January 6, 2009, the \ncase was assigned to another administrative judge, and on January 26, 2009, the \ncase was reassigned to me due to caseload considerations.

The Government submitted a List of Government Exhibits, \nExhibit (Ex.) I. The Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through D, which were \nreceived without objection, and testified on his own behalf. The Applicant submitted a \nList of Applicant Exhibits (Ex.

His admissions are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old program manager, who has worked for his defense \ncontractor employer since October 1986. Tr. 19-20, GE 1. Applicant has been \nemployed in defense-related work for over 25 years and during those 25 years, he has \nsuccessfully held a secret security clearance. His access to classified material was \nsuspended as a result of these proceedings. Tr. 17-20, 67-68, GE 1, AE F.  \n \nApplicant graduated from college in December 2002 with a Bachelor of Science \ndegree in mechanical engineering. GE 1. He was previously married from August \n1984 to May 1986 (estimated). That marriage ended by divorce. GE 1. He has a 24-\nyear-old son from his first marriage, who is independent and does not rely on \nApplicant for support. Tr. 16-17. Applicant remarried in July 1993, and has three \ndaughters, ages 14, 11, and 10. GE 1, Tr. 16. \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed his financial situation and \nincluded the review of his March 2006 e-QIP, his August 2008, November 2007, and \nApril 2006 credit bureau reports, his undated Response to DOHA Interrogatories, and \nhis August 2006 and April 2007 Office of Personnel Management (OPM) interviews. \nGE 1 through 7.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR identified 24 separate line items, which totaled approximately \n$33,280. As noted, Applicant admitted to 19 debts, and denied five debts. The five \ndenied debts total approximately $4,000, leaving a total of admitted debts at \napproximately $29,280. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h. is a duplicate of the debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.p. leaving 23 debts totaling approximately $32,000. Tr. 8-9, Ex. III. \n \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to \u201cpoor financial judgment\u201d that \nbegan in the \u201clate 1990\u2019s and continued through the early 2000\u2019s.\u201d Tr. 52-54, 66-67. \nSince his SOR was issued and after evaluating his options to include bankruptcy, \nApplicant retained the services of a credit counseling service on January 29, 2009. \nIncluded in this service is debt consolidation and financial counseling. On March 8, \n2009, Applicant began paying the credit counseling service by direct debit with an \ninitial payment of $1,097.00. Successive monthly payments will be $1,052.00 and will \ncontinue for 38 months. The monthly fee Applicant pays to his credit counseling \nservice is applied to the company\u2019s fee and/or debt principle. Documentation of same \nwas provided. Tr. 54-56, 67, AE D.  \n \nIn conjunction with the financial counseling Applicant received from his credit \ncounseling service, he was able to develop a viable budget and a \u201cLead Action Plan.\u201d \nAE D. In addition to the action discussed supra, Applicant will be removing his children \nfrom private school to save tuition money, and is borrowing from his 401(k) retirement \naccount to apply to his debts. Post-hearing Applicant provided updates on his \nprogress in attaining financial stability to include documentation that he has satisfied \nthe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j. and 1.u. Ex. IV, AE E \u2013 AE K. \n \nApplicant provided a recent performance review, which documents above \naverage work performance. He has enjoyed a career marked by regular promotions \nand documented achievements/accomplishments in support of the defense industry. \nAE B. Of note, he has been recognized in the development of numerous tank \nammunition and artillery programs and holds a U.S. patent for developing a classified \nprojectile. AE F. Applicant is active in his community and does volunteer work with \nJunior Achievement, local food kitchen, local organization dedicated to improving the \nlives of people with intellectual and other disabilities and their families, and serves as \na youth minister. AE F. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In \naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are \nuseful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \n\n \n4 \n \n \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n  \n  \nUnder AG 18, the Government\u2019s concern is: \n \n\u201c[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially \n\n \n5 \n \n \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.\u201d \n \n \nThe Government established that Applicant owed substantial debt as reflected \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \u2013 1.x. through his admissions and evidence presented. At the time the \nSOR was issued in August 2008, Applicant owed a number of debts. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 19, two disqualifying conditions raise a security concern: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s indebtedness stems from his admitted financial mismanagement \nthat began in the late 1990s and continued into the early 2000s. Once overextended, it \nbecame increasingly difficult for Applicant to remain current and he began a financial \ntailspin.  \n \nHaving recognized the seriousness of his situation, Applicant reviewed his \noptions to include bankruptcy and chose to retain the services of a credit counseling \nservice. He recently entered into an agreement with that service to whom he pays a \nmonthly fee by direct debit, and has sought financial counseling also offered by the \nsame service. He submitted post-hearing updates on his financial progress. He has \nestablished a credible budget. All indicators point to an individual who has taken this \nprocess quite seriously and taken what appears to be all reasonable steps to correct \nhis financial situation. What is different now as opposed to before is he has the \nmeans, tools and resolve to achieve financial responsibility. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20, there are two potentially mitigating conditions: \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and  \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) applies because Applicant sought financial counseling. While \npaying down his debts, he continues to explore strategies to improve his financial \nsituation. AG \u00b6 20(d) partially applies because Applicant initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. In short, Applicant has made \nsubstantial progress in turning his financial situation around. He has established a \nviable budget, which shows a net remainder after his monthly bills are paid. \n \nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. Applicant met his ultimate \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. I also gave \nconsiderable weight to his years of service in the defense industry, his 25 plus years \nof successfully holding a secret clearance, his recognition in the development of \nnumerous tank ammunition and artillery programs, and developing a patent for a \nclassified projective. He also is dedicated to his family and contributes substantially to \nhis community through his volunteer work. In reaching this conclusion, the whole \nperson concept was given due consideration and that analysis does support a \nfavorable decision. \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d1 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the Government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nhe is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. \u2013 1.x.:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nROBERT J.

She was \nquestioned by an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on \nAugust 17, 2007, and fully discussed her drug and alcohol use. She was open, honest, \nand candid about her drug and alcohol use at her hearing. She admitted that she \n                                                          \n3 Tr. at 26-27, 31-34, 37-39; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 3-6. \n \n4 Id. \n \n5 Tr. at 38-39; GE 1, 2. \n \n6 Tr. at 27-29, 45; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 3. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nexhibited extremely poor judgment when she used illegal drugs and when she drove \nafter drinking. She credibly testified that she will never use illegal drugs again.7 \n \nApplicant no longer associates with the people with whom she used drugs. Her \nhusband does not use drugs and rarely drinks alcohol. She did not sign a statement of \nintent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation before the hearing. I \ndirected her attention to Drug Involvement Mitigating Condition AG \u00b6 26(b)(4). She was \nunaware of this provision. She stated that she is willing to sign a statement of intent not \nto abuse any illegal drugs in the future with automatic revocation of clearance for any \nviolation. Her family, close friends and company are aware of her drug and alcohol \nhistory.8 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s company sends her on frequent deployments overseas. She has \nserved in various locations, including a three-month and a six-month tour in Iraq. She \nreceived positive performance evaluations. One supervisor recognized her superior \nperformance in Iraq. Another supervisor reported that she has done an excellent job \nand is a valued asset to their team.9 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n                                                          \n7 Tr. at 55; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2. \n \n8 Tr. at 45-46, 54-55; GE 2. \n \n9 Tr. at 29-30; AE A-E. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;  \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted; \n(d) individual is currently on parole or probation; and \n(e) violation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a court-mandated \nrehabilitation program. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nApplicant was arrested and convicted of driving with a .08% or higher blood \nalcohol level. A bench warrant was issued in February 2007, for failing to pay her fine. \nShe remains on probation until April 2009. The evidence is sufficient to raise all of the \nabove disqualifying conditions.  \n \nTwo Criminal Conduct mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and (d) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s only criminal arrest occurred in January 2006. The probation violation \nwas due to a miscommunication between Applicant and her attorney and was quickly \nrectified by her payment of the entire fine. While this is her only arrest, I am also \nconsidering her illegal use of drugs as criminal conduct. She received drug and alcohol \ncounseling and has not used illegal drugs in more than two and a half years and has not \nhad alcohol in more than two years. She has been under the treatment of a psychiatrist \nsince January 2007. Her employment record is commendable. I find there is evidence of \nsuccessful rehabilitation and Applicant\u2019s criminal behavior is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n32(a) and (d) are applicable.  \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in \nAG \u00b6 24:   \n \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nDrug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates \nfrom approved medical direction.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n(a) any drug abuse;   \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; and \n \n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s drug possession and use are sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and (c) \nas disqualifying conditions. All of her drug use since she started working for her current \nemployer in 2001 or 2002, has been while holding a security clearance. AG \u00b6 25(g) is \napplicable.  \n \nThree Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence;  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation; and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional.  \n \n \nApplicant stopped using illegal drugs in June 2006. She attended outpatient drug \nand alcohol counseling in October 2006 to January 2007. Her doctor is successfully \ntreating her depression and anxiety. She disassociated herself from her drug-using \nfriends and avoided the environment where drugs were used. She is willing to sign a \nstatement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation. She clearly, \nunequivocally, and credibly committed to remaining drug free. I find an appropriate \nperiod of abstinence and that illegal drug use is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and (b) \nare applicable. \n \nApplicant attended drug and alcohol counseling through her employee \nassistance program. AG \u00b6 26(d) requires a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \n\n \n8 \n \nmedical professional. There is no such prognosis in this case. AG \u00b6 26(d) is not \napplicable. \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21:   \n     \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; and \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent.  \n \nApplicant was arrested in January 2006, and charged with DUI and driving with a \n.08% or higher blood alcohol level. She used illegal stimulants so that she could drink \nalcohol without feeling intoxicated. Her alcohol-related incidents and pattern of alcohol \nconsumption are sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and (c).  \n \nTwo Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and (b) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; and  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser). \n \nApplicant has not had a drink of alcohol in more than two years. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n2(a) and (b) are applicable under the same rationale discussed above under the \nCriminal Conduct and Drug Involvement sections.  \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as \n. . . engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s personal conduct was also alleged under the Criminal Conduct, Drug \nInvolvement, and Alcohol Consumption Drug guidelines, as addressed above. She \ndrove after drinking and used illegal drugs while holding a security clearance. She was \nwell aware that drug use was wrong, illegal, and against DoD policy. She exercised \nextremely poor judgment. This constitutes credible adverse information in other \nadjudicative issue areas that may not be sufficient for an adverse determination under \nany other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, and \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. It is also personal conduct that could \ncreate a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(e) are \napplicable. \nConditions that could mitigate Personal Conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 17. The following are potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n\n \n10 \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and  \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n \n \nThe discussion under the guidelines for Criminal Conduct, Drug Involvement, and \nAlcohol Consumption is equally appropriate for this guideline. Applicant has obtained \ndrug and alcohol counseling and has been drug-free for more than two and a half years \nand alcohol for more than two years. I find that the behavior is unlikely to recur. \nAdditionally, Applicant has been open and honest about the conduct which has reduced \nany potential vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), (d), \nand (e) are applicable. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 30 years old. She used \nmarijuana on a few occasions in high school. She remained drug free in the Army, but \nstarted using illegal drugs after her discharge. She suffered from depression and \nanxiety. She drank alcohol to make her feel relaxed in social settings. She did not like \nthe feeling of being intoxicated and she used methamphetamine and cocaine so that \nshe could consume alcohol without feeling as intoxicated. Most of her drug use was \nwhile holding a security clearance. She had a DUI arrest in January 2006, after which \nher blood alcohol level was tested at .16%. Her extremely poor judgment cannot be \noverstated.  \n \n\n \n11 \n \nApplicant decided a change was necessary in her life. She completely stopped \ntaking illegal drugs in June 2006. She attended outpatient drug and alcohol counseling \nfrom October 2006 through January 2007. She has completely abstained from alcohol \nsince January 2007. She has been under the treatment of a psychiatrist since January \n2007. He prescribed medication and she reported that she no longer had feelings of \ndepression or anxiety.  \n \nSome people take longer to grow up than others. Applicant clearly did not exhibit \nmaturity when she used illegal drugs while holding a security clearance. Since that time \nshe has done everything possible to mitigate her actions. She fully admitted her drug \nuse on her SF 86 and to the background investigator. Her family, friends, and company \nknow of her drug use. She candidly discussed her drug and alcohol use at her hearing \nand credibly testified that she has no intention to use illegal drugs in the future. \nApplicant is the sole wage earner in her family and is well aware that loss of her security \nclearance would adversely affect her employment. I also considered her favorable \ncharacter evidence, employment record, and her deployments to a war zone.  \n \nApplicant is on probation for a few more months. I am convinced that she has \nmatured and that her current record of abiding by the law is a result of her new maturity \nand not simply because she is on probation. She has further convinced me that illegal \ndrug use is a thing of her past. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from her drug and \nalcohol use, criminal conduct, and personal conduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline G:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.c: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 4, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 4.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n12 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

Howry, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Bruce M. Kaufman, Attorney At Law\nDecember 8, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Personnel Security Questionnaire, (SF-86) on August 10,\n1989.  On May 20, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines H and E\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 14, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to another\nAdministrative Judge on August 25, 2008.  The matter was transferred to the\nundersigned Administrative Judge on on October 20, 2008.  A notice of hearing was\nissued on September 15, 2008, scheduling the hearing for October 27, 2008.  The\nGovernment offered seven exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 7,\nwhich were received without objection. Applicant called seven witnesses and offered\neight exhibits, referred to Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through H.  He also testified on his own\nbehalf.  The record remained open until close of business on November 3, 2008 for\nreceipt of additional documentation.  The Applicant submitted one Post-Hearing Exhibit\n\n2\nconsisting of two enclosures.  The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was received on\nNovember 4, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of United States\nCode, Title 21, Sections 802 and 812 which define the Controlled Substance Act.\nApplicant had no objection.  (Tr. p. 24).  The request and the attached documents were\nnot admitted into evidence, but were included in the record. The facts administratively\nnoticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.\nMotion to Amend SOR\nOn August 22, 2008, by written motion, Department Counsel moved to amend\nthe SOR by adding \u00b6 1.c, alleging \u201cYou were arrested on November 26, 1981, in\nNorwalk, CA and charged with (1) Possession of a Controlled Narcotic, and (2)\nPossession of Concentrated Cannabis.

Applicant\u2019s counsel had no objection to the\nmotion.  (Tr. p. 6).  The motion to amend the SOR was granted. \n FINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 49 years old and married.  He is employed by a defense\ncontractor as an Aircraft Electronic Technician, and is applying for a security clearance\nin connection with his employment.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline H - Drug Involvement).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses illegal drugs.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because the Applicant engaged in conduct involving\nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules\nand regulations that raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.\nThe Applicant began using marijuana while he was in the United States Navy\nfrom 1976 until 1980.  He did not hold a security clearance at that time.  On November\n26, 1981, he was arrested and charged with (1) Possession of a Controlled Substance,\nand (2) Possession of Concentrated Cannabis.  At court, the proceedings were\nsuspended pending pre-trial diversion.  He successfully completed the diversion\nprogram and the case was dismissed.       \nIn 1984, the Applicant began working for his current employer.  Since then, he\nhas had different job classifications, some of which required a DoD security clearance,\nothers that have not.  He has held a Top Secret security clearance, without incident for\n\n3\nthe past ten years.  He indicates that he has disclosed his 1981 drug arrest on his\nsecurity clearance applications as required.  \nIn June 2006, while holding a Top Secret DoD security clearance, the Applicant\nattended a wake for a friend who had passed away.  Later that night, a few friends,\nincluding the Applicant, got together to smoke marijuana that the decedent had.  The\nApplicant smoked some marijuana and then went to bed.  That night, he slept in his\ntruck, got up the next day, and drove home.  By then, he no longer felt the effects of the\nmarijuana.  (Tr. p. 97).  Four days later, the Applicant\u2019s employer required him to\nundergo a drug and alcohol screening test due to an industrial accident related to his\nwork.  The test came back positive for marijuana use.  The Applicant admitted that he\nhad smoked marijuana at his friend\u2019s wake but had not smoked it at any other time\nsince then.  He was immediately placed on leave by his company, and required to enroll\nin a Drug Rehabilitation Program.  He attended the program everyday for three weeks.\nAt night he attended Narcotic Anonymous meetings.  He also attended counseling\nsessions with a psychologist, and underwent drug testing weekly.  He completed the\nprogram.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit).  Two months after the incident, he was\npermitted to return to work.  Presently, the Applicant continues to participate in the drug\ntesting program, which is random testing for drugs and alcohol.  The Applicant was\ninformed by his company that if he tests positive again, he will be facing termination.\n(Tr. p. 104). All of his drug tests since the incident have come back negative.      \nA Statement of Intent was submitted by the Applicant that indicates that he will\nnever use any marijuana or any other illegal drug again.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit H and Tr.\nP. 106).  \n  \nThe Applicant indicates that this has been a real lesson, a slap in the face.  He is\nextremely remorseful for his conduct.  This has been the biggest embarrassment for\nhim.  He worries about it every night.  (Tr. p. 111).  \nSeven character witnesses testified on behalf of the Applicant, including his\npresent manager, his past site manager, and other professional colleagues who have\nworked with the Applicant, some of who know him as a friend.  They all attest to his\nreliability and trustworthiness.  He is considered to be extremely ethical and an\noutstanding employee.  (Tr. pp. 26-31, 41-46, 56-61, 65-70, 75-79, 82-86, and 91-112). \n  \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline H (Drug Involvement)\n24. The Concern. Use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\n\n4\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n25. (a) any drug abuse;\n25. (b) testing positive for illegal drug use;\n25. (g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n26. (b).(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for\nany violation.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n16. (c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not\nsufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, but which,\nwhen considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable\njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with\nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not\nproperly safeguard protected information.\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances.\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\n\n5\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges.\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in drug abuse and personal conduct that demonstrates poor\njudgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has  engaged in drug involvement (Guideline H).  The totality of this evidence\nindicates poor judgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant\n(Guideline E).  Because of the scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude\nthere is a nexus or connection with his security clearance eligibility.\n\n6\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guidelines H and E of the SOR.\nI have considered all of the evidence presented in this case, including all of the\nfavorable witness testimony and the accomplishments of the Applicant.  In spite of his\nletter of intent, the coincidence of him testing positive on a drug test after what he says\nis his only use of marijuana is highly improbable and difficult to believe.  The evidence\nshows that the Applicant used marijuana while holding a DoD security clearance.  He\nused marijuana knowing that it was prohibited by law and clearly prohibited by the\nDepartment of Defense.  This demonstrates poor judgment,  untrustworthiness and\nunreliability.  As recently as June 2006, he tested positive for marijuana during a drug\nscreening conducted by his company.  The Applicant is not currently eligible for a\nsecurity clearance.  If he can remain drug free, he may be eligible for a security\nclearance sometime in the future, but not now.  His recent use of marijuana in 2006,\nabsolutely prohibits a favorable determination in this case.     \nUnder Guideline H, Drug Involvement, Disqualifying Conditions, 25(a) any drug\nabuse, 25(b) testing positive for illegal drug use, and 22(g) any illegal drug use after\nbeing granted a security clearance apply.  Mitigating Condition 26(b)(4) a signed\nstatement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation applies.\nDespite this, I find his past use of illegal drugs to be recent and of security significance.\nAccordingly, I find against the Applicant under Guideline H, Drug Involvement. \nUnder Guideline E, Personal Conduct, Disqualifying Conditions,16(c) credible\nadverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an\nadverse determination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as\na \nwhole, \nsupports \na \nwhole-person \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly\nsafeguard protected information applies.  None of the mitigating conditions are\napplicable in this case.  Consequently, I find against the Applicant under Guideline E,\nPersonal Conduct.  \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  The Applicant is 49 years old, a veteran,\nmature,  intelligent, successful, well respected, and a long time employee of the defense\nindustry who has held a security clearance for many years.  Why he used marijuana\nwhile holding a security clearance is bizarre.  Why he used marijuana at all is even\nmore of a mystery.  Under the particular facts of this case, the totality of the conduct set\nforth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a whole person assessment\nof poor judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability, an unwillingness to comply with rules\nand regulations, and/or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly\nsafeguard classified information.  \nThis Applicant has demonstrated that he is not trustworthy, and does meet the\neligibility requirements for access to classified information at this time.  Accordingly, I\nfind against the Applicant under Guidelines H (Drug Involvement) and E (Personal\nConduct).    \n\n7\nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a  security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the SOR.                                                \n  \n  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nParagraph 2: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for\nthe Applicant.                                                                                                                     \nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Marine, Esq., Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On March 7, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations),\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct), and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On\nSeptember 12, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Mary E. Henry granted Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance.  Department Counsel filed a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6\nE3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\n\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable decision under Guidelines E and J is not at issue in this appeal.  \n1\n3\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in her\napplication of the Guideline F mitigating conditions and whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis\nwas erroneous.   Finding error, we reverse the decision of the Judge.\n1\nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Factual Findings\nA.  Facts\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant owns and operates a\ncompany which is a DoD contractor.  He started his business 30 years ago.  In 2005, a real estate\nbroker approached Applicant about purchasing rental property.  After discussing the matter with the\nbroker, Applicant agreed to buy 22 rental properties, consisting \u201cprimarily of single family homes.\u201d\nDecision at 4.  The broker orally promised to sell Applicant the properties at 10% below market\nvalue.  He stated to Applicant that all the properties were rented and that Applicant would not have\nany out-of-pocket expenses.  The broker also promised to make the down payments, pay all closing\ncosts, and cover any shortfall between the loan payments and the rental receipts for a period of one\nyear.  The broker obtained the services of an appraiser and of a mortgage broker, both of whom he\nknew.  He obtained 100% financing for the houses, by means of a primary and secondary mortgage\non each.   \nDuring the settlement process, Applicant learned that the properties were titled in the name\nof the real estate broker\u2019s wife.  At the final closings, the wife refused to sign the agreement through\nwhich the real estate broker would pay the difference between the monthly mortgage and the rent\nreceived on each property.  The real estate broker then refused to sign the agreement himself.\nApplicant lacked the financial resources to pay the difference.\nAfter settlement, Applicant hired an attorney to review the sale.  \u201cThe attorney found serious\nirregularities in the overall transaction,\u201d including that the purchase prices had been inflated; that the\nproperties were not all rented, contrary to representations by the broker; and that the real estate\nbroker had in the past filed for bankruptcy.  The attorney concluded that the broker, his wife, the\nmortgage broker, and the appraiser had employed an elaborate scheme whereby they dumped \u201cpoorly\nperforming properties\u201d on Applicant. Decision at 4.  Applicant was not able to meet the mortgage\nobligations after the final closing.\nSubsequently, Applicant\u2019s attorney wrote to the lenders holding the mortgages on the homes,\nadvising them that the broker had refused to pay his promised share of the mortgage amounts.\nApplicant offered to work out a financial resolution \u201cto mitigate the damages caused [to] the\nmortgage lenders and Applicant by the scheme.\u201d  Decision at 4-5.  Through his attorney, Applicant\noffered to pay the net rents on the properties to the lenders, to rent the vacant properties, to cooperate\nwith selling the properties, and to pursue claims against the broker and the other parties in question.\n\n4\nIn exchange, Applicant requested that the lenders not \u201cnegatively impact\u201d his credit rating.  Decision\nat 5.\nThe lenders chose to foreclose on the properties, all of which had been sold as of the close\nof the record.  \u201cThree law firms advised Applicant that he would not be liable for any unpaid\nmortgage debt following the sale of these properties under the state\u2019s anti-deficiency statutes because\nhis loans were purchase money mortgages . . .  The lenders\u2019 only recourse in this situation is to list\nthe debts on Applicant\u2019s credit report.\u201d  Decision at 5.  \nApplicant\u2019s subsequent credit reports show delinquent debt on two corporate credit cards and\non 18 mortgages, \u201cmany of which are second mortgages on the rental properties.  His other debts are\ntimely paid and 24 mortgages have a zero balance (some of these mortgages are related to his own\nhome.)\u201d  Decision at 5.  Applicant owes a significant amount of money on these two cards.\n\u201cBecause there are problems with fraudulent charges on the larger debt, the negotiations are not\ncomplete.\u201d  Decision at 5-6.  Applicant has filed complaints against the various parties with the State\nBoard of Appraisal, the Department of Real Estate, and the Department of Financial Institutions.\nThese complaints had not been resolved at the close of the record.  He has expressed an intent to sue\nthese parties in court, but lacks the resources to do so. \nB.  Discussion\nThe Appeal Board\u2019s review of the Judge\u2019s findings of facts is limited to determining if they\nare supported by substantial evidence\u2013\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept\nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d\nDirective  \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \u201cThis is something less than the weight of the evidence, and the possibility\nof drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative\nagency\u2019s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime\nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  In evaluating the Judge\u2019s findings, we are required to give\ndeference to the Judge\u2019s credibility determinations.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.\nIn her brief, Department Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s decision is not supported by\nsubstantial record evidence.  The Board will address this concern in the discussion below. \nWhether the Record Supports the Judge\u2019s Ultimate Conclusions\n A Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation\nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d\nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43\n(1983)(quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)).  \u201cThe\ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests\nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  The Appeal\nBoard may reverse the Judge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.  \n\nDirective \u00b6 E2.18.\n2\n5\nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong\npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.  See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913\nF. 2d 1399, 1401 (9  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  After the Government presents\nth\nevidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those\nconcerns.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  \u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and\nwhole person factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them apply to the\nparticular facts of a case.  Rather, their application requires the exercise of sound discretion in light\nof the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03635 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20,\n2006).\nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are arbitrary or capricious, the Board\nwill review the Judge's decision to determine whether:  it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails\nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of\njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the decision\nthat runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed to a mere\ndifference of opinion.  In deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are contrary to law,\nthe Board will consider whether they are contrary to provisions of Executive Order 10865, the\nDirective, or other applicable federal law.  See ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2,\n2006).\nThe security concern under Guideline F is that an applicant\u2019s failure to meet financial\nobligations \u201cmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.\u201d    Given the extent of Applicant\u2019s financial problems, the\n2\nJudge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s case raises Guideline F security concerns is sustainable.  The\nissue to be decided upon appeal is whether the Judge properly concluded that Applicant had met his\nburden of persuasion as to mitigation.\nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge\u2019s decision failed to address significant contrary\nrecord evidence.  This argument is persuasive.  The Judge\u2019s favorable decision relied, to a large\nextent, on her findings that (1) the broker deceived Applicant into purchasing the houses and (2)  the\nstate\u2019s anti-deficiency laws prevent a lender from collecting from a homeowner the difference\nbetween the amount realized at a foreclosure sale and the remaining balance of the home loan.  On\nthe latter point, reliance on the non-collectability of a debt does not constitute a good-faith effort to\nresolve that debt within the meaning of the Directive.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-09966 at 3 (App.\nBd. Jun. 25, 2008).\nMoreover, in this case, the Judge\u2019s decision did not take into account contrary record\nevidence which is less favorable to Applicant.  The Board notes Applicant Exhibit G, a legal\nmemorandum from a law office representing Applicant in his real estate dispute.  The memorandum\n\nGovernment Exhibit 2, Response to Interrogatories, which contains this memorandum as an attachment at p.\n3\n16.\nTr. at 58.\n4\n6\nacknowledged that state law forbade collecting deficiency judgments.  However, it went on to say,\n\u201cthe magnitude of [Applicant\u2019s] indebtedness on these transactions may cause the lenders to seek\nsome other theory on which to recover, such as misrepresentation or a scheme or artifice to defraud,\npossibly alleging that [Applicant] and [the broker] collaborated in a scam designed to pay off the [the\nbroker\u2019s] creditors by duping the present lenders . . . it does not seem likely that the anti-deficiency\nstatutes would prevent the banks from pursuing that type of claim which could result in a personal\njudgment against [Applicant].\u201d  AE G at 4.\nAnother memorandum, by a lawyer working for a different firm, contains similar language.\nWhile acknowledging the general effect of anti-deficiency statutes, the memorandum goes on to say\nthat state case law does not conclusively resolve the question of whether such anti-deficiency statutes\nrelieve a homeowner of debt resulting from fraud.  \u201cClearly the lenders would be remiss if they failed\nto argue that the anti-deficiency statues cannot be used as a shield to prevent recovery of damages\nresulting from fraudulent conduct.\u201d   While neither of these memoranda categorically state that\n3\nApplicant actually engaged in fraudulent conduct, at the very least they undermine the Judge\u2019s\nfinding that Applicant does not owe the banks for the unpaid balance of the mortgages.  However,\neven assuming that Applicant did not knowingly participate in a scheme to defraud (Applicant\npresented no independent corroborating evidence of his claims that the broker defrauded him.), the\nrecord still raises serious questions about his judgment.  He was offered a business proposition\ncontaining promises by the broker that would have prompted a reasonable person to inquire further\nbefore committing to the deal.  This is especially true in light of record evidence of Applicant\u2019s\nextensive business experience.  However, he entered into legally enforceable agreements to purchase\nthese 22 houses without reducing to writing the broker\u2019s promises to pay down-payments, closing\ncosts, and the shortfall between rents and amounts owed on the debts.  Neither is there record\nevidence of efforts by Applicant to verify other representations made to him by the broker as to the\nvalue of the houses, the extent to which they were actually rented, etc.  As an attorney testifying for\nApplicant stated, \u201c[I]f he had done a little more due diligence he wouldn\u2019t have got in this jam.\u201d  \n4\nThe Board has considered the entire record, including the matters which Applicant presented\nin mitigation.  Applicant provided little corroboration for his claims of having been defrauded.\nNeither did he demonstrate reasonable efforts to resolve his delinquent debts, including those\nrelating to his credit cards.  The Judge herself found that he did not provide evidence of a repayment\nplan for the credit card debts.  The record as a whole does not demonstrate that Applicant\u2019s\ndelinquent debts arose from causes outside his control or that he has taken steps to resolve the debts\nsufficient to meet his burden under the Egan standard.  The Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance\ndecision is not sustainable. \n \n\n7\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is REVERSED.  \nSigned: Jean E.

On March 7, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines F, E and\nJ for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 10, 2008 . He answered\nthe SOR in writing on March 12, 2008, and requested a hearing before an\nSeptember 12, 2008\n\nOn June 24, 2008, Applicant shipped additional evidence. The shipper delivered the materials, but for some\n1\nreason returned the documents to Applicant. Applicant resent the documents to Department Counsel on July\n7, 2008. See AE F (Documents verifying shipping issues). Department Counsel compiled the documentation,\nthen reviewed it. The Department Counsel prepared a response, including objections to certain submissions.\nI received all documentation on July 25, 2008.\nAE F, supra note 1; AE G (Opinion memorandum from Attorney, dated May 11, 2006 and Letter dated May\n2\n12, 2006); AE H (1099 forms); AE I through AE N (Letters to various mortgage holders on the rental\nproperties, dated May 22, 2006 and June 9, 2006); AE O (Three complaint letters to State agencies, dated\nNovember 15, 2006); AE P (Letter to credit bureau, dated June 20, 2008); AE Q (Credit report, dated June\n7, 2008); AE R (memo Applicant); AE S (unsigned stipulation); AE T (Letter on utility bill); AE U (Last five\nmonths current credit card statements on a joint account); AE V (Federal and state tax returns for 2005, 2006,\nand 2007).\n2\nadministrative judge. DOHA received the request on March 17, 2008. Department\nCounsel was prepared to proceed on April 17, 2008, and I received the case\nassignment on April 21, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 19, 2008, and I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled on June 3, 2008. The government offered four\nexhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were received and admitted into evidence without\nobjection. Applicant and two witness testified on his behalf. He submitted five exhibits\n(AE) A through E, which were received and admitted into evidence without objection.\nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on June 13, 2008. I held the record\nopen until July 2, 2008, for Applicant to submit additional matters.  Applicant timely\n1\nsubmitted 17 additional documents, which are marked as AE F through V. All are\nadmitted into evidence.  The record closed on July 2, 2008. \n2\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nNotice\nSince the hearing notice was mailed 15 days before the hearing, Applicant did\nnot receive the notice as required under the Directive. I advised Applicant of his right\nunder \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to receive the hearing notice 15 days before the hearing.\nApplicant affirmatively waived his right to the 15 days notice. (Tr. 8.) \nMotion to Amend SOR\nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding \u00b6 1.bb, alleging\nApplicant owes $20,000 to his former attorneys since mid-2007, which has not been\npaid. (Tr. 170.) Applicant objected to the motion, arguing that this creditor has not\nsought payment because of his current financial problems. I granted the government\u2019s\nmotion. (Id.)\nEvidentiary rulings\nThe government objects to the admission of AE S on the grounds it is undated,\nunsigned, and incomplete. Applicant has not responded. The government\u2019s concerns\nare valid. I, however, will admit this document and accord it less weight because of\n\nResponse to SOR, dated March 12, 2008.\n3\nGE 1 (Applicant\u2019s security clearance application, dated November 3, 2006) at 22-23; Tr. 15.\n4\nTr. 15-17.\n5\nGE 4 (Credit report, November 17, 2006); Tr. 17-18.\n6\n3\nthese deficiencies The government also objects to AE U (Referenced by government\ncounsel as APHS Z through EE) on the grounds the document is incomplete because it\nis missing pages. Applicant has not responded to the government\u2019s objections. Again,\nthe government has raised valid concerns. Given that the most important information in\nthis exhibit is page one of each month\u2019s statement, AE U is admitted into evidence.\nLate on September 5, 2008, Applicant faxed a letter to me ex parte. I received\nthe letter on September 9, 2008 and immediately notified Department Counsel. I\ninstructed Department Counsel to respond to the letter no later than Thursday,\nSeptember 11, 2008, which has been done.  Department Counsel objects to the\nadmission of this letter as character evidence because the record closed on July 2,\n2008 and the government has no ability to cross-examine the author of the letter. The\ngovernment does not object to the letter if it is deemed a request to expedite the\ndecision in this case. Given that the record closed on July 2, 2008, I decline to admit the\nletter. Applicant\u2019s request to expedite the decision is moot. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated March 12, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.z and 1.aa of the SOR, and 1.bb of the amended SOR. His answer to\n\u00b6 1.v does not specifically admit the allegation. He neither admitted or denied the\nallegation in \u00b6 1.w, which will be treated as a denial. He denied the remaining factual\nallegations in the SOR.3\nApplicant, who is 62 years old, owns and operates a company which is a\ncontractor to the Department of Defense. He has held a top secret clearance in the\npast.4\nApplicant and his wife married 43 years ago. They have two adult children and\nfive grandchildren. He worked for an engineering firm for five years. He left this\ncompany thirty years ago and started his own business, which provides information\noperations and strategic communications to the Department of Defense.5\nFor many years, Applicant operated his business with credit lines based on his\ncredit rating and work contracts. He had no problem paying his bills.  \n6\nIn 2005, a real estate broker in his office building approached Applicant about\npurchasing rental property. Initially, Applicant declined. After discussing the matter with\n\nAE L, supra note 2, at 1; AE M, supra note 2, at 2; AE N, supra note 2, at 1.\n7\nId.; Tr. 20-21.\n8\nId.\n9\nAE L, supra note 2, at 1; AE M, supra note 2, at 2; AE N, supra note 2, at 1.\n10\n4\nthis individual and based on assurances about financing, Applicant agreed to purchase\n22 rental properties. The rental properties consisted primarily of single family homes.7\nAs part of the agreement between the real estate broker and Applicant, the real\nestate broker agreed to sell the property at 10% below current market value. The real\nestate broker advised that all properties were rented and that Applicant would not have\nany out-of-pocket expenses for the investment. The real estate broker promised to pay\nthe down payments for the new loans, pay all closing costs, and cover any shortfall\nbetween the loan payments and rental receipts on the properties for one year.8\nThe real estate broker obtained an appraisal on each property through an\nappraiser he knew and financing through a mortgage broker known to him. The\nmortgage broker secured 100% financing on each property through a primary mortgage\nand a secondary mortgage. Beginning in February 2006, the sales on these properties\nproceeded to settlement. During this process, Applicant learned that the properties were\ntitled in the name of the real estate broker\u2019s wife. At the final closings, the wife refused\nto sign the agreement that provided for the real estate broker to pay the difference\nbetween the monthly mortgage and the rent received on each property. The real estate\nbroker then declined to sign the agreement. Applicant lacked the financial resources to\npay the difference, a fact known to the real estate broker.9\nSubsequent to the settlement, Applicant\u2019s hired an attorney to review all the\ndocuments related to this sale. The attorney found serious irregularities in the overall\ntransaction, including inflated purchase prices based on false appraisals, prior sales\nlisting on the properties at a much lower market value, properties without renters, failure\nto disclose to the lenders total financing package as required, and the bankruptcy filing\nby the real estate broker. Based on his review, the attorney concluded that the real\nestate broker, along with his wife, the mortgage broker, and appraiser, \u201corchestrated an\nelaborate scheme to relieve himself and/or his wife of poorly performing properties by\nmisleading [Applicant] into buying the properties under false pretenses.\u201d Although the\nrecord does not provide clear evidence on when Applicant defaulted on these\nmortgages, the evidence of record is clear Applicant could not meet his mortgage\nobligations after the final closing.  \n10\nOn May 22, 2006 and June 9, 2006, Applicant\u2019s attorney wrote to the lenders\nholding the mortgage. His attorney advised the mortgage lender that the real estate\nbroker and his wife would not fulfill their promises to pay the mortgage differentials. On\nbehalf of Applicant, the attorney informed each mortgage lender that Applicant desired\nto work out a financial resolution to mitigate the damages caused the mortgage lenders\n\nAE I, supra note 1; AE J - AE N, supra note 2; Tr. 22.\n11\nAE E (Law firm tracking sheet on properties); AE G (Memorandum, dated May 11, 2006); Response to SOR;\n12\nAE H (1099 forms); Tr. 52, 57, 63. Two documents which comprise AE B are included in AE H.\nGE 4, supra note 6.\n13\nGE 3 (Credit report, dated March 4, 2008); AE P (Challenges to credit report); AE Q (Credit report, dated\n14\nJune 7, 2008).\nThe three credit reports of record contain conflicting account numbers and information about these credit\n15\ncard debts. See GE 3, supra note 3; GE 4, supra note 6; AE Q, supra note 2. The account number in GE 4\nand AE Q are the same, thus, these two documents reflect the most accurate information on these debts. The\naccount numbers in GE 3 are completely different from the account numbers in GE 4 and AE Q.\n5\nand Applicant by the scheme. Applicant  offered to pay the net rents on each mortgage\nto the lender, to rent the vacant property, to cooperate with selling the properties, and to\npursue his claims against the real estate broker, his wife, the mortgage broker, and the\nappraiser and share any recovery obtained with the mortgage lenders. In exchange, he\nrequested the lenders not to negatively impact his credit rating.  \n11\nThe lenders chose, instead, to foreclose on all the properties. All the properties\nhave been sold. Three law firms advised Applicant that he would not be liable for any\nunpaid mortgage debt following the sale of these properties under the state\u2019s anti-\ndeficiency statues because his loans were purchase money mortgages. See State\nStatutes 33-701 et seq and 33-801 et seq. Two lenders notified the Internal Revenue\nService (IRS) that Applicant had no personal liability on the mortgage debts. The\nlenders only recourse in this situation is to list the debts on Applicant\u2019s credit report.12\nThe November 17, 2006 credit report reflects that Applicant paid all his bills in a\ntimely manner and had done so for a long period of time. This included at least two\ncredit lines of $500,000 each. The report also shows that Applicant timely paid the\nmortgages on two other rental properties he owned prior to his involvement in the 22\nrental property scheme. The only negative information shown on this report involves the\nmortgage foreclosures on the 22 rental properties.13\nHis March 2008 credit report reflects a major change in his financial situation\nrelated to the mortgages on the rental property and two credit cards. His June 7, 2008\ncredit report shows a balance due on two corporate credit cards, and 18 mortgages,\nmany of which are second mortgages on the rental properties. His other debts are\ntimely paid and 24 mortgages have a zero balance (some of these mortgages are\nrelated to his own home). On June 20, 2008, he filed a challenge to all the debts listed\non his credit report related to the mortgages and unpaid corporate credit cards.\nApplicant pays one personal credit card on a monthly basis and has reduced his debt\non this card significantly.14\nApplicant owes a significant amount of money on two credit cards he used in\nbusiness.   For both cards, he has started negotiations to resolve this debt. Because\n15\n\nAE D (Undated letter); AE S (Draft stipulation); Tr. 42, 60-61.\n16\nAE O (Complaint letters); Tr. 60-71, 143, 151.\n17\nGE 2, (Interrogatories and answers) at 7; AE V (Tax returns); Tr. 35-35, 64-65, 125-127, 142. \n18\nTr. 57, 62-64, 96-99.\n19\n6\nthere are problems with fraudulent charges on the larger debt, the negotiations are not\ncomplete. He has not provided evidence which shows that he has either paid the debts\nor started a monthly payment plan. He provided a stipulation that indicates his\nnegotiation efforts on his largest credit card debt, but since the stipulation is not signed,\nit is insufficient to show he has resolved this debt. He has developed a payment plan for\nthe unpaid utility bill. He also owes a law firm $20,000. The law firm considers him a\ngood credit risk and is working with him on the debt.   \n16\nIn November 2006, Applicant and his wife filed complaints with the State Board\nof Appraisal, Department of Real Estate, and Department of Financial Institutions\nalleging misconduct and fraud against the appraiser, real estate broker and his\ncompany, and the mortgage broker and his company. The complaints are still active\nwith the state agencies. Although Applicant indicated he would pursue legal action\nagainst the individuals and their companies involved in the fraud, he lacks the financial\nresources to proceed with legal action. .\n17\nApplicant earns a good income from his business. In 2006, his gross monthly\nincome totaled $25,000, his net monthly income totaled $18,750 and his expenses\ntotaled $16,300. His company paid $3,500 of his expenses. His current monthly income\nis between $13,000 and $15,000 depending upon his business. His monthly expenses\nremain the same. As President of his company, he takes no salary until he pays his\nemployees. Because of his current financial issues, his salary varies each month. He\ncontinues to pay his personal expenses. He no longer operates his business on a line of\ncredit as the banks have withdrawn the lines of credit.18\nApplicant discussed his liability for the mortgage loan debts with his attorneys.\nEach told him he had no liability for any deficiency balances on the mortgages after\nforeclosure. Applicant did not specifically ask his attorneys how he should answer\nquestions on his security clearance application (e-QIP). He asked a more general\nquestion about what he should say if the issue comes up. When he completed his e-QIP\non November 3, 2006, he answered \u201cno\u201d to question 28 about financial delinquencies\nbecause he understood from counsel that he did not owe this money. He knew that the\nrental properties had been foreclosed at the time he answered this question.19\n  \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\n\n7\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2\u00a9,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \n\n8\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt when the banks\nforeclosed on mortgage loans for rental properties he innocently acquired in a fraud\nscheme. He has been unable to repay the balance on the mortgage loans and credit\ncard debts for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially\ndisqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial worries arose because of a fraudulent real estate scheme. There is little\nlikelihood he will venture into this type of real estate investment in the future. I find the\nreal estate investment in rental properties occurred under such unusual circumstances\nthat it is unlikely to recur, and it does not raise concerns about his current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. This mitigating condition fully applies to the\nmortgage debts.\nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above,\nApplicant\u2019s financial problems arose from a fraudulent real estate scheme. When he\nrealized he had problems with his investment, he immediately hired legal counsel.\nThrough his attorney, he sought to invalidate the investment deal and tried to work out a\nresolution with the mortgagors. He also filed complaints against the perpetrators of the\nfraud. These actions indicate he acted reasonably under the circumstances. This\nmitigating condition is applicable to his rental properties and the mortgages for those\nproperties. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not received financially counseling, thus, this\npart of mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(c) is not applicable. Applicant, however, made a\n\n9\ngood faith effort in 2006 to resolve the mortgage issues when he asked his attorneys to\nmake an offer on his behalf to work out the mortgage payment problems. The banks\nrefused to work with him, a factor he cannot control. There are also clear indications\nthat his mortgage debt problem is resolved or under control. He is trying to negotiate a\npayment plan on his two remaining business credit card debts. While this debt is large,\nin comparison to the total debts raised in the SOR, this unpaid debt is 10 % of the debts\nalleged and Applicant has the financial resources to resolve the debts upon completion\nof the negotiations. I conclude these potentially mitigating conditions have some\napplicability.\nFinally, AG \u00b6 20 (e) \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the\nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of\nactions to resolve the issue\u201d applies. Applicant challenged the listing of the unpaid\nmortgage debts on his credit report. Given his attorneys advise that he does not owe\nthese debts under state law, he has a legitimate basis to challenge the debts. This\nmitigating condition applies to the mortgage debts listed on his credit report.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct::\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16(a) describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nThe government established that Applicant omitted material facts from his SF-86\nwhen he answered \u201cno\u201d to Question 28 a and b about his financial delinquencies. This\ninformation is material to the evaluation of Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness to hold a security\nclearance and to his honesty. For this guideline to apply, Applicant\u2019s omission must be\ndeliberate. He denies, however, that he deliberately falsified his answer to these\nquestions. When a falsification allegation is controverted, the government has the\nburden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove\nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative\njudge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133\n20\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\n10\ndirect or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the\ntime the omission occurred.  For DC \u00b6 16 (a) to apply, the government must establish\n20\nthat Applicant\u2019s omission, concealment or falsification in his answer was deliberate.\nAt the time he completed his SF-86, Applicant knew the rental properties he\npurchased earlier in 2006 had gone to foreclosure. Because he knew this information\nwould be relevant to his security clearance, he asked his attorneys about his liability on\nthese loans. His attorneys advised him that he did not owe any money on these\nmortgage debts and had no personal liability on these debts. Thus, when he answered\nQuestion 28 a and b, he did not believe he was delinquent in any debts related to the\nmortgages on the foreclosed property. Based on the advice he received from his\nattorneys, he was firmly convinced he had a valid defense to the debt payment and\nowed no money as a result of the foreclosure. His other debts were all current when he\ncompleted his e-QIP. The government has not established that Applicant intentionally\nfalsified his e-QIP. Guideline E is found in favor of Applicant.\nGuideline  J, Personal Conduct\nSince I found that Applicant did not intentionally falsify his e-QIP, I find in favor of\nApplicant on this Guideline.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Thirty years ago, Applicant started\n\n11\nhis own communications business. Since that time, he built and successfully operated\nhis communications company. As his business grew, he hired staff, including financial\npersons. When necessary, he retained legal counsel to handle his business affairs. As\nhis business grew, he managed the daily cash flow through line of credit from banks. He\nalways paid his bills on time. He had an excellent credit rating.\nIn 2005, a real estate broker in his office building raised the possibility of\ninvesting in the real estate market. Although he initially declined, Applicant eventually\nagreed to buy 22 rental properties. He negotiated terms of the purchase with the real\nestate broker, but did not reduce the negotiations to writing as he trusted the real estate\nbroker. Because he trusted the real estate broker, he did not carefully investigate the\nproperties involved in this deal. The real estate broker obtained the mortgage financing\nand the property appraisals through his friends. Until the closing on the properties,\nApplicant did not know that the property he purchased had been titled in the name of\nthe wife of the real estate broker. When the final closing occurred, the real estate broker\nand his wife reneged on a major part of the financing for the properties.\nApplicant sought legal counsel on the financing issues with the property. His\nattorneys uncovered a well-orchestrated scheme to unload poorly performing rental\nproperty at inflated real estate values. Due diligence would have uncovered the\nunrented properties, but not the problems with the appraisal values and improper\nmortgage financing. Applicant, however, bears some responsibility for not investigating\nthe real estate arrangement more aggressively. The perpetrators of this fraudulent\nscheme absconded with the profits from the sale of properties with inflated appraisals\nand left Applicant with excessive mortgage debt on the low value properties. This\nfraudulent scheme seriously impacted Applicant\u2019s  business and personal finances. The\nbanks withdrew the lines of credit he used to operated his business, forcing him to work\nstrictly on a cash flow basis. His personal income from the business also declined\nsharply since he changed how his business operates. He has paid his personal debts in\na timely manner.\nUnder state law, the mortgage lenders cannot seek reimbursement of any\nfinancial losses from the foreclosure procedures instituted when Applicant defaulted on\nthe loan payments. He owes nothing on the these loans, which comprise 90% of the\ndebts listed in the SOR. Except for his unintentional involvement in this fraudulent\nscheme, Applicant always maintained excellent finances. He always paid his bills on\ntime. He is a successful businessman who has provided needed services to the\ngovernment. In the field of communications, his speciality, he has developed business\nand professional expertise. He ventured into the real estate investment market with little\nreal estate knowledge and experience. He failed in his real estate enterprise. There is\nlittle likelihood he will venture into other areas of investment without learning as much\nas he can about the market. Applicant has learned a hard lesson about investment\nventures.\n Applicant relied on his attorneys\u2019 representations about his personal liability for\nthe unpaid mortgage debt. In doing so, he answered the financial questions on the\nsecurity based on his explanation for the foreclosures. Applicant is working to resolve\n\n12\nthe remaining credit card debts, which are business credit cards. His company normally\npays these bills  His attorney does not consider him a credit risk and is not demanding\nimmediate repayment of his $20,000 in attorney fees. His business income is sufficient\nto pay these debts and there is little likelihood he will not pay these debts, given his past\npayment records. These debts, as well as his attorney fee debt, cannot be a source of\nimproper pressure or duress. Of course, the issue is not simply whether all his debts are\npaidBit is whether his financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a\nsecurity clearance. While some debts remain unpaid, they are insufficient to raise\nsecurity concerns. (See AG & 2(a)(1).)  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.bb:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the SOR allegations, except for SOR 1.c and 2.a. He is a 48- year-old senior principal engineer employed by a defense contractor since June 2007. He seeks to retain the security clearance he has held since April 2003, which was suspended in 2007 as a result of the behavior recorded below. He reported his mental health consultations and the adverse clearance actions by other government agencies on his clearance applications in May 2003 (GE 3), January 2007 (GE 2), and June 2007 (GE 1). He had no security lapses while his clearance was active. In June 2005, another government agency denied Applicant\u2019s request for special access because of the issues raised in SOR 2.b, as well as for conduct cited under the criminal conduct and psychological conditions guidelines that are not alleged in the SOR (GE 12). The decision was largely based on a May 2005 evaluation by the agency\u2019s 3 psychological services department\u2014not contained in the record\u2014that diagnosed Applicant with Paraphilia Not Otherwise Specified\u2013Telephone Scatologia (SOR 1.d).

Edmunds, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nBased on the record in this case,  Applicant\u2019s clearance is granted.\n1\nOn 9 July 2009 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines\nD, Sexual Behavior and E, Personal Conduct.  Applicant timely answered the SOR, and\n2\nrequested a hearing. DOHA assigned the case to me 4 September 2009, and I\nconvened a hearing 7 October 2009. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 14 October\n2009.\nOctober 27, 2010\n\nThe other agency acted under regulations that use adjudicative guidelines that are virtually identical to the\n3\nguidelines applicable here.\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations, except for SOR 1.c and 2.a. He is a 48-\nyear-old senior principal engineer employed by a defense contractor since June 2007.\nHe seeks to retain the security clearance he has held since April 2003, which was\nsuspended in 2007 as a result of the behavior recorded below. He reported his mental\nhealth consultations and the adverse clearance actions by other government agencies\non his clearance applications in May 2003 (GE 3), January 2007 (GE 2), and June 2007\n(GE 1). He had no security lapses while his clearance was active.\nIn June 2005, another government agency denied Applicant\u2019s request for special\naccess because of the issues raised in SOR 2.b, as well as for conduct cited under the\ncriminal conduct and psychological conditions guidelines that are not alleged in the SOR\n(GE 12).  The decision was largely based on a May 2005 evaluation by the agency\u2019s\n3\npsychological services department\u2014not contained in the record\u2014that diagnosed\nApplicant with Paraphilia Not Otherwise Specified\u2013Telephone Scatologia (SOR 1.d).\nApplicant appealed the decision in October 2005 (GE 5), and the clinical psychologist\nwho conducted the May 2005 evaluation was given the opportunity to rebut his appeal\nand reaffirm her original diagnosis in November 2005 (GE 6). In reaffirming her\ndiagnosis, she pointed out that her role as a forensic psychologist differed from the roles\nof treating psychologists or psychiatrists. In November 2005, Applicant\u2019s appeal was\ndenied (GE 7). He exercised his further right to appeal in December 2005 (GE 8), but\nthe results of that appeal are not in the record. In July 1995, a different government\nagency also denied Applicant\u2019s request for special access for psychological reasons\n(GE 14).\nIn 1983 or 1984, Applicant was charged with making obscene telephone calls.\nThe charges were later dropped (SOR 1.a). In 1988, he was charged again with making\nobscene telephone calls, and the charges were dropped when he agreed to attend\ncounseling (SOR 1.b). In summer 2001, a deaf woman Applicant was dating obtained a\nrestraining order against him for sending sexually-explicit text messages (SOR 1.c).\nSince the late 1980s, Applicant has had counseling, therapy, and medication for\nmental health issues including depression, anxiety, and the sexually-inappropriate\nconduct noted above. The medical records from those providers (GE 9-11) were\napparently available to the agency psychologist, as was the record of Applicant\u2019s\ninterview with a government investigator in September 2004 (GE 13). Both his\npsychologist (GE 11) and his psychiatrist (GE 10) at the time considered him eligible for\na clearance. His psychiatrist in particular noted that he responded well to treatment.\nBoth gave him favorable prognoses. Applicant\u2019s current psychiatrist\u2014who has been\ntreating him since July 2007\u2014gives him an excellent prognosis. She notes that he is\nsymptom free on his medication, totally compliant with treatment, and shows good\njudgment (AE A). She has no concerns with him holding a clearance.\n\n3\nIn August and September 2009, Applicant underwent a complete forensic\npsychological evaluation to determine his current intellectual and personality functioning\n(AE I). The clinical psychologist gave Applicant 20 tests, and appears to have reviewed\nthe Government\u2019s records submitted as evidence in this case. His evaluation contains a\ndetailed analysis of those records as well as the test results. Although he recommended\nApplicant continue his medications and therapy, he concluded that Applicant should\nhave his clearance reinstated:\nIt is recommended, with a reasonable degree of medical\ncertainty, that [Applicant] should be reconsidered and\nreinstated with his security clearance. There is no evidence,\nin the current test protocol, of pathological behavior that\nwould preclude his reinstatement. It would appear that\n[Applicant] has experienced considerable personal growth\nsince the incidents in 1985 and 1990. Further, the incident in\n2001 was a result of a dysfunctional and ego-dystonic\nrelationship. The probability that he would repeat such an\ninteraction approaches zero.\nApplicant has a good work record and has received several awards and\ncertificates of achievement (AE H). His character witnesses and references (AE C-G)\nconsider him honest and trustworthy. Both his witnesses are aware that Applicant is in\ntherapy.\nPolicies\nThe adjudicative guidelines (AG) list factors to evaluate a person\u2019s suitability for\naccess to classified information. Administrative judges must assess disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions under each issue fairly raised by the facts and situation presented.\nEach decision must also show a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration of the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). The applicability of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is\nnot, by itself, conclusive. However, specific guidelines should be followed when a case\ncan be measured against them, as they are policy guidance governing the grant or\ndenial of a clearance. Considering the SOR allegations and the evidence as a whole,\nthe relevant adjudicative guidelines are Guidelines D (Sexual Behavior) and E (Personal\nConduct).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government\nmust prove, by substantial evidence, disputed facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, the\nburden shifts to applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a right to a security clearance, the applicant bears a heavy burden\nof persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the Government has a\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n4\n\u00b6 13.(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted;\n5\n\u00b6 13.( b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk sexual behavior that the person is unable to\n6\nstop or that may be symptomatic of a personality disorder;\n\u00b6 13.(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress;\n7\n\u00b6 13.(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that which reflects lack of discretion or judgment.\n8\n\u00b6 14.(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such unusual circumstances,\n9\nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n\u00b6 14.(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or duress.\n10\n\u00b6 14.(d) the behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet.\n11\n4\ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the required judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels deciding any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government.4\nAnalysis\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline D, but,\nApplicant mitigated the security concerns. Although the record evidence suggests that\nsome aspects of his behavior may have been consensual, particularly with regard to the\ntext messages, the only applicable disqualifying condition relates to criminal sexual\nbehavior.  However, his misconduct was not compulsive,  is sufficiently known so does\n5\n6\nnot potentially subject him to duress.  and did not involve public behavior.  While there\n7\n8\nare factual discrepancies between details of the sexual behavior reported by Applicant\nand those recorded by various interviewers and medical professionals, those variances\nare insignificant in the context of this decision because the medical assessments are\nlargely based on the most serious version of events and because the last recorded\nincident of sexual behavior was in 2001.\nConversely, two mitigating conditions are applicable to Applicant\u2019s conduct. The\nconduct was infrequent and not recent, although at the time not under particularly\nunusual circumstances.  Further, Applicant has received counseling, therapy, and\n9\nmedication, and continues in treatment with his psychiatrist and is completely compliant\nwith her treatment recommendations. There have been no further incidents since 2001.\nThe fact that the conduct is sufficiently known among personal and professional\nconnections limits the potential for duress.  Finally, it appears that in each instance, the\n10\nbehavior may have begun as consensual behavior before Applicant overstepped the\nboundaries.  I resolve Guideline D for Applicant.\n11\n\n\u00b6 16.(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse\n12\ndetermination under any other single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness\nto comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly\nsafeguard protected information; (d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other\nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all\navailable information supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics\nindicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected information. . . ; (e) personal conduct, or\nconcealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or\nduress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or\ncommunity standing . . .;\n\u00b6 17.(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened\n13\nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n5\nThe Government established a case for disqualification under Guideline E\nbecause of Applicant\u2019s poor judgment in the sexual behavior admitted by Applicant and\ndocumented by the Government\u2019s evidence.  However, Applicant mitigated the security\n12\nconcerns raised by his conduct. This incident is sufficiently known in his personal and\nprofessional circles, alleviating the potential vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or\nduress. Further, without minimizing the seriousness or distastefulness of the conduct,\nthe judicial system resolved it as relatively minor incidents. The incidents occurred over\nnine years ago, and are unlikely to recur.  Given the favorable prognoses of both his\n13\ncurrent psychiatrist, and the evaluating psychologist, I find that Applicant\u2019s\ncircumstances warrant continuation of his clearance. I resolve Guideline E for Applicant.\nI have particularly considered the fact that Applicant obtained his September\n2009 psychological evaluation (AE I) specifically to address the allegations in the SOR.\nHowever, I give it persuasive weight for a variety of reasons. The evaluator\u2019s extensive\nresume and the thoroughness of not only the testing and records review, but the\nthoroughness of his explanations of how those results influenced his conclusions, leads\nme to believe the conclusions stated are reliable. Those conclusions are consistent with\nApplicant\u2019s current treating physician (AE A) and his earlier providers (GE 10, 11).\nFinally, without disparaging the conclusions of the agency psychologist in May and\nNovember 2005 (GE 6)\u2014when the behavior was much more recent and the treatment\nperhaps neither as long nor as thorough as it is now\u2014I note that her conclusions in\nNovember 2005 appear to be a rebuttal of the stinging rebuke submitted by Applicant\u2019s\nthen-counsel in his October 2005 appeal (GE 5) not an impartial forensic examination.\nFurther, her November 2005 responses include a significant amount of speculation\nabout facts not contained in the record. In addition, the clinical psychologist who did\nApplicant\u2019s September 2009 evaluation specifically criticized her evaluation for not\nconducting the kind of tests designed to facilitate the diagnosis she was making.\nIt would be easy to translate visceral distaste for Applicant\u2019s conduct into denial\nor revocation of his clearance. Such a reaction would be equivalent to a per se denial\nunder the circumstances of this case. However, security clearance determinations are\n\n6\nnot designed to reward or punish applicants for past conduct that raises security\nconcerns. They are designed to be a clear-eyed assessment of the current risk that a\ngiven applicant might deliberately or inadvertently disclose protected information to\nindividuals not entitled to it. Given the judicial resolution of these incidents, the favorable\npsychiatric prognoses, and Applicant\u2019s past record of access to protected information\nwithout incident, his adverse conduct presents little likelihood that he would waver from\nthat record.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

The\ncase was assigned to another judge on July 22, 2008, and reassigned to me on\nSeptember 5, 2008.  It was scheduled for hearing on October 7, 2008.  A hearing was\nheld on October 7, 2008, for the purpose of considering whether it would be clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant, continue, or deny, Applicant\u2019s application\nfor a security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's case consisted of seven\nexhibits; Applicant relied on four witnesses (including himself) and two exhibits.  The\nNovember 28, 2008\n\n2\ntranscript (R.T.) was received on October 15, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case\nfile, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied. \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guidelines J and D, Applicant is alleged to have  been convicted of\nannoying or molesting a child under 18 years of age (a misdemeanor), for which he was\nplaced on summary probation until June 2010 and ordered to register as a sex offender.\n For his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations covered\nby Guideline J with explanations.  He explained that he could have used a better choice\nof words when communicating with the minor, but his words were not intended to be\ntaken in a sexual or inappropriate manner.  He claimed he was convicted of a single\nmisdemeanor charge of annoying a minor (not a molesting charge).  He claimed he has\nbeen fully compliant with his summary probation (the lowest form of probation) and\ncomplied with the court\u2019s wishes in registering as a sex offender.  He claimed that he\nwill move to dismiss his conviction when his probation is completed in June 2010, which\nif successful will eliminate his need to register as a sex offender.\nResponding to the Guideline D allegations, Applicant denied any sexual\ndysfunction or compulsion associated with his actions.  He explained that the whole\nsituation from his point of view stemmed from an unfortunate misunderstanding.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 35-year-old-security guard  for a defense contractor who seeks a\nsecurity clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant\nare incorporated herein and adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional\nfindings follow.\nApplicant is unmarried and has no children.  He has a step-sister (age 15) and a\nfianc\u00e9 who has resided with him since 2005 (see ex. 1; R.T., at 38-39).  His step-sister\n(X) resides with his father who he has not seen in over a year (R.T., at 39).  He has\nearned college credits at a local college (R.T., at 37).\nApplicant\u2019s step-sister (X), 13 years of age at the time, introduced him to her\nfriend (Y) in 2005 (see ex. 2; R.T., at 40-41).  From the time they met in 2005 to at least\nAugust 2006, Applicant maintained social contact with Y through family gatherings.  In\nAugust 2006, they began e-mailing each other on a regular basis (R.T., at 41-42).  Over\na two-month period between August and October 2006, Applicant and Y exchanged e-\nmail communications with each other weekly.  Sometimes X would participate in their e-\nmail exchanges (R.T., at 53-54).  The content of their discussions is not clear.  Applicant\nclaims they discussed daily events in their lives, but nothing of a sexual nature (see ex.\n2; R.T., at 51).  Y provided no account of their exchanges that can be gauged in this\n\n1\n      In his hearing testimony, he varied his account somewhat of how he responded to Y\u2019s e-mail.  At hearing,\nhe said he suggested to Y in his e-mail that the dress \u201cshould look good across her backside and that it should\nshow off her legs if she was going to wear that kind of a dress\u201d (R.T., at 42).\n3\nrecord.  But Y did testify about her experiences with Applicant, and the depth and scope\nof their e-mail communications (R.T., at 55).  Whether any sexually suggestive words\nwere exchanged by either e-mail participant is unclear. \nIn October 2006, Y e-mailed Applicant about a costume she was going to wear\nfor Halloween.  In her e-mail she stated that she was going to dress up a gangster and\nwear a flapper dress (see ex. 2; R.T., at 42).  Applicant responded to her e-mail.  In his\ne-mail response, he stated that Y should show off her legs and make sure that she\nshows off her backside to make it look good (ex. 2).   He indicated that he wished he\n1\ncould be there to see her (R.T., at ).  Y brought a copy of the e-mail exchange to school\nto show a friend.\nUnder circumstances unclear in the record, Y\u2019s teacher gained access to\nApplicant\u2019s October 2006 e-mail to Y.  Upon seeing the e-mail (considering it\ninappropriate), she promptly turned it over to the campus police officer.  This campus\npolice officer, in turn, contacted Y\u2019s mother.  Records indicate that the mother wanted\nthe police officer to personally investigate Applicant\u2019s contact with Y.  The officer talked\nto both Y and Applicant about their e-mail exchange and reportedly told Applicant not to\nworry (see ex. 2).\nY\u2019s mother, unaware of Applicant\u2019s e-mail exchanges with her daughter filed\ncharges with the local district attorneys\u2019 office (R.T. at 55-56).  In November 2006,\nApplicant received a summons from the local justice center, notifying him that he was\ncharged with annoying a minor/molesting a minor in violation of \u00a7647.6(a) of the C\nPenal Code (a misdemeanor).  In December 2006, Applicant appeared in court on the\ncharge and pleaded not-guilty.  He was assigned a public defender, who was eventually\ntransferred.  Applicant was then assigned a new public defender.  His case was placed\non the trial calendar, and had to be continued several times due to repeated requests\nfrom both sides. \n In June 2007, Applicant\u2019s case was heard by a jury.  The case lasted roughly\ntwo days and included testimony from Y (R.T., at 45, 55) Y\u2019s mother did not testify\naccording to Applicant (R.T, at 55), and it is not clear whether Applicant testified or\nproduced the series e-mails transmitted between Y and himself.  After the parties\nsubmitted their respective cases, the jury retired and later returned a guilty verdict on\nthe \u00a7647.6(a) annoying a minor/molesting a minor charge (see exs. 2, 5 and 6).  \nFollowing the jury\u2019s return of its guilty verdict, the court remanded Applicant to a\nlocal jail for holding pending sentencing.  Four days later, Applicant appeared before the\ntrial judge for sentencing.  The court committed Applicant to summary probation for a\nperiod of 36 months, subject to imposed conditions (see ex. 6; R.T., at 35). The court\nfined Applicant $200.00 plus court costs and a restitution fee.  Records confirm that\n\n4\nApplicant satisfied these financial requirements.  Besides fining him, the court\nsentenced him to 120 days of confinement (to be served on consecutive weekends\nbeginning in August 2007 (ex. 6).  The court also ordered Applicant to participate in\ngroup counseling and register with local law enforcement as a sex offender, provide a\nDNA sample as directed by the local probation department, and have no contact with Y\n(ex. 6; R.T., at 35).  \nRecords confirm that Applicant satisfied the court\u2019s financial requirements of his\nprobation and committed to an outpatient counseling program.  His family counseling\nrecords confirm that he entered their counseling program in July 2007.  Minutes of the\ncourt\u2019s records confirm that the court found Applicant in compliance with court ordered\nterms of probation and need not appear any further (see ex. 5).\nMore recently, Applicant\u2019s licensed counselor (XM) noted that Applicant has not\nexhibited any pattern of self-destructive or high-risk sexual behavior that he could not\ncurtail.  In his evaluation of Applicant, XM found no indication of a personality disorder\nor identified other occurrences or mental conditions.  XM credited Applicant with\npresenting in group as a person of otherwise appropriate judgment and expressing\nauthentic remorse for the hurt and anxiety his behavior caused Y and her family (see\nex. 5).  XM described the outcome of Applicant\u2019s treatment as very successful.  He\nreaffirmed his remorse for the emotional stress he caused Y and her family (ex. 5; R.T.,\nat 35-36, 62).\nSince his June 2007 conviction, Applicant has stayed away from Y.  To avoid\neven the chance of running into Y who still sees his step-sister, he does not visit his\nfather any more (R.T., at 56-58).  When his probation is completed in 2010, he hopes to\nfile a motion to dismiss the charges and remove his name from sex offender registration\n(R.T., at 35).\nApplicant continues to insist on the innocent nature of his e-mail exchanges with\nY, acknowledging only that he used poor judgment in choosing the words he used in his\nOctober 2006 e-mail exchange (R.T., at 62).  Applicant; though, provides no material\ncorroboration for his assurances.  When asked about the whereabouts of the months of\ne-mails he insists were innocent, he explained he used a neopets account (status\nunknown), and deleted the e-mails themselves (R.T., at 59-60).  Presumably, the jury\nbelieved Y\u2019s account of the key e-mail and all of the circumstances surrounding the e-\nmail she was able to recount. \nApplicant is praised by his fianc\u00e9 and her family as a stable and considerate\nperson.  He impresses his fianc\u00e9, her sister and mother with his trustworthiness and the\nabsence of any indicated inappropriate behavior around children (see ex. B; R.T., at 65-\n66, 73-74, 84-85).  His fiance (D) acknowledged her general awareness of his contacts\nwith Y, but had not seen the specific contents of Applicant\u2019s October 2006 e-mail\nexchange with Y (R.T., at ).  D\u2019s  mother (E) is equally supportive of Applicant\u2019s\ntrustworthiness.  A retired school teacher, E credits Applicant with being good to her\n\n5\ndaughter (ex. B; R.T., at 84-85).  Likewise, D\u2019s sister (F) describes Applicant as a good\nand honest person (R.T., at 73-74).\nAbsent performance evaluations and furnished impressions from Applicant\u2019s\nemployer, it remains unclear what impact (if any) his conviction has had on his\nemployment relationship.  The only furnished accounts from his employer entail a\nsummary of Applicant\u2019s conviction and sentence forwarded to DoD by his employer\u2019s\nfacility clearance officer (see ex. 7).  Without more input from his employer, it is unclear\nwhether any of his superiors and colleagues are aware of the facts and circumstances\nsurrounding his 2007 conviction.  \n \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\"\nif any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nCriminal Conduct\nThe Concern: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into\nquestion a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and\nregulations.  See Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), \u00b6 18.\nSexual Behavior\nThe Concern. Sexual behavior that involves a criminal offense,\nindicates a personality or emotional disorder, may subject the individual to\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or\nwhich may subject the individual to undue influence or coercion,\nexploitation, or duress can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  No adverse\ninference concerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely\non the basis of the sexual orientation of the individual.  See Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG),  \u00b6 18.\n\n6\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon a\nthreshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because\nthe Directive requires Administrative Judges to make a common sense appraisal of the\nevidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility\nfor a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\nJudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a security guard for a defense contractor who pleaded guilty to a\nmisdemeanor charge of annoying or molesting a child under 18 years of age in 2007.\nApplicant was placed on three years of summary probation (to June 2010) by the court.\nProbation conditions include a fine, restitution, counseling, 120 days of electronic\nmonitoring and registration with state authorities as a sex offender.  While Applicant\u2019s\nfamily and close friends are aware of the incident and ensuing conviction, questions still\npersist over the extent of knowledge of the conviction and surrounding circumstances by\nApplicant\u2019s coworkers and supervisors. \nApplicant\u2019s actions raise security concerns under both the criminal conduct and\nsexual behavior guidelines.  DC \u00b6 31(a) of Guideline J, \u201ca single serious crime or multiple\nlesser offenses,\u201d is applicable to Applicant\u2019s situation.  Equally applicable is DC \u00b6 31(d),\n\u201cindividual is currently on parole or probation.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s conduct is also covered by\nGuideline D and can be resolved under that Guideline as well.\nJudgment and potential blackmail concerns still exist over Applicant\u2019s e-mail\nrelationship with a minor and conviction in 2007 based on an e-mail found to violate the\nstatutory protections provided \u00a7647.6 of the C Penal Code. These actions reflect both\n\n7\nserious judgment lapses and actions that could possibly expose him to risks of potential\nblackmail.  Applicant\u2019s actions are expressly covered by Guideline D, and are entitled to\nindependent cognizance under this Guideline according to the Appeal Board.  See ISCR\nCase No. 06-20964, at 6 (April 10, 2008).  Where (as here) there is additional probative\nadverse information covered by Guideline D that is not covered by Guideline J, and\nwhich reflects a recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility or emotionally\nunstable behavior (i.e., Applicant\u2019s established relationship with C which he pursued\nthrough e-mail exchanges with C (including the identified actionable one) for about two\nmonths before ceasing contacts with C pursuant to court order).  Independent grounds\ndo exist for considering questionable judgment and trustworthiness and exploitation and\ncoercion risk allegations under Guideline D, quite apart from the criminal implications of\nhis actions.  Authority for considering overlapping conduct under both guidelines is\ncontained in the guidance provided in Enclosure 2, \u00b6 2(d) of the Directive\u2019s August 2006\namendments. \n So, under Guideline D, core judgment and exploitation concerns covered by D.C.\n\u00b6 13(a), \u201csexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been\nprosecuted,\u201d DC \u00b6 13(c), \u201csexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress,\u201d and DC \u00b6 13(d), \u201csexual behavior of a public nature\nand/or that reflects lack of discretion or judgment.\u201d  \nTo be sure, Applicant is of record in making his exchanges with Y known to his\nfiance, her mother, and her sister.  While this reduces his vulnerability risk to coercion\nand pressure, it does not resolve concerns about his judgment and trustworthiness.  His\nkey 2006 e-mail response reflects not only poor judgment but insensitivity to the\nemotional fragility of a minor (just 13 at the time). \n While Applicant  may not be at high risk to recurrence at this time, he still remains\nunder the court\u2019s imposed summary probation.  His probation is not due to expire until\nJune 2010.  So, at least for the duration of his probation, he must remain registered as a\nsex offender.  Applicant\u2019s probation and registration status represent the considered\nassessments of his jury and presiding jurist, and remain a prudent bench guide for\ngauging any recurrence risks.\nThe recurrent judgment lapses that inhere in Applicant\u2019s 2006 annoying/molesting\nconviction, his continued probation and registration status and the uncertainty\nsurrounding his employer disclosures to date, preclude safe predictive judgments at this\ntime that he will not engage in any similar activity in the foreseeable future.  Neither the\ntiming of his actions, the accompanying circumstances, the recurrence risks, nor the still\npotential for blackmail warrant the application of any of the mitigating conditions in\nGuideline J or Guideline D.  \nSo recurrent and recent are his encounters with Y (no matter how innocent some\nof them might be) that the likelihood of their occurring again cannot be safely discounted.\nWhether any of the unidentified e-mails Applicant exchanged with Y could have made a\ndifference can not be not be gauged without seeing the e-mails. And for whatever\n\n8\nreason, Applicant is not able to provide copies of these e-mails.  As long as risks of\nrecurrence and blackmail exist, Applicant\u2019s conduct cannot be mitigated, either under the\nguidelines or under the whole person concept.  \nFrom a whole person perspective, Applicant has established a good relationship\nof trust with his fiance and her family.  Much less is known, however, about his\nprofessional relationships with his colleagues and supervisors.  Whether his coworkers\nand supervisors are aware of his 2007 conviction is unclear. Without such clarity and\nemergence from probation (still two years away), he is not able mitigate the\nGovernment\u2019s security concerns at this time.\nIt is true that Applicant\u2019s telling his colleagues and supervisors about his\nrelationship with Y could  pose something of a dilemma for him.  Informing them of the\ndetails of his encounters, though, is a necessary prerequisite to absolving himself of risks\nof blackmail and other forms of pressure and coercion.  His continued probation status\nand registration as a sex offender also poses judgment, as well coercion and duress\nrisks This is a situation where strong family credits cannot overcome the security risks\nassociated with his judgment lapses, continued probation and sex offender registration\nstatus, and his potential exposure to exploitation, coercion and duress risks.  \nTaking into account all of the circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s e-mail\nrelationship with Y and ensuing conviction and sentencing, it is still too soon to absolve\nApplicant of security risks associated with his recurrent 2009 conviction and sentencing\ndisposition. Based on his recurrent exchanges with Y reflecting questionable judgment\nand trustworthiness concerns, his continued probation and sex offender registration\nstatus, and his potential risk to exploitation, coercion or duress, Applicant does not\nmitigate the Government\u2019s security concerns. Unfavorable conclusions warrant with\nrespect to the underlying conduct covered by subparagraphs 1.a through 1.c of\nGuideline J  and subparagraph 2.a of Guideline D. \nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the factors enumerated in Enclosure 2(a) of the Adjudicative Guidelines of the\nDirective.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE J: (CRIMINAL CONDUCT):        AGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSub-para. 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSub-para. 1.c\nAgainst Applicant\n \nGUIDELINE D: (SEXUAL BEHAVIOR):         AGAINST APPLICANT\n\n9\nSub-para. 2.a::\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

Edmunds, Esquire \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \nHARVEY, Mark W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant\u2019s statement of reasons (SOR) alleged nine delinquent debts, totaling \n$5,510. One debt was unsubstantiated. Three debts were included in her 2005 \nbankruptcy. Three debts were not established. She admitted responsibility for two \ndebts, had the funds to pay them and promised to pay them. However, she did not pay \nthose two debts, totaling about $1,156. Applicant failed to mitigate financial \nconsiderations security concerns. Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn February 9, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigation Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF 86) \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On June 30, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her,1 pursuant to Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, \n \n1Government Exhibit (GE) 9 (Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated June 30, 2008). GE 9 is the \nsource for the facts in the remainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise. \nNovember 28, 2008\n\n \n \n2 \n \n                                           \n1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended, modified and revised. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The SOR alleges \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The SOR detailed \nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the \nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for her, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn July 25, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested a \nhearing (GE 10). On August 25, 2008, the case was assigned to me. At the hearing held \non October 15, 2008, Department Counsel offered six exhibits (GEs 1-6) (Transcript \n(Tr.) 14-15, 66), and Applicant offered 26 exhibits (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE A-Z) (Tr. 16-\n17). There were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-6 and AE A-Z (Tr. 15, 17, 67-68). \nAdditionally, I admitted two Hearing Notices (GE 7, 8), the SOR (GE 9), Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to the SOR (GE 10), and post-hearing emails (GE 11, 12). At the hearing, I \nagreed to hold the record open until October 25, 2008, to permit Applicant to provide \nadditional documentation (Tr. 27-29). I received additional documentation on October \n23 and 24, 2008. I received the transcript on October 25, 2008. Applicant requested a \n30-day delay to gather additional documentation (AE AA, GE 11). Department counsel \nobjected to additional delay (GE 11). I approved a delay until November 21, 2008 (GE \n11). On November 26, 2008, Applicant said no documentation was being provided (GE \n12). I closed the record on November 28, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact2 \n \nIn her SOR response, Applicant admitted her 2005 chapter 7 bankruptcy and her \nresponsibility for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b to 1.g and 1.i (GE 9, 10). She denied the \ndebts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.j (GE 10). She said, \u201cI was able to readjust my budget \nso I can start making payments on my [SOR] debts. . . . I am trying to see if I [can] set \nup a payment plan to pay off these debts.\u201d (GE 10). Her admissions are incorporated \nherein as findings of fact.

She served on active duty in the Navy \nfrom November 1994 to January 1998. She served on active duty in the Army from May \n2000 to November 2001. She received an Honorable Discharge from the Army (AE W, \nY). She performed sensitive duty in the Army Inspector General\u2019s office in 2001 (AE X). \nShe married in 1995 and divorced in August 1999 (Tr. 21). She married in May 2001 \n(Tr. 85). Her children were born in 1997, 2004 and 2005 (Tr. 18-19). She does not have \na police record, a felony or military conviction, and did not use illegal drugs in a \nsensitive position or in the last seven years.  She disclosed on her 2007 SF 86 that in \nNovember 2005, her unsecured debts of about $28,926 were discharged in bankruptcy.  \n  \nApplicant\u2019s SOR alleged nine delinquent debts, totaling $5,510. She admitted \nresponsibility for two SOR debts totaling $1,156. Three debts were included in her 2005 \nbankruptcy (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d to 1.f). One debt was not substantiated (SOR \u00b6 1.g). Five debts \nremain for investigation and resolution and total $3,259 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h to 1.j). Their \ncurrent status is summarized in the table below: \n \nSOR PARAGRAPH \nAND TYPE OF \nDEBT \nAMOUNT\nSTATUS \n\u00b6 1.a Chapter 7 \nBankruptcy \n$28,926 \nDebts discharged on November 14, 2005 \n \n\u00b6 1.b Medical debt \n$903 \nAdmitted responsibility for delinquent debt (AE Z) \n\u00b6 1.c Medical debt \n$253 \nAdmitted responsibility for delinquent debt (AE Z) \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.d & 1.e Medical \nDebt \n$60 \nIncluded in bankruptcy (GE 3, Schedule F, page 4 \nof 9, Tr. 32)  \n\u00b6 1.f Medical \nJudgment \n$1,681 \nIncluded in bankruptcy (GE 3, Schedule F, page 7 \nof 9, Tr. 32) \n\u00b6 1.g Collection \nAgency debt \n$450 \nNot substantiated (AE T at 3, Tr. 33) \n\u00b6 1.h Best Buy \n$205 \nValidity being investigated.

Last act on account \nJune 2006 (GE 2)  \n\u00b6 1.j collection \nagency debt \n$1,331 \nValidity being investigated. Date opened in \nDecember 2005 (GE 2) \n \nApplicant had a difficult divorce in August 1999 (Tr. 21). Some of her delinquent \ndebts resulted from her divorce, and from her current husband\u2019s divorce (Tr. 21, 29). \nFor example, Applicant\u2019s name was on an apartment lease and her former husband \n\u201ctrashed\u201d the apartment (Tr. 30). Other SOR debts resulted from medical bills and a \nrepossessed vehicle (Tr. 22). As a result of Applicant\u2019s divorce, her medical insurance \nlapsed resulting in responsibility for some medical bills (Tr. 22). Applicant and her \ncurrent spouse discharged their debts in a bankruptcy in August 2005 (Tr. 39, SOR \u00b6 \n1.a, GE 10). The bankruptcy discharged $25,463 in unsecured debt (GE 3, Schedule F \nat 9).  \n\n \n \n4 \n \n                                           \nApplicant\u2019s response to DOHA interrogatories admitted that the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b, 1.c, 1.d and 1.e were her delinquent medical debts, claimed the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.g and 1.h were discharged by her bankruptcy, and asserted she could not locate \ninformation about SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j (GE 3). The DOHA interrogatories did not address \nthe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f (GE 3). Attached to her response to the DOHA interrogatories \nwere her 2007 bankruptcy schedules, which showed discharge of the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.d, 1.e and 1.f. The bankruptcy schedules did not show discharge of the debts in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h.  \n \nApplicant included a credit report dated April 29, 2008 in her response to her \nDOHA interrogatories, which showed the account in SOR \u00b6 1.g ($450) was opened in \nJanuary 2006, and became delinquent in February 2006 (GE 3). The credit limit was \n$300. Of course, her statement in her response to the DOHA interrogatories about this \naccount being part of her 2005 bankruptcy is clearly erroneous.4 Similarly, Applicant\u2019s \ncredit report dated April 29, 2008, showed the account in SOR \u00b6 1.h ($205) resulted \nfrom a returned check in July 2006 (GE 3). Her statement about this account being part \nof her 2005 bankruptcy is clearly erroneous. The April 29, 2008, credit report did not list \ndelinquent accounts for the creditors listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h (GE 3).      \n \nApplicant admitted responsibility for two medical bills in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c for \n$903 and $253, respectively (Tr. 30-32, 69, GE 3, 10). She did not have medical \ninsurance, and remembered the medical services she received (Tr. 31, 32). She did not \nreceive the bills from the doctor (Tr. 40). When she learned of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b, \nshe called the doctor\u2019s office, but she said they were unable or unwilling to provide \ninformation about the collection agency (Tr. 40). The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c arose from her \ndaughter\u2019s visit to an emergency room (Tr. 41). The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i is a medical debt \nfor $567, and Applicant promised to track that debt down within ten days and resolve it \n(Tr. 86-87). She said she was unable to locate the collection agency holding the debts, \nand her doctor refused to accept payment because he had assigned the debt (Tr. 31). \nShe promised to pay these two debts within ten days of her hearing (Tr. 70). On \nOctober 23, 2008, Applicant said in a letter that she was unable to pay the debts in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c because the creditors did not accept payment because the debts were \ndisputed and she wanted thirty days to pay the two debts (AE AA). I granted a delay \nuntil November 22, 2008, however, she did not provide any evidence that she had paid \nthese two debts (GE 12). \n \n \n \n4 In Applicant\u2019s response to Department Counsel\u2019s questions at her hearing about why she did \nnot contest the validity of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g sooner because it is specifically listed in her April 29, \n2008, credit report, which she submitted with her response to DOHA interrogatories (Tr. 50, GE 3).  First \nApplicant said she did not review the April 29, 2008, credit report before she submitted it (Tr. 50). She \nsaid she just printed her April 29, 2008, credit report out and turned it in (Tr. 51). Then she said she did \nnot understand it or read it (Tr. 51). However, she noted in her response to DOHA interrogatories that she \ncould not find information about the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j (GE 3), and in her SOR response she said she \ncould not find information about the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j in her credit report (indicating she did review the \ncredit report before she submitted it). \n\n \n \n5 \n \n                                           \nPotential Identity Theft \n \nApplicant\u2019s husband wrote letters to their creditors asking the creditors to \nsubstantiate the SOR debts (Tr. 26, 56, AE L, M, N, P, Q, S). The letters include the \nstatement, \u201cI do not recall having opened an account\u201d with the particular firm. It also \nthreatens a lawsuit if the creditor telephones Applicant, or if the information in credit \nreports is erroneous. It does not offer to pay for substantiated debts. She said she did \nnot read the letters before they were sent (Tr. 56-57). Her husband obtained the \nlanguage for the letters from a book about handling creditors and debt (Tr. 57). The \ncreditor in SOR \u00b6 1.g replied to her letter and said she was not responsible for the debt \n(Tr. 27, 33, 41, 58, AE T).  \n \nThe name on Applicant\u2019s credit report included an incorrect spelling for her \nname, as well as a multiple incorrect or incomplete addresses and an incorrect social \nsecurity number (Tr. 24-26, 59-60, 63-65, 68, AE V). On September 4, 2008, and \nOctober 8, 2008, Applicant wrote the credit report company asking for removal of the \nincorrect information from her credit report (AE V). The report itself notes a \u201cmismatch\u201d \nand \u201csecurity alert\u201d (Tr. 24). Her response to the potential identity theft was to file a \npolice report around October 1, 2008 (Tr. 26, 51). She filed the police report because \none creditor sent her a letter advising her to file a police report regarding the identity \ntheft (Tr. 52-53, AE T). She did not retain a copy of the police report (Tr. 27).5 She said \nif she was responsible for the debts she would \u201cgladly\u201d pay them off (Tr. 26).  \n \nAt her hearing, Applicant said she thought the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j for \n$567 and $1,331 were the product of identity theft (Tr. 34-35, 42). In her Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM) security interview6 and in her SOR response, she \nadmitted responsibility for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i (GE 10, Tr. 43) and denied \nresponsibility for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j (GE 10). She told the OPM investigator in March \n2007 the account in SOR \u00b6 1.i became delinquent just after she was divorced (in 1999) \n(Tr. 43). She explained the discrepancy, \u201cI didn\u2019t know. I was stupid. This was a wake-\nup call. I had no idea.\u201d (Tr. 35). She found out about the identify theft after she provided \nher SOR response (Tr. 35). She wrote the creditors about the debts (Tr. 35-36). If the \ndebts are hers, she has the funds and she promised to pay the debts (Tr. 36).   \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h for $205 resulted from a returned check (Tr. 34). She \ncontended her former husband paid the check using a bank that he no longer uses (Tr. \n34, 41). He was not able to get information showing his check was cashed because his \naccount was closed (Tr. 41). In her SOR response she said and at her hearing she \n \n5 Applicant said a copy of the police report would be provided within ten days of the hearing (Tr. \n99). Later in the hearing, Applicant\u2019s counsel was given until October 30, 2008, to submit documentation \n(Tr. 102). Upon request, I approved a delay for post-hearing submissions to November 22, 2008; \nhowever, the police report was never provided (GE 11). I do not consider Applicant\u2019s failure to provide the \npolice report as a negative reflection on Applicant\u2019s worthiness to hold a security clearance.  \n \n6 She said she was unable to remember most of her March 2007 OPM interview (Tr. 44-47). \n\n \n \n6 \n \nconsistently maintained the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h was a paid debt (GE 10, Tr. 34). \nHowever, she did not provide corroboration that the debt was paid (Tr. 34).  \n \nApplicant did not own any credit cards (Tr. 42). Her husband does have credit \ncards (Tr. 84-85). She was not familiar with the names of the account holders for the \ndisputed debts and concluded the accounts must be the product of identity theft (Tr. 42). \nApplicant currently earns $60,000 and her husband earns $73,000 annually (Tr. 23). \nTheir incomes are adequate to meet their expenses and pay their debts (Tr. 23).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit report, dated April 29, 2008, shows she borrowed $14,639 in \nApril 2006 for an automobile loan (GE 3). She makes her $334 monthly payment as \nagreed on her automobile loan, which currently has a balance of about $9,000 (GE 3, \nAE Z). However, her September 23, 2008, credit report showed her automobile loan as \n30 days past due and the amount past due of $139 (AE Z). A collection account with a \nbalance of $840 was reported as an overdraft in July 2008 (AE Z). Her 2008 credit \nreport did not show any mortgages, other vehicle loans, installment loans or open credit \ncard accounts. It listed her credit score as very poor and lower than 95% of the \npopulation (AE Z). \n \nAs of the date of her hearing, Applicant has no payment plans with any SOR \ncreditors (Tr. 61). She received credit counseling in mid-September 2008 (Tr. 62-63, AE \nAB).  SOR \u00b6 1.k indicates her personal financial statement dated April 29, 2008, shows \na negative $115 monthly remaining to address her SOR debts. Applicant\u2019s budget dated \nJuly 25, 2008, shows monthly income after deductions of $7,498, expenses of $5,707, \npayments to creditors of $1,500 with a positive remainder of $291 (AE K).

Some references have known her \nfor many years and others have only known her a few months. Applicant has worked for \nhigh-level Department of Defense officials in the past and her performance was \nexemplary (AE C, E, F, I). Applicant is loyal, has high energy, and is a great mother and \nloving wife (AE A, B, G). There was no evidence presented contradicting these positive \ncharacter traits and very positive recommendations. \n  \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Id. at \n527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \n\n \n \n8 \n \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude one relevant security concern is under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two financial considerations disqualifying conditions that could \nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) provides, \u201cApplicant\u2019s credit \nreport was sufficient to establish the Government\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant had . \n.  .  SOR delinquent debts that are of security concern.\u201d Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent \ndebt is documented in her credit reports (GE 2, 4, 5), her response to DOHA \ninterrogatories (GE 3), and her SOR response (GE 10). She used a Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy in 2005 to discharge $28,926 of delinquent debt. She consistently admitted \n\n \n \n9 \n \nthat she owed the debts listed SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. The issue of delinquent debt owed \nto the creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.i and 1.j remains for resolution. The government \nestablished the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). \u201cOnce a concern \narises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong \npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n07-00852 at 3 (App. Bd. May 27, 2008) (citing Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 \n(9th Cir. 1990)). Because the government has raised financial considerations security \nconcerns, the burden now shifts to Applicant to establish any appropriate mitigating \nconditions. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.       \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant application of AG \u00b6 20(a). She resolved her \ndelinquent debts using a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2005, and then she generated new \ndelinquent debt, showing her financial irresponsibility. Her financial problems are not \nisolated. The ongoing nature of her delinquent debts is \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d \nunder the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. \nAug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Moreover, I \nam not convinced her debts \u201coccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the [her] current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.\u201d Although she has been paying most of her debts, and the amount of \ndelinquent or unresolved debt is relatively low, she has failed to pay the debts she owes \neven though she has the means to pay her debts.  \n \n\n \n \n10 \n \n                                           \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant\u2019s divorce in August 1999 resulted in multiple debts \nthat were eventually discharged by her 2005 bankruptcy. Her post-2005 bankruptcy, \nmedically-related debt and her divorce-related debts are due to forces beyond her \ncontrol. However, she did not provide sufficient information to establish that she acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or made sufficient efforts to address her \ndelinquent debts especially those debts which accrued after her 2005 bankruptcy.7 She \nadmitted that she has not maintained contact with all of her creditors, and made very \nlimited efforts to pay the two debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c even though she had the \nfinancial means to pay these two medical debts.     \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) have limited application. Applicant received financial \ncounseling. There are some indications that \u201cthat the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control\u201d because the amount of delinquent debt is not that large, and there is \ninsufficient evidence to establish that she has new delinquent debt. However, there is \nalso insufficient information to establish that Applicant showed good faith8 in the \nresolution of her delinquent SOR debts because she did not establish that her failure to \npay the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c was reasonable and necessary under the \ncircumstances. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) mitigates her debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i and 1.j. The \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e and 1.f were clearly included in her 2005 Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy. Department counsel conceded there was sufficient evidence to establish \nthe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e and 1.f were discharged in her 2005 bankruptcy (Tr. 11-\n12). The creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.g waived collection of any debt owed in SOR \u00b6 1.g. \nApplicant admitted her responsibility for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b to 1.g and 1.i in her \n \n7\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether he or she maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \n \n8The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n\n \n \n11 \n \n                                           \nSOR response. However, as indicated previously the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f \nwere included in her bankruptcy, undercutting the validity of her admissions and \nshowing how she either lacks financial sophistication or attention to detail. Her husband \nwrote the creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.i, and 1.j seeking \u201cdocumented proof to \nsubstantiate\u201d that she owed these debts.9 Debts are often transferred to other creditors \nand collection agents. It is reasonable and prudent for debtors to seek proof the debt is \nvalid and has been properly assigned before making payments. I therefore find \u201cFor \nApplicant\u201d with respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i and 1.j.      \n \nI find \u201cFor Applicant\u201d on SOR \u00b6 1.a because her bankruptcy in 2005 is a legally \nauthorized method of resolving delinquent debts. It provided her a fresh financial start, \nand with her ample income she should have been able to avoid financial problems. Her \nbankruptcy is still relevant under the whole person concept to show her history of \ndelinquent debt and her failure to repay creditors that had their debts discharged. See \nn.8, supra, addressing the issue of bankruptcy in the context of mitigating financial \nconsiderations security concern by showing good faith. I find \u201cFor Applicant\u201d on SOR \u00b6 \n1.b because her budgets dated July 25, 2008, and October 22, 2008, show a positive \nbalance that she may use to address her delinquent debts (AE K, AB).  \n \nI conclude Applicant\u2019s overall conduct in regard to her delinquent debts casts \ndoubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. She failed to \nresolve or pay two creditors, who she owed about $1,156 for medical treatments. She \npromised to pay these two creditors at her hearing, and did not do so. She did not \nprovide good cause for her failure to pay these debts despite having an opportunity to \ndo so. Based on my evaluation of the record evidence as a whole, I conclude financial \nconsiderations with respect to the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c are not mitigated.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n \n9Her husband addressed their delinquent debts by sending her creditors letters asking them to \nprove the legitimacy of the debts, even though he knew some of the debts were legitimate. He did not \ninclude information showing the legitimacy of underlying debts and he did not promise to pay the debts \nthat were substantiated. Some of those contested debts may ultimately prove to be Applicant\u2019s delinquent \ndebts. \n\n \n \n12 \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nThere is some evidence tending to mitigate Applicant\u2019s conduct under the whole \nperson concept. She is either not financially sophisticated, or lacks attention to detail. \nShe was confused about which debts were resolved in her 2005 bankruptcy. She made \nmistakes, and her debts became delinquent. She discharged her delinquent debts in \n2005 using bankruptcy, which is a legally authorized method of resolving her debts. Her \ndedication to her work, her children and her spouse is a very positive indication of her \ngood character and trustworthiness. She is completely loyal to her country. Applicant\u2019s \nrecord of good employment, and solid military record weighs in her favor. There is no \nevidence of any security violation, or criminal activity. Her non-SOR debts are current \nand being paid. These factors show some responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation.  \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept and the adjudicative \nguidelines are not sufficient to warrant access to classified information. Although the \noverall amount of unresolved debt is $1,156 and not substantial, she has the funds to \npay these two debts, promised to pay these two debts at her hearing, had ample time to \nresolve these two debts and yet has chosen not to pay these two debts. Moreover her \n2005 bankruptcy documentation lists numerous delinquent debts, which provides a \nlengthy history or track record of delinquent debt. Applicant has been aware of her post-\n2005 allegedly delinquent SOR debts since the SOR was issued, and she did not \nrespond to security concerns with alacrity. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude she has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.      \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude she is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b and 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d to 1.k: \n For Applicant \n\n \n \n13 \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nMark W. Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On \nOctober 29, 2008, I received an undated response to the FORM. Government counsel \nhaving no objection to the material, it was admitted as exhibit (Ex.) A. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations of the SOR.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 29-year-old system analyst who has worked for a defense \ncontractor since June 2006, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance.  \n \n \nIn 1997, Applicant\u2014then age 17\u2014used crack cocaine. He has never again \nsmoked crack cocaine and does not associate with the people present when he used it. \nFrom February 2000 to July 2004, Applicant used cocaine 15 times. This use occurred \nprimarily with one person who has since moved from the area. In October 2007, \nApplicant used cocaine with a friend. Applicant regrets using cocaine on this occasion \nand no longer associates with this person.  \n \nFrom May 1996 to February 2005, Applicant used marijuana. (Item 4) In May \n2001, he was charged with possession of marijuana and drug paraphernalia. The \ncharges were dismissed. During the summer of 2004, Applicant began to re-evaluate \nhis drug usage. In August 2004, Applicant married. He continued to occasionally use \nmarijuana until February 2005. During this period, there were times when Applicant \nwould abstain from using marijuana for extended periods of time. Some friends still use \nmarijuana, but Applicant has made it clear he no longer uses marijuana and informed \nhis friends not to bring marijuana around him.  \n \nFrom February 2000 to March 2002, Applicant\u2014aged 20 to 22\u2014used LSD six \ntimes. (Item 6) Applicant has not associated with the people he used LSD with and has \nabstained from further use of LSD.  \n \nIn September 2008, Applicant and his wife celebrated one year in their home. In \nJanuary 2008, their son was born. Applicant asserts he is drug free and intends to \nremain so. He also asserts the factors leading to his drug usage are no longer in his life. \n\n \n \n \n3\nThe people with whom he now associates share his same goals and aspirations for \nraising families.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n\n \n \n \n4\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nDrug Involvement \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement in that \nthe use of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and \nbecause it raises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(a) any drug abuse;  \n \n(b) testing positive for illegal drug use; \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical \npsychologist, or psychiatrist) of drug abuse or drug dependence; \n \n(e) evaluation of drug abuse or drug dependence by a licensed clinical social \nworker who, is a staff member of a recognized drug treatment program; \n \n(f) failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program prescribed by a duly \nqualified medical professional; \n \n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance; and, \n \n(h) expressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and \nconvincingly commit to discontinue drug use. \n \nBetween 1997 and October 2007, Applicant purchased and or used cocaine, \nLSD, and marijuana. In 2001, he was arrested for marijuana possession and drug \nparaphernalia possession. AG \u00b6 25(a) drug abuse and AG \u00b6 25(c) purchasing illegal \ndrugs, apply.  \n \nAG \u00b6 26 sets forth conditions that could mitigate security concerns.  \n \n\n \n \n \n5\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and, \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any \nviolation; \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness during \nwhich these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and, \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including but \nnot limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse, \nand a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional. \n \nApplicant asserts he no longer associates with those individuals with whom he \nused illegal drugs and will no longer use illegal drugs. Because Applicant chose to have \nthis matter handled administratively, I am unable to test the veracity of his assertions. I \nam unable to evaluate his demeanor, appearance, or to form a positive determination \nas to his truthfulness. From the record, I am unable to find Applicant was sincere, open, \nand honest. \n \nNone of the conditions that could mitigate security concerns apply. AG \u00b6 26(a) \nonly partially applies because his illegal drug use appears to be infrequent. His use did \nnot occur under unusual circumstances and his use does cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. Additionally, illegal drugs were used over a period \nof ten years. \n \nAG \u00b6 26(b) does not apply. His assertion he no longer associates with drug-using \nfriends does not apply. Applicant acknowledges some of his friends still smoke \nmarijuana, but he has made it clear to them not to bring marijuana around him. He still \nsees these individuals. Additionally, I am unable to test the veracity of his statement he \nno longer associates with those individuals with whom he previously used illegal drugs. \nThere is no showing he has executed a signed statement of intent with automatic \nrevocation of clearance for any violation. It has been one year since his last use of \ncocaine. Considering the ten year history of his use this period of abstinence is \ninsufficient. \n \n\n \n \n \n6\nAG \u00b6 26(c) does not apply because prescription drugs were not abused. AG \u00b6 \n26(d) does not apply because Applicant was never in aftercare.  \n \nIn May 2001, Applicant was charged with possession of marijuana and \npossession of drug paraphernalia. The charges were dismissed. Without more, the only \ninference to be drawn from these dismissed charges that was that Applicant was on \nnotice as to the seriousness of marijuana possession. I find for Applicant as to SOR \u00b6 \n1.f. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. In August 2004, Applicant married. \nHowever, he continued to use marijuana and cocaine after his marriage. In January \n2008, his son was born, which often has a maturing effect on an individual. Applicant \nasserts he is drug free, intends to remain drug free, and the factors leading to his drug \nusage are no longer in his life. However, I have no way of ascertaining the veracity of \nthese assertions \n \nHis last cocaine use occurred one year ago. I am unable to make a finding that \nillegal drugs are no longer a part of his life. The awarding of a security clearance is not a \nonce in a life time occurrence, but is based on current disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions. Although the Applicant=s evidence of rehabilitation is insufficient at this time, \nshould he in the future be afforded an opportunity to reapply for a security clearance, \nwith the passage of sufficient additional time, continued rehabilitation, and no future \nincidents of illegal drug usage or misconduct, he may well demonstrate persuasive \nevidence of his security worthiness. But that time has not yet arrived.  \n \n\n \n \n \n7\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the drug involvement security concerns. \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, drug involvement: AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a-e: \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n",

The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on May 5, 2008, and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to another Administrative \nJudge on June 16, 2008, and reassigned to me on July 2, 2008. DOHA issued a notice \nof hearing on July 17, 2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled on August 13, 2008. \nAugust 29, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nThe Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were received without \nobjection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits (AE) A through F, \nwhich were received without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record \nopen until August 22, 2008, to submit additional matters. Applicant submitted three \ndocuments marked AE G though I, and admitted without objection. Department \nCounsel\u2019s memo is marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on August 21, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since September 2006. He attended college for a period but did \nnot obtain a degree. He served in the U.S. Navy on active duty from 1993 to 1994. He \nreceived an Honorable Discharge for disability. He received severance pay of $3,733 \nbut elected not to submit a claim for disability as he feels that he is capable of working. \nHe is currently married and was married twice previously to other women. His first \nmarriage ended in divorce. His second marriage was void because he married his \nsecond spouse before his divorce was final. He has four children between the ages 15 \nand 10. The four children live with their mothers. He pays child support for the two \noldest children. The mother of the youngest two children has not requested child \nsupport on their behalf.1  \n \n \nThe SOR lists 31 debts totaling approximately $26,049. Applicant admitted to \nowing all the debts in the SOR with the exception of \u00b6 1.ee, which he denied; 1.z, which \nhe neither denied nor admitted; \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and 1.y, which he stated were the same debts as \nlisted in \u00b6 1.c; \u00b6 1.aa, which he stated was the same debt as listed in \u00b6 1.e; and \u00b6\u00b6 1.f \nand 1.m, which he admitted to the debts but stated they were being paid by \ngarnishment.  \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to recurrent medical issues, not having \nmedical insurance, and not earning enough money. He was unemployed for about three \nmonths in 2004. His wife is disabled and has been unable to work since about April \n2008.2 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b lists a debt of $263 to a collection company on behalf of a telephone \nservices company. Applicant submitted a bill dated April 9, 2008, from another collection \ncompany showing the balance owed on the account as $382. He stated that the \ncompany has agreed to accept $105 in settlement of the debt, but he has not paid it \nyet.3 \n \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 27, 35; GE 1; AE I. \n \n2 Tr. at 17-18, 20-21, 26-27; GE 1. \n \n3 Tr. at 17; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE B. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing the debt of $680 as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c for a student \nloan. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and 1.y are duplicates of this debt.4 \n \n \nA financial institution obtained a judgment of $5,939 against Applicant in July \n2004. The judgment is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f. The judgment is being paid by \ngarnishment. The amount garnished varies depending on how much Applicant earns in \na given pay period. His March 2008 pay statement showed that $44 was garnished for \nthe two-week pay period, and $799 year-to-date. He was unable to state how much he \nstill owes on the judgment.5 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.m alleges that as of October 26, 2006, Applicant was $8,669 in arrears \non his child support as enforced by the county. The credit report of October 24, 2006, \nshows this debt as past due in the amount of $8,669, with a balance of $8,997. \nApplicant admitted to this debt but stated it was being paid by garnishment. He \nsubmitted documentation that his pay is being garnished $189 every two weeks. He \nstated that $328 is taken out for current support and the rest for his arrears. He also \nstated that his income tax refunds have been seized to pay this debt. He submitted \ndocumentation that $915 was taken out of his income tax refund on June 6, 2008, and \npaid to this debt. He stated that about $3,500 was seized from his income tax refund in \n2006. He submitted documentation from his income tax preparer that he was due a \nrefund of $3,572 in 2006. The document indicated a refund anticipation loan check of \n$3,249 would be available from his income tax preparer within one to two days. \nApplicant did not submit documentation that the refund was taken for his back child \nsupport. He was unable to state how much he still owes for the arrears.6 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.z alleges a debt of $201. Applicant failed to admit or deny this debt in \nhis response to the SOR. Applicant specifically named this debt on his Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions certified as true on October 3, 2006. It is also listed on the \ncredit report of October 24, 2006, but states that it was assigned to a collection agency. \nThe debt is not listed on the credit report of February 1, 2008. Applicant testified that he \nwas unfamiliar with the creditor but it was likely a medical debt and he was willing to \nadmit that he owed it.7 \n \n \nApplicant admitted owing the debt of $296 to a telephone service company, as \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.aa, but stated it was a duplicate of SOR \u00b6 1.e, which alleged a debt \nof $149 to a company collecting on behalf of that same telephone service company. \nAfter reviewing the evidence, I further find that the debt of $371 to a collection company, \nas alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.x is also a duplicate of this debt.8 \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 18-19, 23; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3, 4. \n \n5 Tr. at 19-20; Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR; GE 2. \n \n6 Tr. at 14-17; Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR; GE 1-3; AE G, H. \n \n7 Tr. at 24; GE 1, 3, 4. \n \n8 Tr. at 18-19, 23; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3, 4. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant denied owing the debt of $426 to a financial institution, as alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.ee. This debt is listed on the credit report of October 24, 2006, but is not listed \non the credit report of February 1, 2008. Applicant wrote \u201cthis one don\u2019t know about.\u201d \nThis is the only debt that Applicant totally denied being his responsibility. I find he is not \naccountable for this debt.9 \n \n \nApplicant has not paid any of the other debts listed in the SOR. He indicated that \nwith the garnishments for the judgment and his back child support, he cannot afford to \npay the other debts. Many of the debts are for medical expenses. Applicant consulted \nwith a debt management company in February 2008. He was financially unable to utilize \ntheir program as shortly thereafter his wife had to stop working. He has not received \nfinancial counseling.10  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, Administrative Judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative \nJudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n                                                          \n9 Tr. at 24; GE 1, 3, 4. \n \n10 Tr. at 25-32. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable to pay his \nobligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise both of these \npotentially disqualifying conditions.  \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n\n \n6 \n \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant still owes most of the debts alleged in the SOR. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not \napplicable. He attributed his financial problems to recurrent medical issues, not having \nmedical insurance, and not earning enough money. He was also unemployed for about \nthree months in 2004, and his wife is disabled and has been unable to work since about \nApril 2008. These are conditions that were largely beyond his control. To be fully \napplicable, AG \u00b6 20(b) also requires that the individual act responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Applicant did not submit sufficient information for a finding that he has \nacted responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) is partially applicable.  \n \nApplicant has not received financial counseling. There are not clear indications \nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) is not applicable. The \nonly debts that are being paid are being done involuntarily through garnishment or \nattachment of Applicant\u2019s income tax refunds. That is insufficient to warrant full \napplication of AG \u00b6 20(d). Applicant is given credit under AG \u00b6 20(e) for those debts he \ndisputed, as addressed in the Findings of Fact. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n\n \n7 \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s military \nservice to our country and that he is a disabled veteran. However, his finances have \nbeen in bad shape for a number of years with no sign of improvement in the foreseeable \nfuture. They remain a security concern. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nissues.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.k: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.m-1.w:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.x-1.y: \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.z:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.aa:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.bb-1.dd:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.ee:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nEdward W.

In her answer to the SOR, she failed to admit or deny SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m \u2013 1.p. At her hearing, she admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m \u2013 1.p were her or her children\u2019s medical debts (Tr. 42). Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 33-year-old security associate working for a Government contractor. She has never been married. She has three children, ages 15, 11, and 2. After completing high school in 1992, she had her first son. From 1993 to 1997, she worked full time for numerous employers in positions such as receptionist, cashier, and waitress (Tr. 45). She also worked for a temporary work agency. In 1997, she had her daughter and had to stop working for approximately one year. From 1998 to 2001, she resumed working full time in similar job positions (Tr. 48). From 2001 to 2006, Applicant ran her own child care provider business from her home (Tr. 48-49). In 2006, she was pregnant with her baby, and had difficulty running the child care business. In October 2006, Applicant was hired as a part-time security associate by a Government contractor and received interim access to classified information (Tr. 15).

Her evidence is insufficient to show that she is \nin control of her finances, is not overextended, and has a track record of financial \nresponsibility. She failed to mitigate security concerns regarding Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn January 24, 2007, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for Sensitive \nPositions or Standard Form (SF) 85P.1 On February 29, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her,2 pursuant \nto Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive \n \n1  GE 1.  \n \n2  GE 1 is the source for the facts in the remainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise. \nSeptember 12, 2008\n\n \n \n2 \n \n                                                          \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.3 The SOR alleges security \nconcerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The SOR detailed reasons why \nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nher, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 17, 2008, and requested a hearing before \nan Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on June 10, 2008. DOHA \nissued a notice of hearing on June 17, 2008. The hearing was convened as scheduled \non July 7, 2008. The government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which \nwere admitted without objection (Tr. 19). Applicant testified on her own behalf, and \npresented no exhibits. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 15, \n2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c \u2013 1.e, and 1.g \u2013 1.l, with explanations. She \ndenied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.f. In her answer to the SOR, she failed to admit or deny SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.m \u2013 1.p. At her hearing, she admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m \u2013 1.p were her or her children\u2019s \nmedical debts (Tr. 42). Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After \na complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is a 33-year-old security associate working for a Government \ncontractor. She has never been married. She has three children, ages 15, 11, and 2. \nAfter completing high school in 1992, she had her first son. From 1993 to 1997, she \nworked full time for numerous employers in positions such as receptionist, cashier, and \nwaitress (Tr. 45). She also worked for a temporary work agency. In 1997, she had her \ndaughter and had to stop working for approximately one year. From 1998 to 2001, she \nresumed working full time in similar job positions (Tr. 48). From 2001 to 2006, Applicant \nran her own child care provider business from her home (Tr. 48-49). In 2006, she was \npregnant with her baby, and had difficulty running the child care business. \n \n \nIn October 2006, Applicant was hired as a part-time security associate by a \nGovernment contractor and received interim access to classified information (Tr. 15). \nShe worked 20 hours a week and was paid approximately $12.50 an hour. Because of \nher good performance, she was offered a full-time security associate position. She \n \n \n3  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n\n \n \n3 \n \nworked full-time for approximately six months before her interim access was withdrawn \nbecause of the concerns alleged in the SOR (Tr. 21-22). She needs access to classified \ninformation to do her job. Applicant was forced to go back to a part-time work schedule \nfor some time. As of her hearing date, she was unemployed (Tr. 60). She explained she \nis having trouble finding a job that would pay enough for her to pay a babysitter and with \na convenient schedule for her to take care of her children.  \n \nThere is no evidence to show that she has compromised or caused others to \ncompromise classified information. Nor is there evidence showing that she has ever \nfailed to follow the rules and procedures required to handle classified information. She \nhas no police record, and there is no evidence she has used or trafficked in illegal \ndrugs. \n \nApplicant has custody of her three children. Her 15-year-old son receives $325 in \nsupport from his father (Tr. 25, 50). Her 11-year-old daughter receives no support from \nher father. The father of her two-year-old son works as a bus driver and provides some \nfinancial support to the household. Applicant\u2019s mother is disabled; however, she does \nnot live with and is not financially dependent on Applicant (Tr. 63). Applicant has \nreceived state assistance in the form of subsidized housing since 2002. Her rent is \nlimited to 30% of her income (Tr. 51). She is currently receiving unemployment benefits.  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed her financial situation and \nincluded the review of her SF 86, her responses to DOHA interrogatories (GE 2), and \nthree credit bureau reports (CBRs) one from 2007 (GE 5 ), and two from 2008 (GE 3 & \n4). The SOR alleges 16 delinquent/charged off accounts totaling approximately $8,740.  \n \nApplicant admitted that most of the debts alleged in SOR are her debts and have \nbeen delinquent for a long period of time. She denied the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b \n($95) claiming she paid and/or entered into a new service agreement with the creditor \n(Tr. 34, 52). She denied SOR \u00b6 1.f ($55) and claimed in her answer to the SOR that she \nrecently paid the debt. At her hearing, she contradicted her SOR answer and claimed \nshe talked to the creditor after receipt of her SOR and the creditor had agreed to \u201ctake \noff\u201d the debt from her CBR (Tr. 41, 56). She presented no documentary evidence to \nsupport her claims.   \n \nApplicant explained her financial problems were caused by a combination of \nfactors; i.e., she is a single mother of three, and for the most part, the sole provider for \nher children; being underemployed or unemployed; and not having medical insurance \ncoverage for her and her children. She noted most of the delinquent debts resulted from \nmedical services she could not afford (Tr. 21-22). \n \nApplicant explained that although her delinquent debts are relatively small, she \nnever made any effort to contact her creditors and did not pay any of her debts because \n\n \n \n4 \n \nshe could not afford to pay for her day-to-day living expenses and her past financial \nobligations (Tr. 68).  \n \nApplicant claimed she started trying to correct her financial situation when she \nwas hired full-time. She testified she made payment arrangement and/or settlement \nagreements with some of her creditors (Tr. 29). She was waiting to receive her 2007 \nincome tax refund to pay some of her debts, but since she was laid off in March 2008, \nshe decided to use the money to support her children. She presented no documentary \nevidence to support her claims. \n \nFrom November 2007 to March 2008, Applicant was earning approximately \n$1,900 a month (Tr. 31). She receives $325 for child support for her oldest son. Her \nmonthly rent was $550. Her monthly expenses were as follows: utilities $400; food \n$300, and day care $560. In 2002, she bought a new Mazda Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 which was \nrepossessed in 2006. In March 2008, she bought a 2003 GMC Envoy because she \nneeded it to get to work, and to take her children to day care. As of the day of the \nhearing, she was two months late on the payments (Tr. 59). She indicated no car \ninsurance or car payment in her financial statements.  \n \nApplicant has not sought or participated in any financial counseling. She knows \nher debts are small and she believes she can take care of her financial problems on her \nown. She knows she has been financially irresponsible and promised to do better if she \ncan get her full time job back (Tr. 43). Applicant expressed remorse for her past \nfinancial problems. She asserted she is doing the best she can under her \ncircumstances. She noted her good job performance and that she is responsible and \nreliable.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n\n \n \n5 \n \n                                                          \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d4 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).5 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the relevant security concern is under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \n4  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n5  \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is well documented in her credit reports, her SOR \nresponse, and her testimony. Through the years, she acquired numerous debts which \nbecame delinquent and have remained outstanding. As of the hearing date, she had 16 \noutstanding debts totaling approximately $8,740. The government established the \ndisqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n                                                          \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,6 I conclude that none of the \nmitigating conditions apply. Applicant presented little evidence of efforts taken to contact \ncreditors, or to resolve any of the debts since she acquired them. Nor is there any \nevidence that she has participated in any financial counseling.   \n \nI specifically considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition AG \u00b6 20(b) \nand conclude it applies, but only to a limited extent. Applicant\u2019s testimony established \nfactors that may be considered as circumstances beyond her control contributing to her \ninability to pay her debts, i.e., being a single mother and sole provider for her three \nchildren, the lack of financial assistance from one of her children\u2019s fathers; and her \nperiods of unemployment or underemployment.  \n \nNotwithstanding, Applicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to show she has dealt \nresponsibly with her financial obligations before, or after receipt of the SOR. Applicant \nhas been consistently employed and earned money for extended periods of time. She \npresented little or no evidence to show paid debts, settlements, documented \nnegotiations, payment plans, budgets, or financial assistance/counseling. Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial history and lack of favorable evidence preclude a finding that she has \nestablished a track record of financial responsibility, or that she has taken control of her \nfinancial situation. Based on the available evidence, she is overextended financially and \nher financial problems are likely to be a concern in the future. Her financial problems are \nrecent, not isolated, and ongoing.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). \n \n6  See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 at 4 (App. \nBd. May 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis for FC MC 1, all debts are considered as a whole. \n\n \n \n8 \n \nApplicant\u2019s work for the Government contractor weighs in her favor. She started \nin a part-time position and because of her good performance was selected to a full-time \nposition. She had interim access to classified information for almost two years and there \nis no evidence that she compromised classified information. Aside from her delinquent \ndebts (which are a civil, non-criminal issue), she is a law-abiding citizen and a \nconcerned mother. She expressed regrets for her financial mistakes and claimed she is \ntrying to correct them.  \n \nConsidering the totality of the circumstances in her case, including Applicant\u2019s \nage, education, and maturity, she demonstrated a lack of judgment and trustworthiness \nin the handling of her financial affairs. She failed to deal responsibly with her financial \nobligations. Her failure or inability to live within her means and to meet her financial \nobligations indicates poor self-control or an unwillingness to abide by rules and \nregulations. Based on the available evidence, she is overextended financially and her \nfinancial problems are likely to be a concern in the future.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has failed to \nmitigate the security concerns pertaining to financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.p:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant.

On June 19, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the\ncase assignment on September 9, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nSeptember 16, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on October 15, 2008.\nThe Government offered Exhibits (GE 1-4), which were received without objection.\nApplicant testified in her own behalf. She submitted Exhibits (AE A-C), without\nOctober 30, 2008\n\n2\nobjection. DOHA received the transcript on October 22, 2008. Based upon a review of\nthe record, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated July 21, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.m, and 1.p through 1.q, of the SOR. She denied the\nother allegations in the SOR because the debts were paid or she had no knowledge of\nthem. She provided additional information to support her request for eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. \nApplicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She graduated from\nhigh school in 1987. She married in 1998 and divorced in 2001. She has no children (Tr.\n25). She has been employed since January 2006 with her current employer (GE 1).\nIn 2005, Applicant was self-employed as a chef. She has continued with the\nbusiness on a part time basis (Tr. 113). She worked in various positions since high\nschool. Applicant had a period of unemployment in 2002 and 2003 totaling\napproximately six months (Tr. 26).\nApplicant was in an automobile accident in June 2007. She was not at fault in the\naccident. She received injuries and lost some time from work (Tr. 23). She is working\nwith the insurance company to settle the medical debts that she has incurred. The\nmedical debts are approximately $50,000. She is paying $160 monthly on one of the\nlarge medical debts ($10,000) incurred from the accident. She has not paid the other\nmedical bills (GE 3).\nApplicant had an injury to her knee in 2008 due to a fall at a hockey game. She\nrequired surgery on her knee after that. She was out of work recuperating for\napproximately two weeks (Tr. 28). She also received physical therapy. \nThe SOR alleges 19 delinquent debts/collection accounts including, unpaid\nmedical debt and six collection accounts. The total amount of the delinquent debt is\napproximately $37,000.\nSOR \u00b6 1.a is a collection account in the amount of $6,262. Applicant admitted\nthat she owed the debt. Applicant explained that she met someone on the internet in\n2003 and received two money orders from the person when they were out of the\ncountry in 2003. She deposited the money in her bank account and then sent the\nperson cash from her account. The money orders were fraudulent and her bank\ncharged the amount against her account (Tr. 58). She attempted to get her money back\nfrom the friend but it was not paid. The amount was sent to collection and is now a\ngarnishment since July 2008 (Tr. 64). She is paying $112 weekly. The balance is\napproximately $3,574 (Tr. 65; AE B).\n\n3\nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a collection account (cable) in the amount of $309. Applicant is\npaying $50 a month (AE C).\nSOR \u00b6 1.c is a medical account for $27. Applicant\u2019s insurance company did not\npay for this amount. She has not paid the account.\nSOR \u00b6 1.d is for a medical account in the amount of $15. Applicant has not paid\nthe amount.\nSOR \u00b6 1.e is for a medical account in the amount of $12. Applicant has not paid\nthis account.\nSOR \u00b6 1.f is for a medical account in the amount of $13. Applicant has not paid\nthis account.\nSOR \u00b6 1.g is for a medical account in the amount of $12. Applicant has not paid\nthe co-payment because she is waiting for an insurance settlement.\nSOR \u00b6 1.h. is another medical account in the amount of $14. Applicant has not\npaid this account.\nSOR \u00b6 1.i is a collection account for medical in the amount of $318. Applicant\nhas not paid this account.\nSOR \u00b61.j is a charged off medical account in the amount of $102. Applicant is\npaying on this debt since June 2008. She pays $50 a month (AE C).\nSOR 1.k is a medical debt of $270. This account is for a bill that Applicant\nbelieved had already been paid. She is not trying to work out a payment plan at this\npoint in time (Tr. 73).\nSOR 1.l is for a collection account for a mortgage in the amount of $31,481.\nApplicant explained that she and her ex-husband purchased a home. She left the home\nwhen they separated. He continued to live in the home. She believed he was paying the\nmortgage. In 2002, she learned that she was also responsible for the mortgage (Tr. 76).\nThe house was auctioned and she owed $17,000. She contacted the mortgage\ncompany but does not have the money to pay at this point in time (Tr. 40). After\nspeaking to the lawyer for the mortgage company, Applicant has decided that she would\nfile bankruptcy in the future (Tr. 40).\nSOR 1.m is for a medical account $672. This account is the same account as\nmentioned in the above SOR 1.j. Applicant is paying on this account.\nSOR 1.n is a charged off account in the amount of $848 which Applicant denies.\nShe explained that she has no idea what the account is for because she never had an\n\n4\naccount with that company. She wrote to the company recently to dispute it and\nprovided documentation to support this. \nSOR 1.o is a charged off account in the amount of $575 which Applicant denies.\nShe disputes the credit card account because she has not had a credit card with the\ncompany since 1999 (Tr. 42). Applicant also noted she believes there is another person\nwith her name who sometimes appears on her credit report. She has no documentation\nfor this proposition (Tr. 84).\nSOR 1.p is a phone account charged off in the amount of $170. Applicant\nexplained that the cell phone was one that her ex-husband used. She received a bill in\n2000 but did not pay it. She wanted her husband to pay the account. She has not paid it\n(Tr. 46).\nSOR 1.q is another charged off account for a phone in the amount of $706.\nApplicant believes this is a duplicate of the phone bill referenced in the above allegation.\nShe thinks it is a combination of the disconnection fee and the actual bill. She called\nand was told it was written off and no longer on record.\nSOR 1.r is a charged off account in the amount of $66 which Applicant denies\nbecause she believes she has paid it. She did not have any documentation to support\nthis (Tr. 47).\nSOR 1.s is for a collection account in the amount of $695 which Applicant denies\nbecause it is a duplicate of the account alleged in 1.o. in the SOR.\nApplicant\u2019s current monthly net income is $1,280, decreased from $1,613 on her\npersonal financial statement. This is due to less overtime work. After monthly expenses\nand payment on some debt, she has a negative cash flow (Tr. 121). She is current with\nher car payment. She has no bank savings.\nApplicant remarried in 2008. She and her husband do not pool their money. He\ndoes pay for certain household expenses. He has his school loans to pay and some\ncredit card debt that he owns (Tr. 96).\nApplicant has not received financial counseling other than speaking to the\nattorney for the mortgage company who told her she needed to pay the amount left on\nthe home or file bankruptcy. She has no repayment plan in place for many of her debts.\nShe stated at the hearing that she may file for bankruptcy at some point. She has not\npaid the remaining medical debts because she is waiting for a settlement from the\ninsurance company. She did not provide any documentation for this proposition.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\n\n5\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\n\n6\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant has numerous delinquent debts and could not meet her\nfinancial obligations from 2000 until the present. The evidence is sufficient to raise these\npotentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying\nconditions may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so\ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does\nnot cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@\nApplicant=s financial worries are partially the result of an automobile accident and a\ndivorce. However her delinquent debts have various sources and have been ongoing.\nThis potentially mitigating condition does not apply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, her\nfinancial problems may have increased with her divorce and later accident in 2007, but\nApplicant did not act responsibly in identifying and resolving her debts which preceded\nthose events. She did not take an active stance when she learned about many of them.\nApplicant has worked steadily for many years with a few periods of unemployment, I\nfind this potentially mitigating condition does not apply.\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). This does not apply. Applicant has no budget\nand has had no financial counseling. She is paying one debt through a recent\ngarnishment. She does not have a handle on her financial affairs. \nAG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant waited\nmany years before attempting to resolve her financial issues. She is paying on some of\n\n7\nher debts and one debt has been resolved through a recent garnishment. I conclude\nthis potentially mitigating condition does not apply.\nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d In this case, Applicant stated that the alleged\ndebts were unknown to her. She has not provided sufficient documentation. I conclude\nthis potentially mitigating condition does not apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude that under the whole\nperson, there is not sufficient mitigation to overcome the government\u2019s case.\nApplicant has worked for number of years. She did have an automobile accident\nthat was not her fault. She is waiting for an insurance settlement to pay the medical\nbills. However, there were a number of small co-payments that could have been paid.\nApplicant also separated and divorced her husband. That exacerbated her difficulties.\nThe largest debt is the result of the marital home mortgage. Applicant has not\naddressed this until this year. She is contemplating filing bankruptcy. This is a legal\nmeans of resolving debt. However, she has not initiated any proceedings. Also, her poor\njudgment in sending money to someone she met through the internet and then not\npaying until a lawsuit resulted in garnishment this year does not provide for mitigation in\nthis case. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising under financial\nconsiderations. \n\n8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In her Answer to the SOR, dated June 11, 2008, Applicant denied the factual allegations of the SOR.2 Applicant, who is 52 years old, works as a business development director for a Department of Defense contractor. She has held this position for 19 months. Her employer requested that she apply for a security clearance.

On June 6, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines E and H\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 10, 2008.

DOHA received the request on June 16, 2008. Department Counsel was\nprepared to proceed on June 30, 2008, and I received the case assignment on July 11,\n2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on July 15, 2008, and I convened the hearing as\nscheduled on August 6, 2008. The government offered six exhibits (GE) 1 through 6,\nwhich were received and admitted into evidence without objection.  Applicant and one\n1\nwitness testified on her behalf. She submitted 11 exhibits (AE) A through K, which were\nreceived and admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA received the transcript of\nthe hearing (Tr.) on August 14, 2008. I held the record open until August 21, 2008, for\nApplicant to submit additional matters.  On August 20, 2008, she submitted one\nadditional document, AE L, which is marked and admitted without objection. The record\nclosed on August 21, 2008.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nNotice\nAt the hearing, Applicant indicated she received the hearing notice on July 30,\n2008. (Tr. 8-9.) I advised Applicant of her right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15\ndays notice before the hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived her right to 15 days\nnotice. (Tr. 8-9.)\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated June 11, 2008, Applicant denied the factual\nallegations of the SOR.2\nApplicant, who is 52 years old, works as a business development director for a\nDepartment of Defense contractor. She has held this position for 19 months. Her\nemployer requested that she apply for a security clearance. Applicant held a Q level\nclearance with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) from 1980 until 1985 and a L\nor secret level clearance with the NRC from 2001 until 2003. Both clearances expired\nwhen her employment terminated. She followed all procedures for handling classified\ninformation during the times she held a clearance in the past.  \n3\nApplicant graduated from college in the 1970s with a bachelor\u2019s degree in health\nphysics. She received her master\u2019s degree in health physics in 1980. She started\nworking for the NRC in 1980. In 1985, she left the NRC for employment in the private\nsector, where she did not need a security clearance. In 1991, she started employment\n\nTr. 30-31.\n4\nGE 2 (Applicant\u2019s 2001 security clearance application); GE 3 (Resubmitted SF-86 dated December 31, 2002);\n5\nGE 5 (Closing transmittal for 2001 investigation); GE 6 (Closing transmittal for 2003 investigation); AE B\n(Letter, dated August 1, 2008) Tr. 35-50.\nAE A (Letter, dated July 31, 2008); Tr. 32, 74.\n6\nAE C (2004 football schedule); AE D (Letter, dated July 22, 2008); Tr. 32, 52.\n7\n3\nwith a national trade association. Ten years later, this employer promoted her to the\nDirector of Security and requested her to apply for a NRC clearance, which she did.4\nApplicant completed a SF-86 on April 13, 2001 for the NRC clearance. Following\nan investigation limited to a criminal background check and a credit check, the NRC\ngranted Applicant a L level clearance on August 18, 2001.  Sometime later, the NRC\nrealized that this investigation was in error. The NRC did not request Applicant to\ncomplete a new SF-86. Instead, someone with access to the 2001 SF-86, dated the SF-\n86 for December 31, 2002 and resubmitted paperwork for a more extensive background\ninvestigation. Applicant did not sign this SF-86. Applicant\u2019s already granted clearance\nremained in effect. When the background investigation concluded in April 2003, the\nNRC granted her L level clearance again. On May 15, 2003, she ended her employment\nwith the trade association. Her clearance terminated at the same time. Thereafter,\nApplicant worked in private industry until her current employment. 5\nSince graduating from college, Applicant and several college friends regularly\nvisit with each other at different places in the United States. In June 2003, one visit\noccurred at the home of a friend near Applicant\u2019s college. Friends of this friend attended\nthe gathering and brought with them marijuana. Applicant took one puff of the marijuana\ncigarette during this visit. She refused a second opportunity to take a puff on the\nmarijuana cigarette during this visit.6\nApplicant again used marijuana twice in November 2004 while watching a\nfootball game with her college friends. She has not used marijuana since this time. She\ntold her friend that if her friends who use marijuana attend any of the gatherings,\nApplicant will not attend. Applicant occasionally smoked marijuana during social events\nin college, but did not smoke marijuana after college until 2003. She denies any other\nmarijuana use.   \n7\nApplicant completed her current SF-86 in March 2007, one month after beginning\nher current employment. She answered \u201cyes\u201d to Question 24 a about her use of illegal\ncontrolled substances in the last seven years and stated that she used marijuana three\ntimes between January 2000 and January 2005. She estimated the time frame in which\nshe used the marijuana. At the hearing and after careful review of the circumstances of\nher use with friends, she narrowed these times frames to June 2003 and November\n2004. She answered \u201cno\u201d to Question 24 b about using illegal controlled substances\n\nGE 1, supra note 3, at 25; Tr. 57, 65 74-75. \n8\nGE 2, supra note 5, at 8; Tr. 61-65. \n9\nAE J (Statement of Intent); Tr. 57.\n10\nAE A, supra note 6, AE D, supra note 7; AE E (Letter, dated August 1, 2008); AE F (Letter, dated July 28,\n11\n2008); AE G (Letter, dated July 30, 2008); AE H (Letter, dated July 24, 2008).\nGE 1, supra note 3, at 12, 17-18.\n12\n4\nwhile employed as a law enforcement officer, prosecutor, or courtroom official, while\nholding a security clearance or in a public safety positions. 8\nIn her 2001 SF-86, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to Question 24 a, b, and c regarding\nher use of illegal controlled substances. She initially answered \u201cyes\u201d to question 24 a\nbecause she thought the question asked for any use of illegal controlled substances\nsince age 16 and she had used marijuana in college. She later reread the question and\nrealized it asked for her use in the last seven years, so she changed her answer to \u201cno\u201d\nas she had not used any illegal controlled substances since college, over 20 years\nearlier.9\nApplicant prepared and submitted a Statement of Intent at the hearing. She\nconsents to the revocation of her security clearance for any violations as described\nunder the Adjudicative Guideline H. She indicates an intent not to use marijuana or any\nother illegal substances in the future.10\nApplicant provided six letters of recommendation from friends, her supervisors,\nand her brother-in-law. All are aware of her drug involvement issue in her security\nclearance application. All describe her as trustworthy, honest and reliable. Her work\nethic is great and she is respected by her employers.11\nApplicant married 11 years ago. She has two step-sons, ages 21 and 17.12\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\n\n5\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline H, Drug Involvement\nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include:\n\n6\n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds\nidentified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of\n1970, \nas \namended \n(e.g., \nmarijuana \nor \ncannabis,\ndepressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and\n(2) inhalants and other similar substances;\n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a\nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction.\nIn this case, a security concern may arise under the following conditions set forth\nin AG \u00b6 25, which may disqualify Applicant for a clearance:\n(a) any drug abuse (see above definition); and\n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance.\nAfter she left her position with the trade association, Applicant used marijuana on\nthree occasions in June 2003 and November 2004. She voluntarily provided this\ninformation. At the time she used marijuana, she did not hold a security clearance. The\ngovernment has established its case under AG \u00b6 25 (a). \nAs the government has established its case, Applicant must show that she has\nmitigated the government\u2019s concerns. Under AG \u00b6 26, the following conditions could\nmitigate security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s drug use.:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt\non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\nand\n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;\n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and,\n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of\nclearance for any violation;\nApplicant self-reported her use of marijuana in 2003 and 2004. Her family and\nfriends are not users of marijuana so there is little likelihood that she will use marijuana\nwhen attending events with them. She has told one friend that if the individuals, who\nbrought marijuana to the June 2003 get together, attend future events, she will not\n\n7\ncome. She has also signed a letter of intent for an automatic revocation of her security\nclearance if she uses illegal drugs in the future. Applicant acknowledges that her\ndecision to use marijuana, even only three times on two dates, showed a serious lapse\nin judgment. She realizes that she made a mistake and will not use marijuana or any\nother illegal controlled substance in the future. Her drug involvement does not impact on\nher current reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment because she will not use illegal\ndrugs again. She has mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline H.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;\n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning\nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent\nmedical authority, or other official government representative; and\n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity. \nApplicant did not falsify her April 2001 and December 2002 SF-86 when she\nanswered \u201cno\u201d to Question 24 about her past drug involvement because she did not use\nmarijuana in the seven years prior to signing her 2001 SF-86 or the submission of the\n2002 SF-86. Rather, an individual at the NRC did. Thus, Applicant did not falsify her\nanswer. When she completed the 2001 SF-86, she correctly answered the question\nabout her past drug use. Her testimony that she had not used marijuana since college\nuntil 2003 is credible. The government has not established that Applicant falsified her\nSF-86. Guideline E is found in favor of Applicant.\n\n8\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. As a college student and graduate\nstudent, Applicant used marijuana socially. Subsequent to her graduation in 1980,\nApplicant ceased all use of marijuana until 2003. At this time, she used marijuana once,\na definite lapse in judgment.  She again used marijuana on two occasions during a\nweekend get together with old college friends in 2004. She acknowledges she made a\nmistake. She will no longer associate with the individuals who use marijuana and has\nabstained from smoking marijuana for nearly four years. She has agreed to the\nrevocation of her clearance if she becomes involved with marijuana in the future, an\nagreement which has serious consequences for her.\nApplicant twice held security clearances without any violations of security\nprocedures. She has never been involved in criminal conduct or other illegal activities.\nShe is a valuable employee, who works hard and is highly respected by her employers.\nFriends, family and supervisors consider her honest, trustworthy and reliable. She\nworks in the community and has raised two stepsons. She is an asset to her employer\nand her community. She has a stable family and work life. Her one marijuana use in\n2003 and two marijuana uses in 2004 cannot be a source of improper pressure or\nduress. Of course, the issue is whether her use of marijuana four to five years ago\nraises concerns about her fitness to hold a security clearance. In light of the compelling\nmitigating information, her use of marijuana is insufficient to raise security concerns.\n(See AG & 2(a)(1).)  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\n\n9\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from her past drug use and\npersonal conduct.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\n  \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns\nunder Guideline E on February 19, 2009 and an amended SOR detailing security\nconcerns under Guideline G on May 12, 2009. These actions were taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \nAugust 7, 2009\n\nGE 1; Tr. 19-20.\n1\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on February 26, 2009. He answered\nthe SOR in writing on March 11, 2009, and requested a hearing before an\nadministrative judge. DOHA received the request on March 13, 2009. Department\nCounsel was prepared to proceed on May 28, 2009, and I received the case\nassignment on May 31, 2009. DOHA received his response to the amended SOR on\nJune 2, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on June 3, 2009, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on June 23, 2009. The government offered five exhibits (GE) 1\nthrough 4, which were received and admitted into evidence without objection. Applicant\ntestified on his own behalf.

He also provided additional information to\nsupport his request for eligibility for a security clearance.  \nApplicant, who is 24 years old, works as an assistant project manager for a\nDepartment of Defense contractor. He began his employment with this employer about\na year ago.  \n1\nApplicant attended a community college for one year, then transferred to a four-\nyear college in his sophomore year. He graduated from this college with a Bachelor of\nScience degree in business management in May 2008. During his years in college, he\nplayed on his school\u2019s hockey team. He now participates in an adult hockey league one\n\nId.\n2\nGE 4; Tr. 25-26, 35-37, 43-44.\n3\nGE 4; Tr. 46-47.\n4\nSince his college dropped the second strike, his third strike became a second strike.\n5\n3\nnight a week. He received a level three coaching certificate in hockey, which qualified\nhim to coach hockey.2\nAfter transferring to the four-year college, Applicant started consuming alcohol\nsocially. He drank alcohol regularly and, at times, to excess. He usually became\nintoxicated when he drank, often three times a week. In the fall 2005, Applicant and\nfriends played an alcohol drinking game in the dorm room of one friend.  They became\nloud and noisy. The resident aide for the dorm cited (known as a strike) all but one\nindividual in the room for unauthorized activity, drinking alcohol. As a result of this\ncitation, Applicant paid a $150 fine and attended a mandatory alcohol awareness\nprogram developed and operated by his college. He compared the program to driving\nclasses, only about alcohol. The program lasted six hours and included slides, videos,\nand other information which made him aware of the effects of alcohol on him, but\nreceived no one-on-one counseling. He did not recall completing any forms or\npaperwork about himself when he participated in this program. He did not consider this\nprogram counseling.3\nIn early 2006, several of Applicant\u2019s friends came to his room. Two 21-year-old\nfriends brought alcohol with them. The group ordered pizza and Applicant left the room\nto pick up the pizza. While he was gone, the 21-year-old friends started drinking beer.\nWhen Applicant returned to his room, two resident aides stood by his room door and\nadvised the campus police had been called. The school, not the police, charged\neveryone in the room with possession of alcohol and alcohol use. All appealed the\ncharges, or \u201cstrike\u201d, which were dropped. He had not consumed any alcohol in this\nincident.   \n4\nOn January 13, 2006, the night before a hockey game or a travel day to a hockey\ngame, Applicant and his hockey teammates met to play cards. During the evening,\nApplicant consumed two beers. A female friend called him and asked him to walk her\nhome. When she arrived at the card game, he realized she was very intoxicated.  He\nproceeded to walk her home. While walking, she tripped and fell in front of a city police\nofficer. The police officer conducted a breathalyzer test on both of them. Applicant\u2019s test\nresults showed a .06, which resulted in a charge of underage possession of alcohol for\nhim. The police officer took the female friend to jail. The underage charge resulted in a\nthird \u201cstrike\u201d under school policy.  The school required him to participate in a school-\n5\nsponsored alcohol counseling program. Applicant completed forms about his alcohol\nuse for this program. He participated in one-on-one counseling session with an intern.\nHe attended two to four sessions, which he finished prior to completing his security\nclearance application. In his statement to the security investigator, he opined that this\n\nGE 4; Tr. 26-29, 42, 44.\n6\nGE 4; AE A; AE B; Tr. 29-32.\n7\nTr. 39, 44-45.\n8\n4\nprogram was not an alcohol treatment program. At the hearing, he acknowledged that\nthe second college program was an alcohol counseling program.6\nApplicant appeared in state court on the above charge. The prosecution gave\nhim the option of appearing before a judge or attending the state\u2019s alcohol safety action\nprogram (ASAP), paying a $65 fine, and having the charges removed. Applicant chose\nthe second option. He completed the paperwork to attend ASAP; however, he did not\nreceive the notice showing when and where his class would be held until after the class\nhad concluded. He rescheduled the ASAP classes and completed the classes as\nrequired in the early spring of 2007. He did not consider this program alcohol counseling\nor treatment. The court docket sheet and record showed that on February 27, 2006, the\ncourt took his case under advisement for 12 months, and if there were no violations, the\ncase would be dismissed. On May 17, 2007, the court ordered the charge dismissed.\nThe court entered no other orders in this case.7\nApplicant acknowledged that he twice drove a car when alcohol impaired. By his\nsenior year of college, he began to slowly reduce his consumption. During the summer\nof 2008, Applicant and friends spent casual time together, which included drinking. Now\nthat he works full-time, Applicant drinks far less than he did in college. He drinks one or\ntwo beers on the weekend or one drink with dinner in the company of his girlfriend or\nwith his father. He spends less time with his friends and drinking, although he still drinks\nsocially. He gets drunk maybe once a month. Applicant has never been told he suffered\nfrom alcohol abuse and the record contains no evidence which reflects such a diagnosis\nby a professional.8\nWhen he completed the e-QIP on July 26, 2006, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to the\nfollowing questions:\nSection 24. Your Use of Illegal Drugs and Drug Activity\na.\nSince the age of 16 or in the last 7 years, whichever is\nshorter, have you illegally used any controlled substance, for\nexample, marijuana, cocaine, crack cocaine, hashish,\nnarcotics \n(Opium \nmorphine, \ncodeine, \nheroin, \netc.).\namphetamines, depressants (barbiturates, methaqualone,\ntranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.) or\nprescription drugs?;\nb.\nHave you ever illegally used a controlled substance while\nemployed as a law enforcement officer, prosecutor, or\n\nTr. 21-24, 51.\n9\nGE 3; Tr. 25-26, 29-30, 43-44.\n10\n5\ncourtroom official; while possessing a security clearance; or\nwhile in a position directly or immediately affecting public\nsafety?; and\nc.\nIn the last 7 years, have you been involved in the illegal\npurchase, manufacture, trafficking, production, transfer,\nshipping, receiving, or sale of any narcotic, depressant,\nstimulant, hallucinogen or cannabis for you own intended\nprofit or that of another?\nand\nSection 25. Your Use of Alcohol\nIn the last 7 years, has your use of alcoholic beverages\n(such as liquor, beer, wine) resulted in any alcohol-related\ntreatment or counseling (such as for alcohol abuse or\nalcoholism)?\nApplicant used marijuana on a few occasions in college. He last used marijuana\non January 1, 2006. He does not intend to smoke marijuana ever again in the future. He\nalso used Adderall, a prescription drug of a friend, on two separate occasions while\nstudying for exams as a college student. He last used Adderall in 2007. He did not list\nhis marijuana use on his e-QIP because his father reviewed his e-QIP and he did not\nwant his father to learn about his use. When he met with the security investigator in\nNovember 2006, the investigator reviewed the e-QIP questions with him. During the\ncourse of the interview, the security investigator provided no indication of any\nknowledge of drug use by Applicant. Applicant provided information on his drug use\nwhen they discussed question 24. His parents know about his Adderall use, but not his\nmarijuana use.9\nConcerning his failure to list alcohol treatment, Applicant did not consider the\nASAP class or the first class he took at college as alcohol counseling or treatment\nprograms. Rather, he viewed both programs as alcohol awareness programs. He could\nnot provide an explanation for why he did not acknowledge the second college alcohol\nawareness program as a treatment program. He did acknowledge treatment in his\nanswers to interrogatories. His parents know about the alcohol counseling.10\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\n\n6\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133\n11\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\n7\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of\nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security\nclearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nFor AG \u00b6 16(a) to apply, Applicant\u2019s omission must be deliberate. The\ngovernment established that Applicant omitted a material fact from his e-QIP when he\nanswered \u201cno\u201d to the questions about his past drug use and alcohol counseling. This\ninformation is material to the evaluation of Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness to hold a security\nclearance and to his honesty. In his response and at the hearing, Applicant denies,\nhowever, that he had an intent to hide information about his drug use from the\ngovernment. He could provide no explanation for the omission of information about his\ndrug counseling. When a falsification allegation is controverted, the government has the\nburden of proving the omission was deliberate. Proof of an omission, standing alone,\ndoes not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission\noccurred. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to\ndetermine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s\nintent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred.  For DC \u00b6 16(a) to apply, the\n11\ngovernment must establish that Applicant\u2019s omission, concealment or falsification in his\nanswer was deliberate.\nAt the time he completed his e-QIP, Applicant knew he had used marijuana and\nAdderall in college. The government has established that Applicant intentionally hid his\nmarijuana use at the time he completed his security clearance application. The\ndisqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 16(a)  applies to SOR allegation 1.a.\nConcerning SOR allegation 1.b, Applicant indicated in his 2006 interview that he\ndid not perceive the second college alcohol program as an alcohol treatment. He knew\nhis college required that he participate in this program because he had been cited a\nsecond time for an alcohol-related incident at school. Given his perception of the\nsecond program in 2006, Applicant did not intentionally hide this information from the\n\nEven if I found the government established this allegation, I would find  the information was unsubstantiated\n12\nunder AG \u00b6 20 (f).\n8\ngovernment when he completed his e-QIP. Thus, the government has not established\nintentional falsification for this allegation. Allegation 1.b is found in favor of Applicant.12\nSOR allegation 1.c fails to allege any personal conduct issue under Guideline E.\nThe court docket sheet and record does not indicate that the court ordered Applicant to\nattend ASAP. Rather, the court took the case under advisement in February 2006 and\n15 months later, entered the only order of record, a dismissal of the charge against\nApplicant. Allegation 1.c is found in favor of Applicant.\nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 and conclude\nthat the following mitigating conditions are raised in this case:\n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.\nApplicant clearly did not provide information about his marijuana and Adderall\nuse when he completed his e-QIP. He intended to hide his marijuana use from his\nfather, who reviewed his application. When he met with the security investigator, he\nprovided this information when they discussed the question about drug use. Without\nApplicant providing this information, the security investigator had no way to know he\nused illegal drugs in college. Applicant had never been arrested either at school or as a\ncitizen for possession of drugs or drug paraphernalia, and the record contained no\ninformation from witnesses which indicated drug use. Applicant has not used marijuana\nin more than three years and Adderall in more than two year. He does not intend to use\neither in the future. He has changed both his attitude and behavior towards marijuana\nand Adderall. Applicant\u2019s decision not to provide information on his security clearance\napplication about his past drug use occurred for a unique reason and does not cast\ndoubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Based on this information, I\nfind that Applicant has mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline E.\n\n9\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption,\n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or\nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability\nand trustworthiness.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under\nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or\nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is\ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; and\n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol\nabuser or alcohol dependent.\nWhen he entered college, Applicant began drinking alcohol as part of his social\nlife. He consumed alcohol to excess and his consumption led to impairment on a regular\nbasis. His alcohol consumption resulted in two citations or strikes by his college for\npossession of alcohol or drinking on campus. The police cited him on one occasion for\npossession of alcohol as a minor. He also acknowledged driving a car on two occasions\nwhile intoxicated. The police did not stop or arrest him on either occasion. The\ngovernment has established its case under AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and 22(c).\nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment.\nApplicant\u2019s only incident with police occurred in February 2006, more than three\nyears ago. Likewise, the college last cited him in 2006 for alcohol-related behavior,\nagain more than three years ago. Applicant\u2019s excessive alcohol use occurred while a\ncollege student. He has not been diagnosed as either an alcohol abuser or as alcohol\ndependent. \nApplicant continues to drink, but in moderation. He has significantly reduced his\nalcohol consumption and the frequency of alcohol impairment. His life focuses on\nhockey, his career, his family, and his girlfriend. Alcohol does not have the same role in\nhis life as it did when he was a college student. His alcohol use and conduct as a\ncollege student does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\n\n10\njudgment. Applicant has mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns under Guideline\nG.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or deny a security\nclearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both favorable and\nunfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the evidence of record,\nnot a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is established and then\nwhether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security\nclearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct, but on a\nreasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a nexus\nexists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is more substantial. In\nreaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case as well as all\nthe evidence of record. As a college student, Applicant started consuming alcohol\nsocially. His alcohol consumption became excessive, often resulting in impairment and\nled to three citations during his first year at his four-year college. After this year, he\nreceived no additional school citations, although he continued to consume excessive\namounts of alcohol. As he matured, he realized in his senior year of college that he\nneeded to change his drinking habits. Since graduation and career developing\nemployment, he changed both his attitude and behavior towards alcohol. He still drinks,\nbut at a much reduced level. His current drinking patterns show generally responsible\ndrinking and are not a security concern. He focuses on his job, hockey, coaching, and\nfamily, not getting drunk on a regular basis.\nApplicant purposefully did not reveal his marijuana use on his e-QIP because he\nwas scared to reveal this conduct to his father, not because he wanted to hide the\n\n11\ninformation from the government. He provided the information to the investigator during\nhis interview, when his father was not present. His fear about his father learning of this\npast conduct is not enough to raise a security concern because others know about the\nconduct and there is little likelihood that he could be pressured, coerced, or exploited to\nreveal protected information. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his personal conduct\nand alcohol consumption.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline G:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all three of the allegations in his answer to the SOR, and offered explanations. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is 51 years old. He has been an employee of a defense contractor since May 2007 working as a senior software engineer. He was unemployed for six months before obtaining his present job. He holds a B.S. degree in electrical engineering from a prominent engineering school on the east coast. He has never been married. Applicant admitted use of marijuana with varying frequency for 30 years from 1977 when he was a sophomore in college until March 2007 when he was employed in his present position. He stopped using marijuana when he was preparing to file an application for a security clearance. He also has purchased marijuana at various times during his use. His use of marijuana declined after 1987 to once a month on weekends or when attending concerts (Exh. 6). All of the evidence proving the allegations was provided by Applicant in his interrogatory in an effort to be forthcoming in connection with his SF 86. Applicant is pleased that he no longer uses marijuana and has had no difficulty in ceasing its use. He has no intention of using the drug in the future and it has had no impact on his work or health.

Clearance \nis denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn June 6, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires For \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) also known as Security Clearance Application (SF \n86). On March 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and \nmodified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, \nmodified and revised.

Documents were attached to the answer with explanatory information. A \ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated May 1, 2008, was provided \nto him, and he was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation.

The case was assigned to me on June 16, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all three of the allegations in his answer to the SOR, and \noffered explanations. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I \nmake the following findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is 51 years old. He has been an employee of a defense contractor \nsince May 2007 working as a senior software engineer. He was unemployed for six \nmonths before obtaining his present job. He holds a B.S. degree in electrical \nengineering from a prominent engineering school on the east coast.

He stopped using marijuana when he was preparing to file an \napplication for a security clearance. He also has purchased marijuana at various times \nduring his use. His use of marijuana declined after 1987 to once a month on weekends \nor when attending concerts (Exh. 6). All of the evidence proving the allegations was \nprovided by Applicant in his interrogatory in an effort to be forthcoming in connection \nwith his SF 86.  \n \n \nApplicant is pleased that he no longer uses marijuana and has had no difficulty in \nceasing its use. He has no intention of using the drug in the future and it has had no \nimpact on his work or health. He still associates with the friends with whom he used \nmarijuana, but only one of them continues to use it. His family and co-workers are \naware of his past use. \n  \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered For access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude that the following Adjudicative Guidelines provide the standard for \nresolution of the allegations set forth in the SOR.  \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and \ninclude: \n \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and \nlisted in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., \nmarijuana \nor \ncannabis, \ndepressants, \nnarcotics, \nstimulants, \nand \nhallucinogens). \n \n (b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a \nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes several conditions that could be applicable to this matter, raise \na security concern, and may be disqualifying: \n \n(a) any drug abuse (see above definition);  \n \n(b) testing positive for illegal drug use; \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of drug abuse or drug dependence; \n \n(e) evaluation of drug abuse or drug dependence by a licensed clinical \nsocial worker who, is a staff member of a recognized drug treatment \nprogram; \n \n(f) failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program prescribed by \na duly qualified medical professional; \n \n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance; and, \n \n(h) expressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and \nconvincingly commit to discontinue drug use.  \n \n \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and, \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of   \nclearance for any violation; \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand, \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \nWhile Applicant provided candid responses in his answer and to the \ninterrogatories, his admission of regular drug use over such an extended period of time \nraises serious questions as to his judgment. The period of time of abstention is \ninsufficient to justify application of the abstinence criteria.  While he continues contacts \nwith his friends with whom he used marijuana, only one continues to use it. This is \nproblematic as to whether this condition provides mitigation. Other MCs are \ninapplicable. He continued to use marijuana for thirty years into adulthood and well after \ncompleting college. There is insufficient evidence of rehabilitation to apply the mitigating \nconditions. It is premature to grant a security clearance  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the disqualifying \nconditions previously discussed through application of the whole person concept. After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to drug allegations. He has made some progress in \nchanging his conduct, but the conduct alleged occurred well into adulthood so it cannot \nbe attributed to youthful indiscretions.  He has been totally abstinent for only 16 months.  \n \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), a careful consideration of the whole person factors and supporting \nevidence, application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative process, and \ninterpretation of my responsibilities under the guidelines. Applicant has not mitigated or \novercome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible \nfor access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or For Applicant on the allegations set Forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:  \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n Subparagraph 1.a.:  Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b.:  Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c.:  Against Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      Conclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n___________________ \nCharles D. Ablard \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On November 4, 2008, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant\nof the basis for that decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and\n\n2\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On April 23, 2009 after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Rita C. O\u2019Brien denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issues on appeal: (a) whether the Judge failed to properly\nconsider various matters in mitigation in the case; and (b) whether the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant\nfalsified an answer on a security clearance application is sustainable.  For the following reasons, the\nBoard affirms the Judge\u2019s adverse security clearance decision. \nThe Judge found, inter alia, that Applicant, after he graduated from college, used marijuana\nfive times between 1999 and 2005, used psychedelic mushrooms in 2001 or 2002, and used anabolic\nsteroids from March to June 2005, December 2005 to February 2006, and October to December\n2006.  Applicant had held a security clearance since 2001.  When filling out a security clearance\napplication in April 2007, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to a question asking whether he had ever been\nterminated from a job for cause, or otherwise left a job under unfavorable circumstances.  The Judge\nfound that in 2000, Applicant was informed by his employer that he \u201cwas not working out\u201d and that\nhe would be leaving the company.  The Judge also found that Applicant was unhappy with his work\nsituation and that he \u201cwelcomed\u201d leaving the company.\nThe Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use was not mitigated.  The Judge\nspecifically mentioned  Applicant\u2019s willingness to engage repeatedly in illegal drug use while he was\na mature adult and while he held a security clearance.  The Judge concluded that Applicant had\nengaged in deliberate falsification when he did not reveal the circumstances of his termination from\nemployment in 2000.  The Judge concluded the falsification was unmitigated.  \nApplicant asserts that the Judge did not consider important matters in mitigation under\nGuideline H.  There is a rebuttable presumption that the Judge considered all the record evidence in\na case unless he or she specifically states otherwise.  A review of the Judge\u2019s decision convinces the\nBoard that Applicant has not overcome this presumption.  The presence of some mitigating evidence\ndoes not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision.  As the trier of fact,\nthe Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs\nthe unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 06-10320 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 7,\n2007).  A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for\na different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).  \nIn this case, the Judge weighed the mitigating evidence offered by Applicant against the\nseriousness of the disqualifying conduct under Guideline H and considered the possible application\nof relevant conditions and factors.  However, the Judge concluded that there was insufficient\nevidence to mitigate the Guideline H allegations.  This conclusion is reasonably supported by the\nrecord.  The fact that the Judge did not specifically mention portions of evidence that Applicant\nconsiders mitigating, including Applicant\u2019s willingness to sign an agreement not to use drugs in the\n\n3\nfuture and Applicant\u2019s statement that his security clearance and his career are very important to him,\ndoes not establish error.  \nRegarding the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant engaged in a deliberate falsification when\nhe failed to reveal the circumstances involved in the termination of his employment in 2000, that\nconclusion is sustainable on this record.  Applicant revealed the pertinent information about the job\ntermination when responding to a set of interrogatory questions subsequent to his completion of the\nsecurity clearance application.  The Judge correctly noted that the interrogatory question was the\nsame question as the one on the security clearance application and reasonably concluded that the\nexplanation Applicant provided on the interrogatory question could easily have been provided on\nthe security clearance application.  The record evidence indicates that the circumstances surrounding\nApplicant\u2019s termination of employment in 2000 were of such a nature that they were reasonably\ncontemplated by the question on the security clearance application.  Applicant\u2019s ability to provide\nan explanation for his failure to answer the application question affirmatively does not render the\nJudge\u2019s contrary conclusion arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  \nOrder\nThe decision of the Judge denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D.

Accordingly, his request for a \nsecurity clearance is denied. \n \n \nApplicant requested a security clearance by submitting an Electronic \nQuestionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) on April 12, 2007. After reviewing \nthe results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office \n \n1\nApril 23, 2009\n\n \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary affirmative finding1 \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s request.  \n \nOn November 4, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), \nwhich specified the basis for its decision \u2013 security concerns addressed in the Directive \nunder Guidelines H (Drug Involvement) and E (Personal Conduct) of the Revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).2 \n \nApplicant signed his notarized Answer on December 5, 2008, in which he \nadmitted to allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.c. under Guideline H. Under Guideline E, he \nadmitted to SOR \u00b6 2.a, which cross-references allegations 1.a. through 1.c. He denied \nallegations 2.b. and 2.c., which allege deliberate falsification of information he provided \non his security clearance application. Applicant also requested a hearing before an \nadministrative judge. \n \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on December 29, 2008, and the \ncase was assigned to me on the following day. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on \nJanuary 9, 2009. However, on January 30, 2009, Applicant's counsel requested a \ncontinuance, and Department Counsel did not object. I granted the request by Order \ndated February 2, 2009. An Amended Notice of Hearing was issued on February 3, \n2009, re-setting the hearing for February 25, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nDuring the hearing, the government offered eight exhibits, marked as Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 8, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on \nhis own behalf and did not offer exhibits. DOHA received the transcript on March 3, \n2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in response to the SOR are admitted as fact.

In 2007, he submitted an application for a higher level clearance (Tr 24; 98). \n \nApplicant was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Disorder at the age of 12 and \nremains on medication for that illness. Since 2001, he also has been treated for anxiety \nand depression, and currently takes medication for those conditions. He also takes \nmedication for high blood pressure and high cholesterol (GE 3; Tr 37; 93-94). \n \nAlthough many of his friends used illegal drugs during college, Applicant did not. \nHowever, after college, he used marijuana five times between 1999 and 2005. He first \nused it in 1999, with his former college roommates. He was willing to try it because he \ntrusted them to help him if anything went wrong while he used the drug. He also used it \nwith his cousin in August 2004; in summer 2005 with his partner and his partner\u2019s friend; \na fourth time with his partner and a friend in October 2005; and a fifth time at a party he \nand his partner gave on New Year\u2019s Eve, 2005 (GE 3; Tr 35-36). Applicant used the drug \nin response to pressure from his partner and his friends, and because of his desire to \nfeel like part of the group (Tr 85). In response to his statement that marijuana did not \nhave much of an effect on him (Tr 84), he was asked, \n \nMr. Jaksetic: Then why did you use it on a variety of occasions \nover several years? \n \nApplicant: It was totally peer pressure. In that, not one instance did \nI ever use it alone. I was surrounded by people I trusted. They \nwere doing it, so I, you know, had to feel part of the group and \nthat\u2019s you know, what I, what I did. \n \n At the time he used marijuana, between 1999 and 2005, Applicant was 24 to 30 \nyears old, and held a security clearance (Tr 74).3 He was aware that marijuana use was \nillegal (Tr 31; 83). He no longer associates with his cousin or the friends with whom he \nused marijuana. He is no longer in a relationship with the partner with whom he used \nmarijuana and steroids (Tr 38). \n \nIn approximately 2001 or 2002, Applicant used psychedelic mushrooms. He was \nwith close friends whom he trusted. He testified that he accepted tea that they had \nprepared, and after he drank it, they informed him that it was made from psychedelic \nmushrooms (Tr 40; 83-84). However, during his Subject Interview, he stated that he \ndrank the tea because of peer pressure (GE 3). Applicant reviewed the Interrogatories \nthat contain the report of his Subject Interview (GE 3). He made numerous hand-written \ncorrections to the report to be sure that \u201c\u2026whoever reads them understand (sic) exactly \n                                                 \n3 Applicant testified that during three of the five times he used marijuana he held an active security \nclearance (Tr 99). However, according to the dates he provided in GE 3, he used marijuana a total of four \ntimes between 2004 and 2005, all of which occurred after he received a final secret clearance in 2001 (Tr \n24). \n \n3\n\n \nwhat, you know, what was going on with me, and so, you know, so there was no, you \nknow, questions about anything.\u201d (Tr 44). He made no corrections to the section where \nhe stated that he drank the tea as a result of peer pressure. As he corrected other \nsections that he believed to be wrong, but left that statement uncorrected, I find that \nApplicant was aware that he was accepting a drink made from an illegal drug, and drank \nit anyway because of pressure from his friends to do so. He has not used mushrooms \nsince that time (Tr 40-41; 72-73). He no longer associates with the friends with whom he \nused psychedelic mushrooms (Tr 71-72). \n \nIn about the summer of 2005, Applicant and his partner decided that they would \ntry anabolic steroids. Applicant agreed to use steroids because he wished to improve his \nlooks by increasing his muscle size. He also felt pressure from friends, and especially \nfrom his partner, to use the drug (Tr 94-96). By pooling their money, he and his partner \nwere able to afford the drug, and bought it on the internet. Each course of steroids \nrequired a once-per-week injection for about three months (Tr 29-30). He and his partner \ninjected each other, on a weekend or on a Monday morning before work. Applicant took \nthree separate courses of steroids: March to June 2005; December 2005 to February \n2006; and October to December 2006. Each course involved 12 shots, for a total of 36 \ninjections (GE 3; Tr 74). The drug increased his muscle size, but also had negative side \neffects. Applicant discontinued use because he did not look well, the drug could \nnegatively affect his blood pressure and cholesterol, and it interfered with his prescription \nmedications (GE 2; Tr 93-94). Applicant testified that he was aware that using illegal \ndrugs was inconsistent with holding a security clearance (Tr 75), but also stated that \nwhen he used steroids, he did not think about the fact that he was holding a security \nclearance (Tr 97). When he used anabolic steroids, Applicant was aware it was illegal to \nuse them without a prescription (Tr 83; 93-94). He is no longer with the partner with \nwhom he used anabolic steroids (Tr 38). \n \nWhen Applicant completed his Security Clearance Application on April 12, 2007, \nhe answered question 24.a. concerning drug use, by stating that he used anabolic \nsteroids three times between March 2005 and December 2006. In response to question \n22, he did not disclose a job termination (GE 1). The government alleges that he \ndeliberately falsified his answers to both questions.  \n \nWhen describing his anabolic steroid use, Applicant stated that he used the drug \nthree times because he considered each course of steroids as one use. He described his \nanswer as similar to the way a course of antibiotics would be described (Tr 46), where a \nperson would mention having taken a certain antibiotic once, even though he or she \ningested medication several times a day for 10 days. At his subject interview in May \n2007, Applicant explained he used anabolic steroids once a week for twelve weeks, \nduring three separate courses, or 36 total injections (GE 3).  \n \nApplicant answered No to question 22 on his security clearance application. The \nquestion asked whether or not he had left employment for any of the following reasons: \nterminated for cause; quit to avoid termination for cause; left by agreement following \n \n4\n\n \nallegations of misconduct or unsatisfactory performance; or left under any other type of \nunfavorable circumstance (GE 1). Applicant was employed by a company as an \nassociate project manager from January to November 2000. Approximately 11 months \nafter he started, his employer informed him that he \u201cwas not working out\u201d and that he \nwould be leaving the company (Tr 54). He was not accused of misconduct (Tr 57). He \ntestified there was no \u201cmutual agreement\u201d to leave the job, because he did not want to \nleave it (Tr 57). However, Applicant also testified, and explained in his Interrogatory \nresponse (GE 4), that he was unhappy because his assignments were not what he had \nbeen promised (Tr 53), that he felt underutilized and marginalized, that he did not agree \nwith his supervisor\u2019s approach to tasks (Tr 59-60), and that he \u201cwelcomed\u201d leaving the \ncompany (Tr 60). Applicant testified that the company was unhappy with his performance \n(Tr 82): \n \nMr. Jaksetic: Would it be fair to say, basically from your testimony as I \nunderstand it and your answer to the interrogatories, they weren\u2019t happy \nwith your performance and you weren\u2019t happy with the situation, correct? \n \nApplicant: Yes. \n \n \nApplicant believes that he was not fired, but laid off, because he received \nunemployment compensation after he left. He testified that he was required to answer \neither \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d on his security clearance application, and because none of the \nchoices described his situation; he answered \u201cNo\u201d without further explanation. When he \ncompleted the Interrogatory response in July 2008, he was not required to answer \u201cYes\u201d \nor \u201cNo,\u201d so he selected the option that came closest to describing his situation -- \u201cLeft a \njob by mutual agreement following allegations of unsatisfactory performance\u201d -- and then \nwrote an explanation of the circumstances (all facts from GE 3 and Tr 53-60). \n \nApplicant's Answer to the SOR contained several attachments. A 2002 \nperformance evaluation rated him as a \u201cSuccessful Contributor\u201d and included a letter \nfrom his program manager describing Applicant as an energetic team member who has \nbeen assigned increasingly difficult tasks. A letter from one co-worker described him as \nintelligent, and a skillful project manager, with excellent communication skills. Two other \nco-workers described him as an honest, trustworthy, and professional employee who \nabides by program and company policies.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and common-sense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).4 Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \u201cwhole \n                                                 \n3 Directive. 6.3. \n \n5\n\n \nperson\u201d factors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines. \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties \nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under \nGuideline H (Drug Involvement) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).   \n \n \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve the questions of \nwhether it is clearly consistent with the national interest5 for an Applicant to either \nreceive or continue to have access to classified information. The government bears the \ninitial burden of producing admissible information on which it based the preliminary \ndecision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an Applicant. Additionally, the \ngovernment must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the \ngovernment meets its burden, it then falls to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate \nthe government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an \nApplicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.6 A person who has access to classified \ninformation enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and \nconfidence. Therefore, the government has a compelling interest in ensuring each \nApplicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who \nwill protect the national interests as his or his own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the \nnational interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an \nApplicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.7 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \nreliability \nand \ntrustworthiness both because it may impair judgment and \nbecause it raises questions about a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n                                                 \n4 See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988). \n5 See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531. \n6 See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b). \n \n6\n\n \nThe facts raise two disqualifying conditions: AG \u00b6 25(a) (any drug abuse) and AG \n\u00b6 25(g) (any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance). Applicant admits \nto using three illegal substances: marijuana, psychedelic mushrooms, and anabolic \nsteroids. Applicant was granted his security clearance in 1998 and admits that he used \nillegal drugs while he held a clearance. Both conditions apply. \n \nGuideline H also includes two relevant mitigating conditions. The first, AG \u00b6 26(a) \n(the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), cannot be applied. Applicant\u2019s last \nuse of anabolic steroids was in December 2006, a little more than two years ago, which \nis not distant in time. He used the illegal drug weekly for three-months at a time, \nrepeating the process three times over an extended period of more than one-and-one-\nhalf years. His use of illegal drugs did not occur under unique circumstances, but with \nfriends, partners, and at social gatherings. In addition, he used illegal drugs because he \nfelt pressured by friends and/or his partner. His repeated acquiescence to such \npressure indicates a willingness to follow others, even when it leads to actions that are \nagainst the law. His conduct raises doubts about his good judgment and reliability and \nhis ability to follow rules and regulations. His illegal drug use, while holding a security \nclearance, is not mitigated.  \n \n \nMitigating condition AG \u00b6 26(b) is also relevant: \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and, \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation. \n \nPartial mitigation is available under AG \u00b6 26(b)(1) and (b)(3). It appears from the record \nthat Applicant has not used illegal drugs since December 2006, and that he does not \nassociate with the people with whom he used drugs in the past. In particular, he is no \nlonger in a relationship with the partner with whom he used both marijuana and anabolic \nsteroids. Although these factors weigh in Applicant's favor, they must be viewed in light \nof the period of time during which he willingly engaged in illegal drug use: intermittent \nuse of marijuana over a six-year period, and repeated courses of illegal drugs over a \nperiod of almost two years. In 2005 alone, he used marijuana three times and received \napproximately 12 illegal injections of steroids. Each time he used marijuana or received \nan injection, Applicant made a decision to engage in an illegal activity. Each decision \nwas made while he was a mature adult. And each decision was made while he held a \n \n7\n\n \n \n8\nsecurity clearance. His willingness to engage repeatedly in illegal activity raises doubts \nabout his ability to avoid illegal drugs in the future. Overall, AG \u00b6 26(b)(1) and (b)(3) are \ninsufficient to mitigate Applicant\u2019s disqualifying conduct. I find against Applicant on \nGuideline H. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern about personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of \nspecial interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid \nanswers during the security clearance process or any other failure \nto cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nApplicant's illegal drug use is cross-alleged under Guideline E of the SOR. His \nrepeated use of illegal drugs raises serious questions about his judgment, \ntrustworthiness and willingness to comply with rules and regulations. However, these \nsame qualities are at issue under Guideline H. As these issues are more appropriately \nconsidered under that Guideline, i will not separately address Applicant's illegal drug \nuse under Guideline E. \n \nThe government also alleges under Guideline E that Applicant deliberately \nfalsified answers he provided to two questions on his security clearance application. \nThe first falsification alleged is his disclosure of three uses of anabolic steroids; the \ngovernment contends that Applicant deliberately misrepresented the extent of his \nanabolic steroid use, because he should have listed 36 uses. The government also \nalleges that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose the circumstances under which he \nleft a previous employer. The allegations implicate AG \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, \npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities).  \n \nApplication of AG \u00b6 16(a) requires deliberate falsification. Applicant\u2019s failure to list \neach individual injection of anabolic steroids was not intentional. His disclosure of \nserious negative information \u2013 his marijuana, psychedelic mushroom, and anabolic \nsteroid use \u2013 shows that he did not intend to hide relevant information from the \ngovernment. His disclosure put the government on notice that drug use was an issue \nthat required further investigation, and it was explored in a Subject Interview one month \nafter he submitted his application. Although the difference between three uses and 36 \nuses is substantial, his disclosure of three uses was reasonable in light of his \n\n \n \n9\ninterpretation of his three courses of drug use. I conclude that Applicant did not \ndeliberately falsify his response about the extent of his drug use. \n \nHowever, the situation is not the same as to Applicant's failure to inform the \ngovernment about the circumstances under which he left his employment in 2000. He \ntestified that none of the choices provided in the security clearance application \ndescribed the circumstances under which he left his job. Yet when he later responded \nto the government\u2019s Interrogatories (GE 4), Applicant was provided with the same \nquestion and the same choices that were available to him on the security clearance \napplication. When he completed the Interrogatory response, he selected one choice, \nand wrote an explanation. He could have responded in this manner when he \ncompleted his application, because it allows for an explanation, both under the specific \nquestion, and at the end of the application under \u201cAdditional Comments.\u201d I conclude \nthat Applicant deliberately failed to inform the government about his termination, and \ndisqualifying condition AG \u00b6 16 (a) applies. \n \n \nGuideline E contains factors that can mitigate disqualifying conditions. The \nfollowing conditions are relevant: \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts); \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment); \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d) (the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate \nthe \nstressors, \ncircumstances, \nor \nfactors \nthat \ncaused \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur). \n \nApplicant's falsification about his job termination is unmitigated. Falsification of \ninformation provided to the government is not minor, and the record contains no \nevidence that he sought to correct the falsification. Such conduct reflects negatively on \nhis trustworthiness and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a) and 17(c) do not apply.   \n \nWhole Person Analysis   \n  \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the \nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and \nall the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n\n \n \n10\n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security \nclearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Under each guideline, I \nconsidered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts \nand circumstances surrounding this case.  \n \n \nApplicant decided to engage in serious, criminal conduct by using illegal drugs \nnumerous times over the years between 1999 and 2006. His last use was a little more \nthan two years ago, when he was a mature adult of 31 years. Applicant's recent \nabstinence is insufficient to overcome his history of drug use. Most troubling is the \nrefrain that repeats in all his explanations for using drugs: he succumbed to peer \npressure. Applicant repeatedly followed what others suggested, even though he was \nan adult, and even though they encouraged him to violate the law. His conduct \ndemonstrates a willingness to place his own desire to fit in above the government\u2019s \nneed for trustworthiness in those to whom it grants access to classified information. \nThat Applicant used illegal drugs while he held a security clearance, and did not even \nconsider, at the time, the fact that he held a clearance, underscores that he does not \nunderstand the nature of this obligation. Those who hold security clearances enter into \na fiduciary relationship based on trust. The government cannot place its confidence in \nthose who unthinkingly violate that trust. \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence fails to satisfy the doubts raised about Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the security concerns arising from the cited adjudicative guidelines. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. \u2013 1.c.  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n \n11\n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to allow Applicant access to \nclassified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 48 years old. He graduated from college in 1982 with a degree in mathematics. His professional experience since about 1994 has been in the information technology (IT) sector as a Unix administrator. Since November 2005, he has been 5 employed as such by a defense contractor that is sponsoring his clearance request. (Gx. 1) The government alleged in the SOR that Applicant was arrested for, charged with and convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) on December 16, 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and on July 31, 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). As part of the sentence for his 2004 DUI, Applicant was also alleged to have received alcohol counseling in 2007, which resulted in a diagnosis of alcohol dependence. (SOR \u00b6 1.c) The government further alleged Applicant first consumed alcohol at age 18 and still consumes alcohol. (SOR \u00b6 1.d) Applicant admitted the facts of each allegation, but denied he is dependent on alcohol, that he abuses alcohol, and that his alcohol consumption makes him a security risk. The government also alleged that, in 1999, Applicant was issued a written warning for \u201cdisrespecting\u201d a co-worker (SOR \u00b6 2.a); that he was \u201cdismissed\u201d from a job in July 2002 (SOR \u00b6 2.b); that he was \u201cfired\u201d from a job at a restaurant in January 2003 (SOR \u00b6 2.c); that he was \u201cfired\u201d from another restaurant job in September 2003 (SOR \u00b6 2.d); and that he was \u201cdismissed\u201d from a job in August 2004 (SOR \u00b6 2.e).

Roberts, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for eligibility for a security clearance is granted.\nOn December 1, 2005, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to obtain a security clearance required for his job with\na defense contractor, for whom he has worked since November 2005. (Gx. 1) After\nreviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary\naffirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to allow Applicant\n1\naccess to classified information. On April 30, 2008, DOHA issued to Applicant a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise security concerns addressed in\nDecember 12, 2008\n\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n2\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive.\n This is assumed from the context of the statement.\n3\n2\nthe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under Guideline E (personal conduct) and\n2\nGuideline G (alcohol).\nOn June 19, 2008, Applicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a\nhearing. The case was assigned to me on July 22, 2008, and I convened a hearing on\nSeptember 3, 2008. The parties appeared as scheduled. The government presented\nfour exhibits (Gx. 1 - 4). Applicant testified in his own behalf, submitted two exhibits (Ax.\nA and B) and presented four witnesses. Another witness for Applicant was unexpectedly\ncalled away from the hearing while waiting to testify. After consulting with the parties, I\ncontinued this matter to September 19, 2008. At that time, Department Counsel and\nApplicant\u2019s counsel appeared in person at DOHA headquarters, while Applicant\nappeared by telephone and Applicant\u2019s fifth witness appeared by video-teleconference\n(VTC). DOHA received the transcript of the September 3, 2008, hearing (Tr. I) on\nSeptember 18, 2008, and the transcript of the September 19, 2008, hearing (Tr. II) on\nSeptember 25, 2008. \nAdditionally, I left the record open until September 30, 2008, to allow Applicant\ntime to present additional relevant information. (Tr. II, 28 - 29) Applicant timely\nsubmitted additional information admitted without objection as Ax. C. The record closed\non October 10, 2008, when I received the parties\u2019 written closing arguments.\nProcedural Issues\nApplicant\u2019s Counsel objected to the admission of Gx. 3 based on a lack of\nfoundation. Gx. 3 is a three-page document sent by facsimile on April 24, 2008, to\nDepartment Counsel by an employee in the human resources (HR) staff of a company\nwhere Applicant worked between March and August 2004. The facsimile cover page\nreads in relevant part as follows:\nAs a follow up to our conversation/correspondence [Applicant] was\nterminated prior to [current HR manager\u2019s]  employment with [name of\n3\ncompany]. The enclosed document is the only document in [Applicant\u2019s]\npersonnel file. [HR manager\u2019s] understanding is that it was written by\n[name of Applicant\u2019s former boss] who was Vice President of Support\nServices at the time.\nThe Directive, Section E3.1.20, provides in relevant part that \u201cofficial records or\nevidence compiled in the regular course of business...may be received and considered\nby the Administrative Judge without authenticating witnesses, provided that such\ninformation has been furnished by an investigative agency pursuant to its\nresponsibilities in connection with assisting the Secretary of Defense, or the Department\n\n See, Directive, E3.1.10.\n4\n According to a search on \n5\nwww.google.com, Unix is \u201can operating system for a computer that is capable of\nhandling activity from multiple users. It is the most common OS for servers on the Internet.\u201d\n3\nor Agency head concerned, to safeguard classified information within industry under\nE.O. 10865...\u201d\nOn its face, Gx. 3 was sent directly from Applicant\u2019s former place of employment\nto DOHA Department Counsel. Even if Gx. 3 was admissible under an exception to the\nhearsay rule, the government did not present a witness to lay a foundation that would\nallow admission under Directive E3.1.20. Accordingly, I sustained Applicant\u2019s objection.\n(Tr. I,  26 - 31)  \n4\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is 48 years old. He graduated from college in 1982 with a degree in\nmathematics. His professional experience since about 1994 has been in the information\ntechnology (IT) sector as a Unix  administrator. Since November 2005, he has been\n5\nemployed as such by a defense contractor that is sponsoring his clearance request.\n(Gx. 1) The government alleged in the SOR that Applicant was arrested for, charged\nwith and convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) on December 16,\n2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and on July 31, 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). As part of the sentence for his\n2004 DUI, Applicant was also alleged to have received alcohol counseling in 2007,\nwhich resulted in a diagnosis of alcohol dependence. (SOR \u00b6 1.c) The government\nfurther alleged Applicant first consumed alcohol at age 18 and still consumes alcohol.\n(SOR \u00b6 1.d) Applicant admitted the facts of each allegation, but denied he is dependent\non alcohol, that he abuses alcohol, and that his alcohol consumption makes him a\nsecurity risk.\nThe government also alleged that, in 1999, Applicant was issued a written\nwarning for \u201cdisrespecting\u201d a co-worker (SOR \u00b6 2.a); that he was \u201cdismissed\u201d from a job\nin July 2002 (SOR \u00b6 2.b); that he was \u201cfired\u201d from a job at a restaurant in January 2003\n(SOR \u00b6 2.c); that he was \u201cfired\u201d from another restaurant job in September 2003 (SOR \u00b6\n2.d); and that he was \u201cdismissed\u201d from a job in August 2004 (SOR \u00b6 2.e). Applicant\nadmitted with explanation all of the factual allegations, but denied that he left any of his\njobs due to misconduct.\nOn May 10, 1999, Applicant was working for an IT firm as a Unix Administrator\nwhen he and a co-worker argued over how to resolve a technical problem. The\nargument included shouting at each other and escalated to the point his co-worker tried\nto slam her office door on Applicant, who blocked the door causing it to strike his co-\nworker. Both employees received written reprimands. On May 20, 1999, Applicant\nreceived a performance evaluation from the same person who issued the written\nreprimand. In the evaluation, he was rated average or above average in all categories\nbut one. It was noted that he needed improvement in his interpersonal skills, but the\nevaluation was overall a positive one and he was given a $3,250 raise. Applicant left\nthat company in July 1999, after 28 months, to pursue a better opportunity. A former co-\n\n And possibly because he had broken his arm.\n6\n4\nworker at the company praised Applicant for his professionalism and integrity. (Answer\nto SOR; Gx. 1; Gx. 2; Tr. I, 46 - 51, 101 - 103)\nIn July 2002, Applicant was let go from a Unix administrator\u2019s position after only\nthree months and while he was still in a probationary status as a new employee. He\ndisclosed in his e-QIP that he was told by his employer it \u201cwas not going to work out\u201d\nthere. While he had professional disagreements over how to go about his assigned\nduties, a co-worker stated that Applicant was let go as part of a reduction in force and\nthat, in hindsight, Applicant\u2019s technical approach should have been adopted. The co-\nworker also praised Applicant for his honesty, professionalism and judgment. (Answer\nto SOR; Tr. I, 52 - 54, 104) \nApplicant is currently single, but has been married twice. His first marriage ended\nin 1996, when his wife of 13 years died of heart failure. He remarried in September\n2000, but he and his second wife separated in September 2002. Their divorce was\nfinalized in March 2003. Applicant attributes the marriage\u2019s failure to stress from the\nillness and death of his father in 2001, stress from his employment downturns, and\nstress from his ex-wife\u2019s ongoing child custody battles with her ex-husband. In August\n2003, Applicant moved to the state where he currently lives and works. This is the same\nstate where he went to college. (Gx. 1)\nBetween August 2002 and March 2004, Applicant had trouble finding steady\nwork in his chosen field. He attributed his uneven employment record during that time to\na general downturn in the IT industry and to his August 2003 relocation after his divorce.\nTo make ends meet, he took part-time jobs outside the IT field. Sometimes he also was\nable to find concurrent temporary work in the IT field. In September 2002, he found work\nas a waiter at a local restaurant. The job lasted one month because, as Applicant\nacknowledged, he was not a very good waiter. Applicant has characterized as a\n\u201cpersonality conflict\u201d the fact that he disagreed with the manager\u2019s decision to let him\ngo. (Answer to SOR; Gx. 1; Tr. I, 104 - 106) In September 2003, a month after he\nmoved to the state where now lives, he found work concurrently at a carwash and as a\nbartender. He stopped working at the carwash because he broke his arm on the job. He\nlost his restaurant job the same month because of reorganization.  (Answer to SOR; Gx.\n6\n1)\nApplicant continued working at available IT jobs and at restaurant jobs through at\nleast May 2005. In March 2004, he was hired as a full-time support engineer at an IT\nfirm. The person who hired him for that job left the company almost immediately after\nApplicant started. Applicant did not get along with the person who succeeded the\nperson who hired him. (Tr. I, 62 - 64; Tr. II, 10 - 15) Applicant eventually left the\ncompany. In his response to e-QIP question 22 (Your Employment Record), Applicant\ndisclosed that he left this job in August 2004 under unfavorable conditions. Applicant\ncited conflicting reasons for the end of his employment there (Gx. 1), but has denied\nthat he was fired or that the end of his employment was related to any misconduct. This\nconflicts with the testimony of a former co-worker, whose understanding was that\n\n Not otherwise defined in the record.\n7\n5\nApplicant was fired. (Tr. I, 65 - 66; Tr. II, 15 - 17) A former member of the company\u2019s\nmanagement characterized Applicant as \u201ca model employee...who is honest and ethical,\nhard working, professional and skilled...\u201d (Answer to SOR)\nOn December 16, 2002, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving under\nthe influence of alcohol (DUI). He pleaded guilty, was fined, placed on supervision,  and\n7\nordered to complete a victim impact class. On July 31, 2004, Applicant was again\narrested and charged with DUI. He again pleaded guilty, was fined and placed on\nsupervision. He also was ordered to complete an alcohol safety awareness and\ncounseling course, and to complete 240 hours of community service. \nBoth DUI offenses occurred in the state where he lived when he was married.\nWhen he was arrested the second time, he had been visiting from out of state. Applicant\ncompleted the community service portion and alcohol counseling portions of his\nsentence in the state where he now lives. All of the requirements of his sentence were\ncompleted satisfactorily. When he began the alcohol counseling portion, he was\nprovisionally diagnosed at intake as being alcohol dependent. (Gx. 2) Applicant was told\nthis was a standard entry required because he had two DUIs in his record. (Tr. I, 70)\nThe diagnosis at discharge was alcohol dependence in early partial remission. But there\nwas no recommendation of further treatment and no concern expressed about whether\nApplicant should abstain from alcohol or participate in a 12-step recovery program.\nApplicant was also assessed as having \u201cdemonstrated lower risk.\u201d Applicant drinks\nmoderately when he drinks at all. (Answer to SOR; Gx. 2; Ax. A; Ax. B)\nIn July 2008, Applicant was evaluated about his alcohol consumption by a\nLicensed Psychiatric Counselor (LPC). The evaluation included blood tests designed to\ndetect liver damage from excessive long-term alcohol use. The blood tests were within\nnormal limits, but the evaluation itself was inconclusive pending ongoing evaluation and\ncounseling. (Ax. A) The same LPC evaluated Applicant and gave him the same blood\ntests in September 2008. The LPC concluded at that time that Applicant was not an\nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent. The blood tests were in the normal range for liver\nfunction. The LPC\u2019s evaluation also reported that he has been providing Applicant with\nsubstance abuse counseling and cognitive/behavioral therapy focusing on Applicant\u2019s\nrigidity of thinking and issues related to the loss of his first wife. A supporting\npsychological evaluation included with the LPC\u2019s evaluation showed Applicant does not\nsuffer from any personality disorder and is a low risk for substance abuse or\ndependence. (Ax. C)\nApplicant currently works in computer modeling and simulation efforts in support\nof a U.S. Navy contract. His record over the past three years has been excellent.\nNumerous professional and personal associates have vouched, either in person or in\nwriting, for Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, outstanding professional expertise,\nand integrity. More importantly, his associates and friends have noted his ability to work\nwell with others. There have been no instances, either at work or in the community, of\ninappropriate behavior by the Applicant. Applicant is active in his church, through\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n8\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n9\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n10\n6\nweekly bible study classes, he excels as a member of Toastmasters, and he is an\naccomplished fast-pitch softball umpire and interscholastic wrestling referee. The\ncoordinator of the program through which Applicant completed his court-ordered\ncommunity service reported he \u201cdid an outstanding job of organizing and recruiting\nvolunteers\u201d and \u201cdid a superior job in all tasks that were assigned to him.\u201d (Answer to\nSOR; Ax. A; Tr. I, 134 - 177)\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,8\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG). Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nAG \u00b6 15 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct) and AG \u00b6 21 (Guideline G - Alcohol).\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n9\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  \n10\n\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n11\n7\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the government\nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her\nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of\nany reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the\ngovernment.11\nAnalysis\nAlcohol.\nThe government presented sufficient information to support the allegations in\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, that Applicant was arrested for, charged with and convicted of DUI\nin December 2002 and July 2004, respectively. It also supported the allegation in SOR \u00b6\n1.c, that Applicant received court-ordered counseling after his second DUI, and that the\ncounseling included a diagnosis of alcohol dependence. Finally, the record reflects that\nApplicant started consuming alcohol at age 18 and still consumes alcohol, as alleged in\nSOR \u00b6 1.d. \nThe facts established by the government\u2019s information may raise a security\nconcern, because \u201c[e]xcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d AG \u00b6 21. More specifically, Applicant\u2019s\nDUI convictions require application of the disqualifying condition listed at AG \u00b6 22(a)\n(alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence,\nfighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern,\nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent). \nThe government\u2019s information also tends to support application of the\ndisqualifying conditions at AG \u00b6 22(e) (evaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol\ndependence by a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized\nalcohol treatment program) and AG \u00b6 22(f) (relapse after diagnosis of alcohol abuse or\ndependence and completion of an alcohol rehabilitation program). However, the record\nshows that the basis for the alcohol dependence allegation is a single-page document\nentitled Discharge Summary and provided by Applicant in response to DOHA\ninterrogatories. SOR \u00b6 2.c references the name of the facility where Applicant was\nevaluated, but there is no other identifying information in the record about the facility.\nThus, it is unclear if the program Applicant attended to fulfill a court-ordered counseling\nsession is a recognized alcohol treatment program for purposes of AG \u00b6 22(e). It is\nlikewise unclear whether the person who made the diagnosis is the same person who\nevaluated Applicant. The signature on the form belongs to a CAC (Certified Addictions\nCounselor) as opposed to a Licensed Clinical Social Worker (LCSW). Assuming the\nperson making the diagnosis was qualified to do so, there is no detailed information\n\n8\nfrom the clinician(s) involved about his history of alcohol use or his insight into any\nproblem Applicant might have with alcohol. \nFurther, the only known reason why Applicant was diagnosed at intake as alcohol\ndependent was, as Applicant testified, it was required because he had two DUIs in his\nrecord. There is no detailed record of testing or interview that would show the diagnosis\nis anything more than a perfunctory entry required because of his arrests. (Tr. I, 70) At\nthe end of the counseling program, Applicant was again diagnosed as alcohol\ndependent in early partial remission. However, it was reported that Applicant\n\u201cdemonstrated lower risk\u201d and \u201cno additional treatment recommendations\u201d were made.\nAdditionally, Applicant\u2019s information regarding his evaluations in July 2008 and\nSeptember 2008 support a conclusion he is not a heavy drinker and at low risk for\nalcohol dependence or abuse. There is also substantial testimony that for at least the\npast three years, Applicant has led a stable, sober and responsible lifestyle. All of the\nforegoing, combined with the absence of any information of heavy drinking since at\nleast July 2004, supports application of the mitigating factors at AG \u00b6 22(a) (so much\ntime has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). Applicant\u2019s use of counseling and\nmore reliable clinical evaluations of his alcohol use also support at least partial\napplication of AG \u00b6 22(c) (the individual is a current employee who is participating in a\ncounseling or treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, and\nis making satisfactory progress). I conclude there is no history of treatment and relapse\nbecause, despite a diagnosis of alcohol dependence, it was not recommended he\nabstain from alcohol or engage in any follow-on treatment. Because he successfully\ncompleted the court-ordered counseling program and has demonstrated he is, at most,\na moderate drinker, Applicant also benefits from AG \u00b6 22(d) (the individual has\nsuccessfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation along with any\nrequired aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified\nconsumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as\nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization and has\nreceived a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a licensed\nclinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment\nprogram.). On balance, I conclude that the totality of information probative of the\nsecurity significance of Applicant\u2019s use of alcohol and his past alcohol-related incidents\nis sufficient to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline G.\nPersonal Conduct. \nA security concern may also exist when, as stated in AG \u00b6 15, available\ninformation reflects\n[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.\n\n Closing Argument, page 7.\n12\n9\nI have reviewed the facts and circumstances of this case in the context of\nGuideline E, particularly the fact that Applicant was reprimanded in 1999 after he and a\nco-worker got into an argument that included door slamming and raised voices. That\nevent requires consideration of Guideline E disqualifying condition at AG \u00b6 16(d)(2)\n(credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and\nmay not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined\nwith all available information supports a whole-person assessment of questionable\njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with\nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not\nproperly safeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited to\nconsideration of:... (2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the\nworkplace). \nHowever, contrary to Department Counsel\u2019s argument that \u201cApplicant has been\ninvolved in multiple disruptive events at work that have resulted in negative job\nconsequences,\u201d  I conclude that the record, at worst, shows Applicant is not a good\n12\nwaiter or bartender, that he understandably disagreed with one restaurant managers\ndecision to let him go, and that he had two other jobs where he was not a good fit for\nwhat appear to be professional reasons only. Aside from the 1999 argument, there have\nbeen no other \u201cdisruptive events\u201d in Applicant\u2019s employment background. In contrast to\nthe government\u2019s information, the record shows Applicant has held 16 jobs without\nincident since 1994. Most have been within the IT industry, with some jobs held\nconcurrently when the IT industry was faltering. There is ample information showing that\nApplicant has been and still is an excellent employee. It must be acknowledged, as well,\nthat Applicant may not be a particularly easy person to get along with, owing to the\nrigidity of thinking mentioned in his recent psychological evaluation. \nNonetheless, all of the available information bearing on Applicant\u2019s employment\nhistory, does not support \u201ca whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly\nsafeguard protected information.\u201d On the other hand, the record does support\napplication of the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so minor, or so much\ntime has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). The lone disruptive workplace event\nhappened nearly 10 years ago and references from that job, as well as from many of\nApplicant\u2019s subsequent employers indicate his workplace behavior has not been a\nproblem or concern. Applicant has also engaged in behavioral counseling to improve his\nability to deal with past issues, including stress resulting from his first wife\u2019s death. In\nthat regard, it is also  appropriate to apply the mitigating condition at AG \u00b6 17(d) (the\nindividual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the\nbehavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or\nfactors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such\nbehavior is unlikely to recur). While Applicant may need help with his interpersonal skills\n\n See footnote 8, supra.\n13\n10\nin the workplace, available information about his conduct is sufficient to mitigate the\nstated security concerns under this guideline.\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guidelines E and G. I have also reviewed the record before\nme in the context of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 48 years\nold and presumed to be a mature adult. He has experienced personal and professional\ndifficulties that resulted in a varied employment history between 2002 and 2005, and\nmay have contributed to carelessness in his use of alcohol on two occasions. However,\nhe has moderated and/or eliminated his drinking and is getting professional counseling\nabout alcohol and other behavioral issues. Applicant has been extremely candid and\nforthcoming about his employment history and alcohol consumption. Indeed, much of\nthe information which supports the SOR allegations originated with him. In contrast to\nthe adverse facets of his background, the record shows Applicant is honest, active in\nthe community, hard working, and professional. His alcohol-related conduct occurred\nmore than four years ago, he is at low risk of future alcohol dependence or abuse, and\nthe one documented instance of disruptive behavior in the workplace occurred nearly 10\nyears ago. His job performance in the past three years has been excellent. Over the\nsame period, he has been more stable personally and professionally. A fair and\ncommonsense assessment  of all available information shows Applicant has satisfied\n13\nany doubts about his suitability for access to classified information.\n\n11\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nFOR APPLICANT\n Subparagraph 1.a - 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a - 2.e:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the national interest to\ncontinue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\n                            \n                                                    \nMATTHEW E. MALONE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 42-year-old military operations research analyst. He earned a bachelor of science degree while serving in the United States military. Applicant has two young children from a prior marriage that ended in divorce in 2003. From his current marriage, he has a four-year-old child and a 23-year-old step-son. From 1987 through 1988, Applicant served in the Army National Guard. He then served in the United States Army from 1988 through 2000. He maintained a security clearance throughout this time without incident. He was employed as a network engineer in the private sector after his honorable discharge in December 2000 through August 2002. Up to this point in his career, Applicant had good credit and was in control of his finances. 1 A downturn in the economy following the September 11, 2001, attacks and the subsequent decline in the technology field left Applicant unemployed from August 2002 until June 2003. During that 11 month break in employment, Applicant was divorced and given custody of the two young children from that union.

On June 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns regarding\nfinancial considerations (Guideline F) arising from 10 specifically identified delinquent\ndebts. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended, and Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nOn July 7, 2008, Applicant signed a notarized document in which he denied all\nallegations, citing to a viable debt consolidation plan and to direct payments made\ntoward his obligations. A hearing before an Administrative Judge was requested. I was\nassigned the case and the parties agreed to a hearing date of October 22, 2008. A\nNotice of Hearing was issued on October 6, 2008, to that effect. \nJanuary 9, 2009\n\n Tr. 28.\n    1\n Tr. 27.\n    2\nEx. 9 (\u201cPerson Summary,\u201d dated October 17, 2008).\n    3\n2\nThe hearing was timely convened. Department Counsel introduced nine\ndocuments, accepted into the record without objection as exhibits (Exs.) 1-9. Aided by\nhis wife, Applicant gave testimony and offered two documents, accepted into the record\nwithout objection as Exs. A-B. Applicant\u2019s wife and an associate gave testimony on\nbehalf of Applicant. Applicant was given until November 4, 2008, to submit any\nadditional documents for consideration. The transcript (Tr.) was received on October\n30, 2008. No additional documents were forwarded for admission and the record was\nclosed on November 7, 2008. Based upon a review of the limited case file and exhibits\npresented, Applicant carried his burden and mitigated financial considerations security\nconcerns. Clearance is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 42-year-old military operations research analyst. He earned a\nbachelor of science degree while serving in the United States military. Applicant has\ntwo young children from a prior marriage that ended in divorce in 2003. From his\ncurrent marriage, he has a four-year-old child and a 23-year-old step-son.\nFrom 1987 through 1988, Applicant served in the Army National Guard. He then\nserved in the United States Army from 1988 through 2000. He maintained a security\nclearance throughout this time without incident. He was employed as a network\nengineer in the private sector after his honorable discharge in December 2000 through\nAugust 2002. Up to this point in his career, Applicant had good credit and was in control\nof his finances.  \n1\nA downturn in the economy following the September 11, 2001, attacks and the\nsubsequent decline in the technology field left Applicant unemployed from August 2002\nuntil June 2003. During that 11 month break in employment, Applicant was divorced\nand given custody of the two young children from that union. With his period of\nunemployment being unforeseeably protracted, money became scarce and some pre-\nexisting accounts became delinquent. Committed to not acquiring any additional new\ndebt as the year went by, he ultimately made the decision to prioritize his bills. His top\npriorities were for current expenses and family medical needs. He kept current on such\nbills by accepting temporary, part-time assignments.  In June 2003, he was hired for a\n2\nposition requiring a security clearance, and an interim security clearance was granted.3\nThe economy again impacted his employment when he lost his job in early September\n2003. He again resorted to temporary work in order to cover current living and medical\nexpenses and preclude the accumulation of more delinquent debt. As a consequence,\nsome of the bills that became delinquent during his last period of unemployment and\nsome of the debts accrued early on during that same period remain unpaid. Ultimately,\n\n Tr. 50.\n    4\n Tr. 28. The child was deemed ineligible for disability because he had not worked a sufficient amount of\n    5\ntime. Tr. 57.\n Tr. 51. Applicant estimated a minimum of $10,000 in medical bills was paid out of pocket for family medical\n    6\nexpenses between late 2002 and 2007. Tr. 56-57.\n Tr. 52.\n    7\n Tr. 51.\n    8\n3\nhe accepted a position with his most recent employer in late February 2004, around the\nsame time the technology sector stabilized. \nIn addition to Applicant\u2019s two periods of unemployment, divorce, and assumption\nof child custody, Applicant has also been responsible for extraordinary medical\nexpenses. His medical insurance did not cover, or only minimally covered, necessary\nmedical care related to chiropractic and dental problems for his children from his prior\nmarriage. Additionally, Applicant\u2019s new wife has had significant health issues in the past\ncouple of years. Problematic dentition led to the removal of many of her teeth, requiring\na partial bridge and other dental care not covered by health insurance.  Moreover, she\n4\nsuffers from severe sleep apnea which has demanded extensive medical attention and\nrelated expenses. This condition not only contributed to her 2006 heart attack and\nregular migraines, but it also has affected her ability to work full-time. As well, her 23-\nyear-old son from a prior marriage incurred uncovered medical care debts while he was\na dependent. The child suffers from a debilitating form of rheumatoid arthritis.  As a\n5\nresult, that son has found it difficult to work. Applicant and his wife, however, have\nlimited their responsibility for his medical bills to those acquired while he was a\ndependent. Applicant and his wife agree that they have considered medical care a top\npriority. In all, they state that they have managed \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of dollars in\nmedical care over the past few years.6\nApplicant first discovered the full extent of his delinquent debt when he received\nthe SOR in June 2008. By that time, Applicant had already instituted measures to\naddress some of his delinquent accounts. In order to address their debts and still live\nwithin their means, Applicant and his wife developed a strict budget which Applicant\u2019s\nwife oversees.  Although Applicant has made it a priority to make sure his children are\n7\neducated and receiving appropriate medical care, he has explained his financial\nsituation to their children. The elder children are aware that their parents can no longer\nassist them financially.  Consequently, the eldest two have moved out of the home and\n8\nlive independently, leaving only the four-year-old and a teenager at home. \nUnable to work efficiently due to her sleep apnea, Applicant\u2019s wife provides\ndaycare for their four-year-old and manages the home. She has sold their non-essential\npossessions, mostly at flea markets. She also earns $300-$500 a month making crafts\nand infant clothing items. Applicant maintains a part-time job to supplement the family\n\n Tr. 45.\n    9\n Tr. 48 (\u201cI think the last time we went out was for our anniversary.\u201d)\n    10\n  SOR allegations 1.a \u2013 1.j.\n    11\n Ex.

The vast majority of\navailable income goes to their old debt and current daily living expenses.\nEntertainment, eating out, and extras are at a minimum.10\nThe SOR notes 10 delinquent obligations, amounting to approximately\n$19,000.  With regard to the 10 debts noted in the SOR, Applicant sought advice and\n11\nguidance from financial conselors. Applicant provided evidence that commenced\nrepayment on four of the accounts through a debt consolidation repayment plan.12\nThrough that plan, $270 is deducted from his personal account for monthly\ndisbursements toward the accounts noted in the SOR under allegations 1.a, 1.c, 1.f,\nand 1i.  Additionally, a prior balance of approximately $2,325 to an account noted at\n13\nSOR allegation 1.d has been reduced to approximately $1,424 through direct\npayments.  Moreover, direct payment resumed in the summer of 2008 on the account\n14\nnoted in SOR allegation 1.j with an approximate balance of $2,257.15\nApplicant has been unsuccessful thus far in addressing the four remaining\naccounts. He has been unable to find information about the account noted at SOR\nallegation 1.b for a balance of approximately $2,081.  He is attempting to add the\n16\nobligation noted at SOR allegation 1.e for approximately $1,468 to the consolidation\nplan.  Information on the telecommunications accounts noted in the SOR as\n17\nallegations 1.g and 1.h, for approximately $425 and $121, respectively, had only\nrecently been received.  Applicant is in the process of adding them to the consolidation\n18\nplan.19\n\n Tr. 21.\n    20\n Tr. 2-21.\n    21\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd.

Applicant\u2019s former\nboss spoke highly of Applicant\u2019s work efforts and product, noting Applicant was poised\nfor promotion before these financial issues were raised.  Applicant\u2019s former supervisor\n20\nknows of no reason to doubt Applicant\u2019s ability to maintain classified information and\nhas no reason to think Applicant lives beyond his finances.21\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines\nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior,\nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative\nprocess. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial\nand common sense decision. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny\nof a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n22\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n23\n24\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\n\n Id.\n    25\n Executive Order 10865 \u00a7 7.\n    26\n Revised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18.\n    27\n6\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \u201cThe clearly consistent standard\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access\n25\nto sensitive information must be resolved in favor of protecting such sensitive\ninformation. The decision to deny an individual a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication that the\n26\napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense\nhave established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nBased upon consideration of the evidence, I find Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations) to be the most pertinent to the case. Under that guideline, failure or an\ninability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may\nindicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and\nregulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Conversely, an individual\nwho is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  The Regulation sets out several potential disqualifying conditions. \n27\nApplicant was unemployed for about 17 out of the 19 months between August\n2002 and February 2004. Combined with a divorce, custody of his children, and a\nnumber of medical bills which required immediate payment, Applicant acquired debt\nwhich became delinquent. Much of that debt remains unpaid to date. Consequently,\nFinancial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d) and .FC DC AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations\u201d) apply. With such conditions raised, it is left to Appellant to\novercome the case against him and mitigate security concerns. \nShifts in the technology field and market affected Applicant twice and caused\nhim to be unemployed for about 17 months between August 2002 and February 2004.\n\n7\nIn the interim, he was divorced and he assumed custody of his two young children.\nAddressing his debts became more difficult as his period of unemployment dragged on\nand he became increasingly responsible for a number of unforeseeable and necessary\nmedical bills accrued by family members. Short of financial resources, he devoted his\nlimited available funds to current medical and living expenses. In this manner, he\nattempted to provide his family with necessities while precluding the accumulation of\nmore delinquent debt. Therefore, Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC\nMC) AG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the behavior were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation) and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances\u201d) applies.\nFollowing his first bout of unemployment, Applicant was given a reprieve with\nemployment that commenced in the middle of 2003. The reprieve, however, was brief.\nThrough no fault of his own, he was unemployed again by September 2003. As a result,\nhe was unable to make any significant progress on his previously acquired delinquent\ndebt or to save for his next period of unemployment. At the time, these two periods\nwere unique to his area of expertise (technology) and were unfortunate interruptions to\nan otherwise continuous history of employment. During these periods of\nunemployment, however, he maintained custody of his children, made sure an\nappropriate education and medical care was provided, and did his best to limit his\nacquisition of additional delinquent debt. There is no indication that he lived\nextravagantly or otherwise exercised poor financial judgment. Once he returned to the\nwork force, he and his wife developed a strict budget to guide them and he began\nrepayment on his delinquent debt. Therefore, Financial Considerations Mitigating\nCondition (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent,\nor occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) and FC\nMC AG \u00b6 20(d) (\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts\u201d) apply.\nApplicant has received assistance from a debt consolidator, but he failed to show\nthat he received actual financial counseling. Therefore, FC MC AG \u00b6 20(c) (\u201cthe person\nhas received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d) cannot apply.\nThrough a repayment plan, Applicant is addressing four of the ten accounts at\nissue. Two additional accounts are being addressed by him through direct payment. Of\nthe remaining four accounts, he is preparing to add three of the accounts to the\nrepayment plan. He has been unable to find information as to the fourth account.\nAlthough financial counseling is clearly warranted, there is no evidence it has been\nreceived. On the other hand, there is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s acquisition of\ndelinquent debt was the result of poor self-control, lack of judgment, or an unwillingness\nto abide by rules and regulations, nor is there evidence that he is unreliable or\nuntrustworthy. Applicant\u2019s periods of unemployment were both recent and significant.\nBy showing his efforts to address his delinquent debts through his debt consolidation\n\n8\nexperts and the efforts he has done independently, Applicant has demonstrated his\ndesire and ability to address his debts.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the\nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature,\nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct,\nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;\n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a public trust position must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole person\u201d factors.\nApplicant is a mature and educated man with significant work experience. The record\nshows that he applies diligence in both his professional and personal life. \nThrough no fault of his own, Applicant experienced two significant and protracted\nperiods of unemployment. Proactively, he resorted to temporary and part-time jobs to\nlessen the financial burden on his family and to prevent the acquisition of further\ndelinquent debt. Today, Applicant continues with a part-time job. His wife continues to\nprovides daycare and earns an additional $300-$500 per month for her crafts and\nhandiwork. Applicant responsibly saw to it that his eldest child and his wife\u2019s eldest child\nwere educated before they left the household to become self-supporting. Applicant\u2019s\nwife has sold off their non-essential possessions. The couple has downsized their living\nsituation. Through these efforts, Applicant defrayed both his family\u2019s daily expenses\nand immediate medical expenses, areas which he considered to be priorities both\nduring the lean times and today. All of these efforts helped limit Applicant\u2019s acquisition\nof new debt. \nThe couple has no on-going obligations except for monthly housing expenses\nand a note on one truck. They live comfortably, albeit within a strict budget. Applicant\nstarted repayment on two of the delinquent accounts before receiving the SOR; he has\nsince started repayment on six of the ten accounts at issue. Three more accounts have\nbeen verified and are poised for inclusion on his repayment plan. Only one account, of\nwhich he has been unsuccessful in his efforts to verify the account information and\nbalance, remains unaddressed.\n\n9\nApplicant\u2019s acquisition of debt was not the result of poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or an unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations. Based on the facts\nregarding his lifestyle and his periods of unemployment, there is no indication that his\ndebt raises questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, or ability to protect classified\ninformation. Although he still owes significant debt, he has made appropriate strides to\naddress that debt and instituted organized repayments on the majority of the accounts.\nIn light of these financial considerations and the \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis, I find that\nApplicant has mitigated financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.I:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the facts and circumstances presented by the record in this case,\nit is clearly consistent with national security to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Clearance is granted.\nARTHUR E. MARSHALL, JR.\nAdministrative Judge\n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 13, 2008, denying all of the allegations\nexcept 1.a and 2.a,  and requested a hearing. I received the case assignment on\n1\nSeptember 22, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 9, 2008, and I convened\nthe hearing as scheduled on November 3, 2008. During the hearing, I received 10\ngovernment exhibits, 14 Applicant exhibits and the testimony of two Applicant\nDecember 18, 2008\n\n2\nwitnesses. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on November 12, 2008. Based\nupon a review of the record, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 31-year-old, single man. He earned a bachelor of science degree\nin decision science information systems in 2003 (Tr. 51), and has taken some graduate\ncourses in health and exercise fitness (Tr. 23). For the past 15 months, he has worked\nfor a defense contractor as a communications/networking technician (Tr. 145).\nAccording to Applicant\u2019s supervisor, who supervises 31 people, he is the best out of the\n31 employees who work for the company. (Tr. 145).\nApplicant served in the US Army Reserve from 2000 to 2005. He worked as a\nshower, laundry and textile repair specialist for a combat support hospital unit (Exhibit 4\nat 1). On November 23, 2004, the Army issued orders assigning him to a reserve\ncomponent. Applicant reported, as ordered. A few days later, Applicant\u2019s unit received\npartial mobilization orders, and were transferred to another military facility (Exhibit L at\n2). On December 6, 2004, Applicant was ordered to extended active duty, and to report\nto another military facility (Exhibit 4 at 14). He did not report (Exhibit 4 at 6). \nOn January 19, 2005, Applicant was charged under sections 85 and 87 of the\nUniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) with leaving his place of duty with the intent to\nshirk important duty, and missing movement (Exhibit 4 at 7). Approximately six months\nlater in June 2005, a police officer stopped Applicant\u2019s car, and charged him with\nspeeding (Tr. 41). A roadside background check revealed the outstanding military\ncharges. Applicant was then arrested, and transferred to a detention facility on an Army\nbase.\nApplicant contends that he never received the December 2004 orders to report to\nactive duty. When he informed his unit commander, he was told he could not be on post\nwithout orders, and sent home (Exhibit N). Between the time Applicant went home in\nDecember 2004, and the time he was arrested, he continued to drill with his unit at the\ncombat support hospital (Tr. 43). \nWhile awaiting court martial, the Army prosecutor told him that the Army would\ndrop the charges, if he either agreed to re-enroll on active duty for three additional\nyears, or administratively separate under other than honorable conditions. Because he\ndid not want to quit his civilian job that he held at the time, he chose the latter option\n(Exhibit 6). \nDuring the separation process, the Army informed Applicant that he had been\noverpaid by approximately $10,000 while in the reserves (Tr. 53). Applicant was\nunaware of these overpayments. Since then, the government has been intercepting his\nannual income tax refunds, and applying them to the debt (Tr. 55) In February 2007,\nApplicant stated that he intended to arrange a payment plan to satisfy the overpayment\n\n3\n(Exhibit 10). He has not yet organized one. The current balance is approximately\n$6,500.\nApproximately five years ago, Applicant\u2019s father sought to purchase a home\ncomputer (Tr. 56). He asked Applicant if he could use his name to open a credit account\nto finance the purchase (Id.). Applicant agreed. His father did not make payments on\nthe account, as promised. Consequently, Applicant\u2019s credit report reflects a $3,300\ndelinquency owed to the computer company (SOR subparagraph 1.b). Applicant\ncontends that the delinquency, at his request, has been deleted from his credit report\n(Tr. 25).\nApplicant\u2019s credit report also lists an allegedly delinquent credit card bill for\napproximately $1,500 (SOR subparagraph 1.c). He denies this is his debt. In July 2008,\nhe wrote a letter notifying each of the credit reporting agencies of the dispute, and sent\nit via certified mail (Exhibits E through I). In October 2008, he received a letter from the\ncreditor confirming his responsibility for the debt (Exhibit J). Applicant continues to\ndispute the bill, and does not intend to satisfy it.\nCurrently, Applicant earns $80,000 per year (Tr. 137). He maintains a budget\nwhich he plans to update to reflect a recent raise (Tr. 138). He has no trouble paying his\nmonthly bills (Tr. 138). \nOn June 5, 2006, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions. In\nresponse to questions regarding whether he had ever been 180 or more days\ndelinquent on a debt, and whether he was currently 90 days overdue on any debts, he\nanswered \u201cNo.\u201d Applicant was unaware that the debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.a,\nwas delinquent when he completed the security clearance application. It was first\nreported delinquent in April 2006 (Exhibit B). As for SOR subparagraph 1.b, Applicant\nconfronted his father after receiving a delinquent notice. His father then reassured\nApplicant that he would pay the debt. Because Applicant stopped receiving delinquent\nnotices after their conversation, he assumed his father had any future correspondence\nforwarded, and had begun paying the bill, as promised.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\n\n4\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security. Under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is responsible for presenting\n\u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The Applicant has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual=s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information\u201d\n(AG \u00b6 18). Moreover, \u201can individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having\nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s credit report reflects approximately $13,000 of delinquent debt\naccrued between 2003 and 2006. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d apply. \nBecause Applicant was unaware that the government was overpaying him while\nhe was in the reserves, I do not attach any negative security significance to the accrual\nof the debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.a. Moreover, because he is no longer in the\nreserves, the circumstances surrounding the accrual of this debt are unlikely to recur.\nAG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior . . . occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment,\u201d is potentially applicable. However, Applicant has known about the debt\nsince approximately 2005, and has taken no steps to satisfy it, despite promising to do\nso as early as February 2007. This reflects poor judgment, and therefore renders AG \u00b6\n20(a) inapplicable.\nApplicant did not raise any issues regarding circumstances beyond his control\nwhich contributed to his financial delinquencies. AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d does not\napply.\n\nThe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the\n2\nproblem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of\nactions to resolve the issue.\n5\nNone of the remaining mitigating conditions apply. The only debt that Applicant\nintends to satisfy is the one listed in SOR subparagraph 1.a. Although the government\nhas been using his tax refunds to satisfy it, Applicant has not taken any steps to arrange\na payment plan, and the debt has been delinquent for two years. Although he handled\nthe dispute of SOR subparagraph 1.c in a comprehensive manner, notifying each credit\nreporting agency by certified mail, the creditor subsequently rejected his claim. He still\nmaintains that it is not his debt, and does not intend to pay it. Consequently, he no\nlonger has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt, and AG \u00b6\n20(e)  is inapplicable.\n2\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern is as follows:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\nHere, Applicant was administratively separated from the US Army reserves after being\ncharged with desertion and \u201cmissing movement\u201d under UCMJ Articles 85 and 87. AG \u00b6\n31(a), \u201ca single serious crime . . .\u201d applies.\nApplicant testified persuasively that his failure to report to the base where he was\nassigned stemmed from a miscommunication between his reserve unit and his base\nfrom where the order originated. Specifically, between the time he missed movement\nand the time he was arrested, he continued to drill with his unit. This constitutes\nevidence that he did not commit the offense of desertion, which requires that the\nconduct be intentional. AG \u00b6 32(c), \u201cevidence that the person did not commit the offense\napplies. He did, however, miss movement in violation of UCMJ Article 87.\nApplicant has not engaged in any criminal activity since the offense. He is well-\nrespected on his job. The circumstances that led to the UCMJ charges were unusual\nand unlikely to recur, particularly because he is no longer in the armed services. AG \u00b6\u00b6\n32(a), \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened\nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d and 32(d), \u201cthere is\nevidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to the passage of time\nwithout recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher\neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement,\u201d apply.\n\n6\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance application omissions raise the issue of whether\nAG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to\nconduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities,\u201d applies. The record is inconclusive with respect to the issue of whether\nApplicant\u2019s debt stemming from his overpayment was delinquent when he completed\nthe security clearance application. Consequently, I conclude he did not intentionally omit\nit. As for SOR subparagraph 1.b, Applicant\u2019s testimony that he assumed his father had\nsatisfied it was credible in light of his father\u2019s reassurances. Applicant has consistently\ndisputed SOR subparagraph 1.c. He therefore had no responsibility to list it. \nIn gauging Applicant\u2019s credibility, I noted that he disclosed the nature of the discharge\nfrom the US Army reserve on his security clearance application.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct happened under unusual circumstances, and is\nhighly unlikely to recur. He testified persuasively that he did not desert the Army\nreserves, as defined in UCMJ Art. 85. Nevertheless, the conduct resulted in his\nadministrative discharge under other than honorable conditions, which occurred less\nthan four years ago. Consequently, I conclude the nature, extent, and seriousness of\nthe conduct remain undiminished. \nThe security concern is compounded by the delinquency stemming from his\noverpayment that the US Army discovered during the administrative discharge process.\n\n7\nApplicant has yet to make payment arrangements even though he promised to do so\nnearly two years ago. Upon considering this case in the context of the whole person\nconcept, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant\u2019s three minor children acquired Pakistani citizenship at\nbirth through their father, which they can retain until age 21, at which point they must\nmake an election between their U.S. citizenship and their Pakistani citizenship. His two\nchildren who were born in the U.K. have also become U.S. citizens.\nApplicant\u2019s parents and father-in-law are deceased. He has nine siblings, most of\nwhom are much older than him.

Both moved to\nCanada after they retired.\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n3\nApplicant talks to some of his siblings as often as monthly. However, his family\ncontacts appear more haphazard than regular. He traveled to Pakistan in June 2002,\nDecember 2003, January 2004, August 2004, and August 2005. None of his family\nmembers is aware that his job requires a security clearance.\nPakistan is an Islamic parliamentary democracy with a poor human rights record.\nNevertheless, Pakistan has actively cooperated with the U.S. in the global war on\nterrorism. However, terrorist groups operate in Pakistan, making safety and security an\nissue. Pakistan is not on the National Counterintelligence Center\u2019s list of most active\nnations engaging in foreign economic collection and industrial espionage. It is not\nknown to be an active collector of U.S. intelligence information, nor is it known to target\nits expatriate former citizens to obtain U.S. information.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial common sense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline B. \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\n\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 6.\n3\nRevised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 7.(a).\n4\n4\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline B (Foreign Influence), an applicant\u2019s foreign contacts and\ninterests may raise security concerns if the individual 1) has divided loyalties or foreign\nfinancial interests, 2) may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group,\norganization, or government in a way contrary to U.S. interests, or 3) is vulnerable to\npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Foreign influence adjudications can and\nshould consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located\u2014including, but not limited to, whether the country is known\nto target U.S. citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.  Evaluation of an individual\u2019s qualifications for access to protected information\n3\nrequires careful assessment of both the foreign entity\u2019s willingness and ability to target\nprotected information, and to target ex-patriots who are U.S. citizens to obtain that\ninformation, and the individual\u2019s susceptibility to influence, whether negative or positive.\nMore specifically, an individual\u2019s contacts with foreign family members (or other foreign\nentities or persons) raise security concerns only if those contacts create a heightened\nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.4\nIn this case, the government established a case for disqualification under\nGuideline B. However, the security concern relates more to the potential terrorist threats\nto safety and security than to the Pakistani government. Considering first the country\ninvolved, Pakistan and the U.S. enjoy good foreign relations. It has not been\ndemonstrated that the Pakistani government is actively engaged in the collection of U.S.\nintelligence, or that it targets its expatriate citizens in such a way that would make\nApplicant or his family members likely targets for coercion, duress, or influence. The\nterrorist activity in Pakistan is largely intended to invoke generalized fear in the\npopulation and influence the Pakistani government in its support for U.S. operations in\nAfghanistan. There is no evidence to suggest that terrorist groups are targeting\nexpatriate Pakistanis, or their family members, to obtain U.S. information.\nConsidering Applicant\u2019s circumstances, the government produced little evidence\nthat there was a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion because of Applicant\u2019s limited family contacts with his family\nmembers in Pakistan. Applicant\u2019s contacts with his siblings are widely diffused. His\ntravel to Pakistan has no independent security significance, but serves to show some\nadditional level of contact with his siblings.\nAt the outset, the government\u2019s evidence supports no security concerns for\nApplicant\u2019s family members, including his wife and children, who are resident citizens of\nthe U.S., the U.K., or Canada, whether or not they remain citizens of Pakistan. And\nindeed, the government articulated no security concerns surrounding the governments\nof Canada and the U.K.\u2014including concerns relating to Applicant, who appears to retain\n\n5\nhis U.K. citizenship. Nor is there any reason to find security concerns related to\nApplicant\u2019s two sisters, both housewives, who reside in Canada as legal permanent\nresidents with their Canadian-citizen husbands. Except as discussed below, none of\nApplicant\u2019s family members residing in Pakistan have any connection to the Pakistani\ngovernment. A brother who served in the Pakistani army retired to the U.K. where he\nholds citizenship. Two brothers-in-law who, served in the Pakistani army and as an\nengineer with the Pakistani government, retired to Canada where they are both citizens.\nThe one family member who raises a scintilla of a security concern is the brother-in-law\nwho was recently appointed a deputy attorney general for Pakistan. However, the\nconnection between the brother-in-law and Applicant is extremely remote, as the\nbrother-in-law is married to Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s sister. Applicant\u2019s connection to the\nPakistani government through this remote in-law would always be balanced (even if it\nwas shown to be more direct) against the fact that Pakistan is not known to seek\nprotected U.S. information, or to target its ex-patriate citizens to obtain U.S. information.\nIn this case, the connection seems too tenuous to constitute a significant security\nconcern. Furthermore, if both Pakistan and Applicant no longer consider him a Pakistani\ncitizen, any prospect of pressure seems remote. Under these circumstances, I conclude\nthat it is unlikely Applicant can be pressured based on his family members in Pakistan.\nAccordingly, I resolve Guideline B for Applicant.\nFormal Findings\n   Paragraph 1.

Goldstein, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nAugust 7, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on October 24,\n2006. On March 24, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines F and\nE for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on May 8, 2008, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on\nMay 20, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 27, 2008, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on June 24, 2008.  The Government offered Exhibits 1 through 6,\nwhich were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and\nsubmitted Exhibits A through O, without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the\nhearing (Tr) on July 2, 2008. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until\n\n2\nJuly 8, 2008, to submit additional matters.  He failed to submit any additional\ndocuments, and the record closed on July 8, 2008. Based upon a review of the case\nfile, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR Applicant admitted SOR allegations1.a., 1.b., 1.f., 1.g., 1.h., 1.i., and\n1.j., and he denied 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., and 2.a. The admitted allegations are incorporated\nherein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's Answer to the SOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of\nApplicant, and upon due consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of\nfact: \nApplicant is 47 years old. He is currently married for a second time, and he has\nthree children and one stepchild. \nApplicant works for defense contractors, and he seeks a DoD security clearance\nin connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nParagraph 1 Guideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe SOR lists 10 allegations regarding financial difficulties under Adjudicative\nGuideline F (1.a. through 1.j). All of the allegations will be discussed in the same order\nas they were listed in the SOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt to Creditor 1 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $304.\nApplicant testified that this debt was from a cable company for three pieces of\nequipment that remained in his possession. He claimed that he has now returned the\npieces of equipment, and he had a receipt showing this debt had been resolved. Upon\ncross examination from Department Counsel, Applicant conceded that this was a\ndifferent debt from this creditor, and he has not yet resolved this debt. \n1.b. This overdue debt to Creditor 2 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $610,\nand Applicant testified that it remains unpaid. \n1.c. This overdue debt to Creditor 3 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $2,169.\nApplicant testified that this debt had been paid. Exhibit O consists of a one page\nstatement of account from this creditor, showing that the creditor has received full\npayment on this debt. I find that this previously overdue debt  has been resolved. \n1.d. This overdue debt to Creditor 4 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $2,620,\nand it remains unpaid. Applicant testified that he had paid approximately $6,000 to the\ncollection agency for this debt as he was informed that $6,000 would be payment in full.\nHe was not sure why the credit report still show $2,000 owing on this debt, but he is in\n\n3\nthe process of disputing the $2,000 remaining on this debt. Exhibit J is a letter from the\ncollection agency for this creditor, which states that Applicant\u2019s payment had resolved\nthis debt. It appears that Applicant has made a good faith effort to resolve this debt. \n1.e. This overdue debt to Creditor 5 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $5,654.\nApplicant testified that this debt for the repossession of a vehicle, that he cosigned for\nhis daughter, has been paid. Exhibit K includes a copy of check made out to the creditor\non February 8, 2008, in the full amount that is owing. I find that this previously overdue\ndebt has been resolved.\n1.f. This overdue debt to Creditor 6 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $587,\nand Applicant testified that it remains unpaid. \n1.g. This overdue debt to Creditor 7 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $953,\nand Applicant testified that it remains unpaid.\n1.h. This overdue debt to Creditor 8 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $605,\nand Applicant testified that it remains unpaid.\n1.i. In March 1997, Applicant filed a Chapter 7 petition of bankruptcy in the United\nStates Bankruptcy Court.\n1.j. In July 1997, the Chapter 7  bankruptcy petition, previously filed by Applicant\non March 1997, discharged Applicant\u2019s debts. Applicant testified that his previous wife\nhad incurred a considerable amount of debt while they were married. After they were\ndivorced, she did not contribute to paying any of these debts, so he finally filed for\nbankruptcy, which did discharge all of his debts.  \nApplicant cited several factors for his current financial difficulties. When he was\ntransferred because of his employment his income was reduced significantly. Also, his\nwife became unexpectedly pregnant, 19 years after her last pregnancy, and they\nincurred between $5,000 and $6,000 in medical bills, above what was covered under\ntheir insurance policy. \nWhen he was transferred to California he continued to make payments on his\nhome in New Mexico, which he has successfully retained. He also testified that he put\nbetween $7,000 and $9,000 into this home so it could be rented. As of the month of the\nhearing he now has a renter, and he will have an additional $900 a month to help him\nresolve his overdue debts. He also sold a piece of property that he owned, and with the\nproceeds of that sale he paid $21,000 for one year rent, which will soon end, for a home\nfor him and his wife and new son.\nApplicant testified that his plan has been to resolve the largest overdue debts first\nand then take care of the smaller one. He represents that his current finances are in\ngood order and he believes that he will be able to pay all his current and future bills in a\ntimely manner.\n\n4\nParagraph 2 Guideline E, Personal Conduct\n2.a. Applicant executed a signed Security Clearance Application (SCA) on\nOctober 24, 2006 (Exhibit 1). Question 28A asks, if in the last 7 years, Applicant has\nbeen over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to this\nquestion. The Government alleges that Applicant should have answered \u201cYes\u201d to this\nquestion and included the debts listed as 1.a. through 1.h., in the SOR.\nApplicant agreed that he should have responded \u201cYes\u201d to that question and\nincluded all of his debts, but he averred that through inattentiveness he did not list the\ndebts on the SOR. He testified credibly that he did not intend to mislead the\nGovernment on his SCA, and he pointed out other errors that he made on the SCA to\nshow that he was not as careful as he should have been, but he did not knowing furnish\nfalse information. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.   \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \n\n5\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect \n[sensitive] \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns.\nUnder AG \u00b6 19 (a), an Inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts is potentially\ndisqualifying. Similarly under AG  \u00b6 19 (c), a history of not meeting financial obligations\nmay raise security concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt and was\nunable to pay some obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise\nthese potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate\ntrustworthiness concerns arising from financial difficulties.\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nUnder AG \u00b6  20 (b), it may be mitigating where the conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. As noted above, some of\nthe financial problems arose from Applicant\u2019s transfer of employment with significant\nloss of income, the dissolution of his previous marriage which resulted in his bankruptcy\n\n6\nfiling in 1997, and the medical bill of his current spouse, because of her unexpected\npregnancy.  Applicant  acted responsibly in continuing to pay his for the support of his\nwife and his their new son and managing his property assets by repairing his home so it\ncould be rented out. I find this potentially mitigating condition is a factor for\nconsideration in this case. \nAG \u00b6  20 (d) is also applicable as the evidence is clear that Applicant has\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay his overdue creditors and otherwise resolve his\ndebts. Applicant has now reduced his overdue debt from $13,502 to $3,059, and  he\nhas indicated he will be able to resolve the remainder as well.  \n Applicant has now satisfied most of his financial difficulties, and he is better\nprepared for future contingencies. I conclude these potentially mitigating conditions\napply.\nGUIDELINE E, PERSONAL CONDUCT\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nWhile AG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying, I find that none apply in this case. As discussed above, Applicant was\ncredible in his testimony that he did not knowingly furnish the Government with false or\nincomplete information regarding his finances on questions 28a of the SCA that he\ncompleted. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \n\n7\nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuidelines F and E, in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nBased on all of the reasons cited above, including Applicant\u2019s reasons for his previous\nfinancial difficulties, his conscientious efforts to resolve his overdue debts, and his\nimproving economic condition today, I find that the record evidence leaves me without\nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance\nunder the whole person concept. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated\nthe security concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nMartin H. Mogul\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On February 14, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under drug\ninvolvement (Guideline H), criminal conduct (Guideline J), and personal conduct\n(Guideline E). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and made\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after September 1,\n2006. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is denied. \nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR was undated, and had no time stamp of receipt by\nDOHA. The answer was notarized by a notary public whose commission expires on\nNovember 12, 2010. Applicant elected to have his case decided on the record in lieu of\na hearing. DOHA mailed a File of Relevant Material (FORM, information provided to an\nAugust 28, 2008\n\n2\napplicant to support the allegations of the SOR) to Applicant on June 18, 2008. He\nreceived the FORM on June 24, 2008. His response was due on July 4, 2008. No\nresponse was submitted. I was assigned the case on August 15, 2008. \nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR alleges drug involvement, criminal conduct, and personal conduct.\nApplicant admitted all allegations of the SOR. He has been married since March 2003,\nand has one 6-year-old child. He graduated from a state university in December 2005\nwith a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Computer Engineering. He seeks a secret clearance.  \nDrug Involvement\nThe first paragraph of the SOR describes Applicant\u2019s drug involvement which he\ndisclosed in his Security Clearance Questionnaire (SCA) dated April 4, 2007, and his\nanswers to interrogatories he furnished on January 11, 2008. \n\u0097 1.a. Though he described his cocaine use in Item 6 (answers to\ninterrogatories) as occurring \u201coff and on\u201d during weekends until 2005, in Item 4 (SCA\ndated April 16, 2007), he stated that:\nonce I moved to [college town] and quit doing ecstacy, I liked this\n(cocaine) more and more to keep me up all night. I hate it in the morning\nand kept thinking I would quit. But because I began to drink so heavily in\ncollege many times when I would drink too much I would end up doing this\nif I had the chance. Again I never let this mess up my school or my other\nresponsibilities, but it was just another example of my being lost at the\ntime.\n\u0097 1.b., 1.c. Since Applicant described his LSD and mushroom use in Items 4 and\n6, the two drugs shall be addressed together in these factual findings. He described his\nsporadic use of the two drugs as occurring between August 1998 and August 2003. He\ndid not use these drugs much because he did not like the effect, and he had some bad\nexperiences with the drugs. \n\u0097 1.d., 1.e. Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana began in May 1998, and ended in\nAugust 1998. He stopped using the drug when peer pressure steered him to more\nserious drugs.\n\u0097 1.f., 1.g. Applicant used ecstasy on many weekends between August 1998 and\nJune 2000. He purchased the drug for his friends. Concerning the frequency of use,\nApplicant stated:\nOnce I tried it I wanted to do it whenever we got the chance. The more I\ndid it the more \u201cpopular\u201d I got and that me want to do it even more. I\neventually became the person that would get it for my growing group of\n\n3\nfriends and I. Even though I never went far enough to mess up my school I\nwas lost and I became more and more identified with my new \u201clifestyle\u201d\nthat for the first time provided me with a lot of \u201ccool\u201d friends and girls. (Item\n4)\n\u0097 1.h. Applicant used drugs in June 2004 while holding a security clearance, and\nworking for one of military branches of government. See, Item 4., Section 26.\nRegarding his efforts to try to fool the government about his use, Applicant\nstated:\nBefore my being saved in the church I had no problem being dishonest\nwhen it was to my benefit. I thought I could hide my drug use to get a co-\nop (college internship with the government), but when the polygraph\nshowed I was being dishonest I just tried to give half-truths. I am now\nbeing complet(e)ly open and honest because it is by God\u2019s grace that I\neven have this opportunity. (Item 6)\nCriminal Conduct\nApplicant used cocaine after being granted a security clearance in June 2004. \nPersonal Conduct\nApplicant signed an SCA on May 12, 2003, certifying that all entries on the\nsecurity form were true to the best of his knowledge, and made in good faith. Applicant\nanswered \u201cNo\u201d to question 27, requiring information regarding any drug use since the\nage of 16 or in the last 7 years. He intentionally omitted all his drug use, including use of\ncocaine, marijuana, ecstasy, LSD, and mushrooms. \nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant provided no independent evidence regarding his job performance or his\nlifestyle. He stated that after moving to the local area in about December 2005, he\nattended church with his child and had a religious awakening. He stopped using all\ndrugs and alcohol. He and his family have become an integral part of their church. He\noperates a tutorial ministry at his church while volunteering for projects to help the\nhomeless and those less fortunate. He has continually tried to convince others to quit all\ndrug use. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\n\n4\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2b.\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nAnalysis\nDrug involvement (DI)\nThe scope and frequency of Applicant\u2019s drug use is captured in DI disqualifying\ncondition (DC) 25.a. (any drug abuse); DI DC 25.c. (illegal drug possession, including\ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of\ndrug paraphernalia), and DI DC 25.g. (any illegal drug use after being granted a security\nclearance). Applicant\u2019s interview in August 2007 (Item 6) about his drug use paints a\npicture of only weekend cocaine use. Yet, he uses words and phrases in his SCA (Item\n4) that must be interpreted as cocaine use on more than a weekend basis, but rather, to\n\n5\naddictive frequencies. His remarks about the drug indicate he enjoyed using the drug so\nhe could stay awake all night, even though he was repulsed by the resulting hangover\nthe next morning. Moreover, he used the cocaine to moderate the after effects of his\nexcessive alcohol abuse. Considering the frequency and five-year-period of time he\nused cocaine, his supposed efforts to quit cannot be given much weight, especially\nbecause of his intentional omission of his drug use in May 2003 when he submitted his\nSCA, and after June 2004 when he continued to use cocaine after he was awarded a\nsecurity clearance. \nI have carefully considered the mitigating conditions that lessen or eliminate\nsecurity concerns of drug use. Significantly, the conditions include additional factors\nbeyond simply the passage of time. Even though Applicant stresses that he\ndiscontinued his drug use after moving to the local area in December 2005, his\nintentional falsification of drug use combined with the scope and period of drug use is\nnot mitigated by DI MC 26.a. (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). His seven-year\ndrug history, characterized by cocaine use to soften the effects of excessive use of\nalcohol, did not end until October 2005. \nApplicant\u2019s drug use for seven years, and his efforts to keep his drug use from\nthe government are not excused by any of the factors listed under DI MC 26.b. [(1)\ndisassociation from drug-using associates; (2) changing or avoiding the environment\nwhere drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of abstinence; (4) a signed statement\nof intent with automatic revocation of clearance for any violation]. Because of the length\nof Applicant\u2019s drug use, his decision to try to conceal his drug use in May 2003 and\ncontinued drug use for about a year and a half after he received his security clearance\nin June 2004, a longer period of abstinence is required. \nDI MC 26.c. (abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness\nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended) does not apply,\nbut DI MC 26.d. (satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program,\nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence\nof abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional) does.\nBased on the extent of Applicant\u2019s overall drug use, and his attempt to conceal his use,\nsome kind of treatment, or corroborative evidence from members of Applicant\u2019s church,\nor a favorable prognosis from a qualified medical professional is needed to demonstrate\nApplicant has overcome his drug involvement. The DI guideline is resolved against\nApplicant. \nCriminal Conduct (CC)\nCriminal behavior creates doubt about a person\u2019s attitude toward laws, rules and\nregulations. Applicant\u2019s drug abuse from 1998 to at least October 2005 was illegal. The\nscope and frequency of his drug use, although the most abuse occurring while he was\nin college, is exacerbated by the fact that his use did not stop with marijuana, but\n\n6\nextended to more serious drugs, including ecstasy, LSD, and cocaine. Though\nApplicant admitted his drug use, his admission came after he tried to hide his drug use\nentirely. CC DC 30.a. (a single crime or multiple lesser offenses) and CC DC 30.c.\n(allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was\nformally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted) apply. \nOne mitigating condition that is potentially relevant to this case is CC MC 32.a.\n(so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under\nunusual circumstances that are unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). Though about three years\nhave passed since his drug use, he was seriously involved with drugs for more than\nseven years. CC MC 32.d. (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation, including but\nnot limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive\ncommunity involvement) recognizes Applicant\u2019s remorse for lying to the government in\nMay 2003. However, given the seriousness of his drug abuse, the lack of independent\nevidence of Applicant\u2019s job performance and religious works, I find the CC guideline\nagainst Applicant.\nPersonal Conduct (PC)\nThe primary concern of this guideline is the demonstration of dishonesty during\nthe security investigation. By answering \u201cNo\u201d to the drug question in May 2003,\nApplicant was deliberately trying to give the government the impression he had never\nused drugs before that date. Clearly he did not want the government to know about the\nseverity of his drug use and abuse. Applicant\u2019s deliberate omission of his drug use in\nMay 2003 falls within PC DC 16.a. (deliberate omission or falsification of relevant facts\nfrom a personnel security questionnaire or similar form used to conduct investigations or\naward benefits or status). \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. PC MC 17.a. (the individual made\nprompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission before being confronted with the facts)\ndoes not apply as Applicant was contacted in August 2007 to discuss his drug use. PC\nMC 17.b. (the refusal or failure to cooperate was caused or contributed to by improper\nor inadequate advice or authorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the\nindividual specifically concerning the security clearance process) does not apply as I\nbelieve Applicant withheld the truth to advance his own interests, which were to improve\nhis chances of getting employment. \nPC MC 17.c. (the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the\nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment) may apply when the offense is insignificant, or not material to the\ngovernment\u2019s decision-making process of determining security suitability. For example,\nomitting experimental drug use that hypothetically occurred more than 10 years ago\nmay be excused under PC MC 17.c. But omitting a seven-year history of regular use of\n\n7\nserious drugs remains a serious security concern that is not mitigated by the mere\npassage of time. Applicant disclosed nothing in his May 2003 security form. He did not\ndisclose his drug use until the government confronted him in August 2007. \nThe only other mitigating condition available on these facts is 17.d. (the individual\nhas acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or\ntaken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that\ncaused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is\nunlikely to recur). While Applicant has recognized his falsehoods, there is no\nindependent evidence to mitigate his deliberate omission of his drug use, or his past\nhabit of lying to suit his self interest. The PC guideline is found against Applicant. \nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nThe AG indicates the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and whole person concept. The WPC is made of nine\ngeneral policy factors:\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich the participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the\nconduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress;\nand, (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nAt the age of 21 (May 2003), Applicant deliberately omitted material information\nfrom his SCA. The government had a legitimate right to know about his drug history to\nmake an informed decision concerning his security worthiness. Instead of coming\nforward with the adverse information, he decided to remain silent about his drug use to\nenhance his chances of receiving a security clearance. He received a security\nclearance in June 2004, and continued to use cocaine at regular levels as he had done\nafter submitting his certified SCA in May 2003. Even if Applicant quit using all drugs in\nOctober 2005 as he claims, his uncorroborated religious awakening in (circa) December\n2005 does not satisfy his ultimate burden of persuasion under the DI, CC, and PC\nguidelines.   \n\n8\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Drug Involvement, Guideline H): AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2 (Criminal Conduct, Guideline H):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3 (Personal Conduct, Guideline E): \nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a.\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b.\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact3 In his SOR response, Applicant admitted responsibility for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.c (GE 8, 9) with explanations for how the debts became delinquent. He denied knowingly and deliberately falsifying his September 18, 2007, SF 86 (GE 8, 9). His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 23-year-old network engineer for a defense contractor.4 He graduated from high school in 2003 and completed one year of college (Tr. 5). 2Applicant\u2019s counsel waived Applicant\u2019s hearing on November 24, 2008 (AE A); however, Department Counsel then requested a hearing (Tr. 14; AE A). 3Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy.

One \ndebt was paid during the foreclosure process. He now has about $144,000 in delinquent \nSOR debt. The allegation that he deliberately falsified his security clearance application \nis not substantiated. Applicant mitigated personal conduct security concerns; however, \nhe failed to mitigate financial considerations security concerns. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn September 18, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigation Processing (e-QIP) or Security Clearance Application (SF 86) \n(Government Exhibit (GE) 1). On June 23, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him,1 pursuant to Executive \n \n1Government Exhibit (GE) 8 (Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated June 23, 2008). GE 8 is the \nsource for the facts in the remainder of this paragraph unless stated otherwise. \n \nDecember 10, 2008\n\n \n \n2 \n \n                                           \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, \n1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended, modified and revised. The revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, are effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. The SOR alleges \nsecurity concerns under Guidelines F (Financial Considerations) and E (Personal \nConduct). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to \nan administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, \ndenied, or revoked. \n \nOn August 18, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and requested \na hearing (GE 10).2 On September 16, 2008, DOHA amended the SOR adding an \nallegation that his condominium fee was delinquent in the amount of $2,450 (GE 10, \nSOR \u00b6 1.d). On October 21, 2008, Applicant responded to the amended SOR (GE 10). \nOn October 16, 2008, the case was assigned to me. At the hearing held on November \n25, 2008, Department Counsel offered seven exhibits (GEs 1-7) (Transcript (Tr.) 18), \nand after the hearing Applicant offered one exhibit (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE A). There \nwere no objections, and I admitted GE 1-7 (Tr. 18). Additionally, I admitted two Hearing \nNotices (GE 13, 14), the SOR (GE 8), Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR (GE 9), and two \ndocuments pertaining to Applicant\u2019s potential representation by counsel and waiver of \nhis hearing (GE 11, 12). At the hearing, I agreed to hold the record open until December \n5, 2008, to permit Applicant to provide additional documentation (Tr. 53, 60). I received \nthe transcript on December 4, 2008. I received additional documentation from Applicant \non December 5, 2008 (AE A).  \n \nFindings of Fact3 \n \nIn his SOR response, Applicant admitted responsibility for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a to 1.c (GE 8, 9) with explanations for how the debts became delinquent. He denied \nknowingly and deliberately falsifying his September 18, 2007, SF 86 (GE 8, 9). His \nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough \nreview of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.    \n \nApplicant is a 23-year-old network engineer for a defense contractor.4 He \ngraduated from high school in 2003 and completed one year of college (Tr. 5).  \n \n2Applicant\u2019s counsel waived Applicant\u2019s hearing on November 24, 2008 (AE A); however, \nDepartment Counsel then requested a hearing (Tr. 14; AE A). \n \n3Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits.    \n  \n4GE 1 (2007 security clearance application) and/or GE 9 (SOR response) are the source or \nsources for the facts in the Statement of Facts section, unless stated otherwise. \n\n \n \n3 \n \nApplicant is not married (Tr. 6). He has two children, who are ages five and three (Tr. 6). \nHis third child is due in April 2009 (Tr. 6). He lives with his domestic partner, Ms. B (Tr. \n49, GE 1).   \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR alleged three delinquent mortgage debts and a delinquent \ncondominium fee, totaling $484,137. Their current status is summarized in the table \nbelow: \n \nSOR PARAGRAPH \nAND TYPE OF \nDEBT \nAMOUNT\nSTATUS \n\u00b6 1.a Real Estate \nMortgage from H \n$88,824 \nAdmitted responsibility and currently \ndelinquent \n\u00b6 1.b Real Estate \nMortgage from A \n$335,000 \nAdmitted responsibility\u2014paid through \nforeclosure sale (Tr. 38-39, 49)  \n\u00b6 1.c Real Estate \nMortgage from H \n$57,863 \nAdmitted responsibility and currently \ndelinquent \n\u00b6 1.d Condominium \nFee-judgment \n$2,450 \nAdmitted responsibility and currently \ndelinquent \n \nOn March 15, 2006, Applicant and Ms. B, purchased a residential property (CR) \nand took a mortgage with Y, No. 5636XXXX for $224,000 with $1,323 monthly \npayments (GE 7 at 27, 28). The last payment was made in May 2007 (GE 7 at 29-39). \nIn July 2005, they borrowed $56,000 on CR, Account No. 730364XXXX  (GE 7 at 4, 40).  \nThe last payment was made in May 2007 (GE 7 at 40-42). The delinquent account for \n$224,000 was not listed on the SOR (Tr. 48-49); however, the delinquent 2nd trust for \nabout $56,000 was listed on the SOR (GE 9). Applicant disclosed both delinquent \naccounts in response to interrogatories (GE 7 at 1). He thought the lender received \nabout $170,000 from the auction, leaving about a $100,000 loss (Tr. 39). Applicant did \nnot contact the creditors after the foreclosure about making payment arrangements (Tr. \n46-47). \n \nApplicant\u2019s real estate loans relating to CR were in good standing for two years \nas they used the CR property as their primary residence. Then Applicant and Ms. B \nmoved and rented the CR property. The rent they received was supposed to be \nsufficient to pay CR\u2019s mortgages. Applicant\u2019s tenant failed to pay the rent, and Applicant \nand Ms. B evicted their tenant. Applicant and Ms. B obtained a judgment against the \ntenant for two months\u2019 overdue rent. However, the tenant did not pay the judgment. \nApplicant\u2019s January 27, 2008, credit report showed the past due amount as $2,540 on \nthe $57,863 mortgage (GE 3).        \n \nApplicant and Ms. B purchased an investment, residential property (FF) because \ntheir real estate agent convinced them they could resell the property in a few months \nand realize a profit (Tr. 35, GE 7 at 8, GE 9 at 1). On September 27, 2006, they \nborrowed $335,000 from \u201cA,\u201d Acct No. 00336XXXX to finance the property (GE 7 at 4, \n\n \n \n4 \n \n                                           \n44). They made their last payment in May 2007 (GE 7 at 44). Monthly payments were \n$2,299 (GE 7 at 44). On November 6, 2007, the lender foreclosed on FF (GE 7 at 4). \nApplicant believed the sale completely repaid the first mortgage, but did not pay any of   \nthe second mortgage (Tr. 38-39, 49).  \n \nOn January 1, 2007, they borrowed $83,654 with the FF property5 as collateral \nfrom H, Account No. 730621XXXX and monthly payments of $690 (GE 1, GE 7 at 4, 46, \nGE 9). Applicant\u2019s January 27, 2008, credit report showed the past due amount as \n$5,191 on the $88,824 mortgage (GE 3). Applicant has not contacted the creditor after \nthe November 6, 2007, foreclosure about making payment arrangements (Tr. 46-47). \n \nOn March 5, 2007, Applicant became unemployed (Tr. 25) and his girlfriend \nassumed responsibility for payment of their mortgages (GE 7 at 3, GE 9 at 2). He was \nhired at a real estate firm on May 22, 2007, to assist with information technology (Tr. 25, \nGE 7 at 3). Ms. B became unemployed in June 2007 (Tr. 26, GE 7 at 3). On August 27, \n2007, Ms. B was hired (Tr. 26). In September 2007, Applicant began working for a \ndefense contractor (Tr. 27, GE 7 at 3).    \n \nOn June 19, 2008, a creditor obtained a judgment for $2,450 for a condominium \nfee (GE 5). On September 16, 2008, Applicant said he intended to pay this debt (GE 10 \nat 2). As of his hearing date on November 25, 2008, he had not contacted the creditor \nor paid anything towards this debt (Tr. 42-44). \n \nApplicant has two mortgages with C on his present residence, one for $110,448 \nwith a monthly payment of $844 and the other for $443,874 with a monthly payment of \n$2,316 (GE 7 at 19-20).  As of February 2008, these two mortgages were current (Tr. \n24, 36-37, GE 7 at 19-20). \n \nPersonal Conduct (Guideline E) \n    \n \nApplicant completed his SF86 on September 18, 2007. He disclosed two types of \nderogatory information. He admitted that he left two jobs under adverse circumstances \n(GE 1 at Section 22). He also disclosed that he used marijuana five times from February \n2003 to August 2004 (GE 1 at Section 24). In response to Section 28 he answered, \u201cNo\u201d \non his SF 86 to two questions that are relevant to the issue of whether Applicant \nfalsified his SF 86, \u201cYour Financial Delinquencies-90 Days Are you currently over 90 \ndays delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d  \n \nApplicant denied knowing his mortgage accounts were delinquent when he \ncompleted his SF 86 (Tr. 20, 22-23). Ms. B was responsible for making sure all debts \nand accounts were paid and current (Tr. 23). Ms. B worked with the real estate agent \nwho handled the renter and the resale of the FF property (Tr. 30). She was making \n \n5 Applicant\u2019s SOR response and hearing statement indicates this loan used the CR property as \ncollateral; however, I conclude that the FF property was the collateral for this loan. Compare Tr. 29 and \nGE 9 at 1 with GE 7 at 4, 46 (account statement). \n\n \n \n5 \n \n$12,000 to $15,000 in the mortgage business (Tr. 31). She worked in the mortgage \nbusiness for seven years and Applicant trusted her judgment and expertise (Tr. 36). Ms. \nB told him their accounts were fine and all caught up or current (Tr. 21, 31-32). She \nbecame angry if he was too inquisitive about the status of their investments (Tr. 32). \nShe is very secretive about the status of their bills (Tr. 34). Ms. B is the primary name \non the delinquent accounts (Tr. 21). She maintains a separate account with her funds \n(Tr. 32-33). There was silence between them about their debts and their relationship \nbecame strained (Tr. 50). He first learned about the financial problems in October 2007, \nwhen he heard from his mortgage holder on his residence (Tr. 20). Immediately after \ndiscovering the accounts were delinquent, he disclosed the delinquency to his employer \n(Tr. 21-22). However, he could not remember the name of the person he told about his \ndebt problem (Tr. 38). His employer advised him to wait until the Department of Defense \ncontacted him about his debts (Tr. 22).  He had a full discussion with Ms. B about the \ndebts when he received the DOHA interrogatories in March 2008 (Tr. 50-51, GE 7)  \n \nMs. B provided a statement indicating when they owned three residences she \nearned $10,000 to $15,000 monthly and Applicant earned about $2,200 (AE A at 1). Her \nexpertise was in mortgage lending, and she was responsible for paying the mortgages \n(AE A at 1). When Applicant was out of work in 2007, there was little communication \nbetween Ms. B and Applicant because Applicant was depressed and moody (AE A at \n1). When he started his new employment, she still did not tell him about the delinquent \ndebts because she did not want to upset him (AE A at 2). She lied to Applicant \nrepeatedly about the status of their debts and always reassured him that their \ninvestments were doing fine (AE A at 2). After Applicant was already working for a \ngovernment contractor she told him about the delinquent mortgages (AE A at 2-3).  \n  \nPolicies \n \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Id. at \n527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n\n \n \n6 \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended \nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould potentially raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d  \n \nApplicant\u2019s three delinquent debts are well documented. Three of the large debts \nlisted in the statement of reasons are not paid or in payment plans. They total \napproximately $148,000 and are currently delinquent. They became delinquent in 2007, \nwhich is too recent to constitute a lengthy history of delinquent debt and AG \u00b6 19(a) \ndoes not apply. He has provided insufficient documentation to show progress resolving \nthese three debts. The government established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6 \n19(c).   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n\n \n \n8 \n \n                                           \nApplicant receives partial credit under AG \u00b6 19(b) because three conditions \ncausing financial problems were largely beyond his control. First, his difficult relationship \nwith Ms. B in connection with their finances caused problems. Ms. B\u2019s lack of \ncommunication about their finances as well as her control of their investments and debt \npayments made it difficult for Applicant to intervene when their financial problems became \nworse. Second, both Applicant and his wife were briefly unemployed in 2007. Third, the \nwidespread deflation in residential real estate has caused many investors to lose money \nand generated substantial delinquent debt. He does not receive full credit because he did \nnot act responsibly under the circumstances. After he and Ms. B\u2019s returned to full \nemployment, they had the means to address their delinquent debt. He did not \ncommunicate with his creditors, attempt to arrange a payment plan, or file for bankruptcy. \nAll three debts remain as delinquent and unresolved as they were when Applicant was \nnotified of their security significance upon the receipt of the SOR.   \n \nApplicant did not provide evidence of financial counseling and he did not dispute \nthe SOR debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(c) and 19(e) do not apply. \n \nApplicant did not establish that he made a good faith effort to repay the three \ndelinquent debts, or otherwise attempt to resolve them to a sufficient degree to mitigate \nthem. There is insufficient information to establish that Applicant showed good faith6 in \nthe resolution of his delinquent SOR debts because he did not establish that his failure to \npay the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c and 1.d was reasonable and necessary under the \ncircumstances. He did not provide sufficient information to establish that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or made sufficient efforts to address his delinquent \ndebts especially those debts which accrued after being notified they were a security \nconcern when the SOR was delivered to him.7  \n \n6The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n7\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \n\n \n \n9 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are continuing and likely to recur. He should have \nbeen more diligent, providing documentation showing greater, more timely efforts to \nresolve his three delinquent debts. He has not carried his burden of proving his financial \nresponsibility. There are not clear indications his three delinquent debts are being \nresolved. His overall conduct with these creditors casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment, and I conclude no mitigating conditions fully apply. \n \nPersonal Conduct (Guideline E) \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative. \n \nApplicant\u2019s September 18, 2007, SF 86 asked about Applicant\u2019s delinquent debt. \nHe answered, \u201cNo,\u201d and did not disclose the debts discussed in the previous section. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) apply. \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns in this case: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n                                                                                                                                             \nwhether he or she maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \n\n \n \n10 \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \nAs indicated previously, Applicant\u2019s answers about his delinquent debts were not \ndeliberately false because he was unaware of his delinquent debts. Ms. B concealed \nthe delinquent debts from him and I find his denials of knowledge about these debts to \nbe credible. He disclosed other derogatory information concerning terminations of \nemployment and drug use. The allegations about providing a false answer about his \ncurrently delinquent debts are unsubstantiated and therefore mitigated under AG \u00b6 \n17(f). \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount \nconcern. The adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in \nconsidering the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by \nthe totality of his or her acts, omissions, and motivations as well as various other \nvariables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all \nrelevant circumstances and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful \nanalysis.  Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1:  \n\n \n \n11 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the \nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3, \u201cThe ultimate determination of whether the granting or \ncontinuing of eligibility for a security clearance is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security must be an overall common sense determination based upon careful \nconsideration\u201d of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nThere is some evidence tending to mitigate Applicant\u2019s conduct under the whole \nperson concept. Applicant is 23 years old and is not sophisticated about his finances. \nHe allowed his domestic partner, Ms. B, to handle their investments and pay their debts. \nHe was unaware of his financial problems until after he signed his SF 86 and the two \nproperties were already repossessed. Like thousands of other investors caught when \nthe real estate bubble burst in 2007, he is not culpable for making what turned out to be \nin hindsight poor real estate investments. An important positive financial development is \nhis mortgage on his own residence is current, and he is now communicating with his \ndomestic partner about financial issues. His dedication to his work, his family and his \ncountry is a very positive indication of his good character and trustworthiness. He is \ncompletely loyal to the United States. There is no evidence of any security violation, or \ncriminal activity. His non-SOR debts are current and being paid. These factors show \nsome responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation.  \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept and the adjudicative \nguidelines is not sufficient to warrant access to classified information at this time. He \nhas not made any payments on the three delinquent SOR debts. The overall amount of \nunresolved delinquent SOR debt is about $144,000, which is substantial. About \n$142,000 of this debt resulted from foreclosures of two properties in 2007. His financial \nirresponsibility is shown by his failure to contact his creditors after the mortgages were \nforeclosed about making payment plans. He and Ms. B have the income to enter into \npayment plans on at least one debt, had ample time to begin payment plans and \nestablish a track record of responsibility on these debts and yet have chosen not to take \nthese steps. In sum, he failed to establish that he acted financially responsibly after he \nbecame fully employed and received the SOR with respect to his delinquent debts.  \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

His eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(EQIP) on July 30, 2007. He completed and signed a Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive \nPositions (SF-85) on May 31, 2005 and August 3, 2005. On June 5, 2008, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement. The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nOctober 30, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nOn June 30, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 19, \n2008. I convened a hearing on September 24, 2008, to consider whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant.  The Government called no witnesses and introduced six exhibits, which \nwere marked Ex. 1 through 6 and admitted to the record without objection.  Applicant \ntestified on his own behalf, called one witness, and introduced three exhibits, which \nwere marked Exs. A, B, and C.  Applicant\u2019s exhibits were admitted to the record without \nobjection.  \n \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on October 2, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains three allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG H, Drug \nInvolvement (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.c.). In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted \nthe three allegations and provided additional information. Applicant\u2019s admissions are \nadmitted as findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is 29 years old, never married, and employed as an information \ntechnology consultant by a government contractor. In 2001, he earned a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree.  He first went to work for his present employer in 2003.  In 2005, he resigned to \nattend graduate school.  In November 2006, he was rehired by his employer.   (Ex. 1; \nTr. 39-40.) \n \n \nA project manager from Applicant\u2019s employer testified as a witness for Applicant.  \nHe stated that he had known Applicant professionally since August 2007, and he \nobserved that Applicant was dependable, hardworking, even tempered, and respectful.  \nApplicant\u2019s witness testified that on the day before his due process hearing, Applicant \ndiscussed with him the reasons for the government\u2019s concern about Applicant\u2019s security \nworthiness. (Tr. 25-27.) \n \n \nIn 1998, when he was about 19 years old and a college sophomore, Applicant \nbegan to use marijuana. For eight years, between 1998 and September 2006, Applicant \nused marijuana approximately 186 times. Between 2002 and 2004, he used cocaine \napproximately four times.  He used ecstasy one time in 1999.  Applicant avers he has \nnot used illegal drugs for two years and will never use illegal drugs again. (Tr. 42-45; \nEx. 1 at 44; Ex. 3 at 7.) \n \n \nApplicant sought psychological counseling in 1999, and he continued in weekly \npsychotherapy sessions for nine years.  During that time, he discussed his drug use \nwith his therapist, but did not recall his therapist advising him not to use drugs.  His use \nof cocaine and ecstasy occurred in the company of others.  While he used marijuana \nwith others, he also used it when alone for relaxation and to control anxiety or \nnervousness.  He denied purchasing drugs.  (Tr. 48, 61-63, 70-74.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nIn the summer of 2002, Applicant moved in with a friend who introduced him to \ncocaine. In the company of this friend, Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana increased. His \nfriends supplied him with marijuana.  In 2004, a coworker gave him marijuana.  (Tr. 74-\n77.) \n \n \nApplicant admitted he used illegal drugs until September 2006. He stated that he \nstopped using illegal drugs in September 2006. He stated he no longer associated with \nthe individuals with whom he had used illegal drugs. He also stated he had found ways \nto cope with stress that did not involve illegal drug use. In his answer to interrogatories \nfrom DOHA, he said he stopped using marijuana because drug use was incompatible \nwith his core values, and he prided himself on being an honest and law-abiding person.  \nAt his hearing, he defined his core values as \u201ckindness, empathy, understanding, \nhonesty, integrity, trustworthiness . . . [and] abiding by the law.\u201d  (Tr. 48, 56, 77-78, 82-\n83; Ex. 3 at 7-8.) \n \n \nIn 2005, Applicant completed a SF-85.  Question 14 on the SF-85 reads, in \npertinent part, as follows:  \n \nIn the last year, have you used, possessed, supplied, or manufactured \nillegal drugs?  When used without a prescription, illegal drugs include \nmarijuana, cocaine, hashish, narcotics (opium, morphine, codeine, heroin, \netc.), stimulants (cocaine, amphetamines, etc.), depressants (barbiturates, \nmethaqualone, tranquilizers, etc.), hallucinogenics (LSD, PCP, etc.) \n(NOTE: Neither your truthful response nor information derived from your \nresponse will be used as evidence against you in any subsequent criminal \nproceeding.) \n \n  \nApplicant responded \u201cno\u201d to Question 14. On August 3, 2005, he signed and \ncertified the following statement about his answers on the SF-85: \u201cMy statements on \nthis form, and any attachments to it, are true, complete, and correct to the best of my \nknowledge and belief and are made in good faith. I understand that a knowing and \nwillful false statement on this form can punished by fine or imprisonment or both. (See \nsection 1001 of title 18, United States Code.)\u201d \n(Ex. 2 at 5.)  \n \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant explained his answer to Question 14 as follows: \n \nUnfortunately, I chose to lie on that occasion because I was afraid of \nlosing my job. I did not understand, and no one had explained to me, \nexactly what the ramifications would be if I was truthful, and I was very \nafraid that if I answered \u201cyes\u201d that [I] would be terminated.  So in that case, \nthat concern overrode, you know, my principle [of] being honest. \n(Tr. 84.) \n \n \nFalsification of his SF-85 was not alleged on the SOR. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                         Policies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness because it may impair judgment and \nbecause it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations.  AG \u00b6 24(a) defines drugs as \u201cmood and behavior altering \nsubstances.\u201d  The definition of drugs includes \u201c(1) drugs, materials, and other chemical \ncompounds identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended \n(e.g., marijuana or cannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), \nand (2) inhalants and other similar substances.\u201d AG  \u00b6 24(b) defines drug abuse as \u201cthe \nillegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved \nmedical direction.\u201d \n \nThe relevant Guideline H security concern in this case is referenced at AG \u00b6 \n25(a) of the Drug Involvement guideline.  The record shows that Applicant\u2019s admitted \nillegal use of marijuana began in about 1998, when he was 19 years old and continued \nuntil 2006, when he was 27 years old. During that time he also used cocaine four times \nand ecstasy one time. He used illegal drugs while employed by a federal contractor. \nThis conduct casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.  It also \nraises security concerns about his ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.  I conclude that Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use raises security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 24 and AG \u00b6 25(a). \n \nSeveral Guideline H mitigating conditions might apply to the facts of Applicant\u2019s \ncase.  If Applicant\u2019s drug use happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, then AG \u00b6 26(a) might be \napplicable in mitigation.  If Applicant demonstrated an intent not to abuse any drugs in \nthe future by disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts, changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used, abstaining from drug use for an \nappropriate period, and signing a statement of intent with the automatic revocation of \nhis security clearance for any violation, then AG \u00b6 26(b) might be applicable.  \n \nThe record shows that Applicant\u2019s drug use is not recent, but it is of sufficient \nduration to demonstrate a consistent lifestyle choice. His illegal drug use began when \nhe was a sophomore in college and continued in his post-college and professional life \nuntil two years ago, when he was 27 years old.  While Applicant stated he had not used \nmarijuana since September 2006, he failed to provide evidence corroborating his \nstatement about his abstinence from friends and others who knew him socially. \nApplicant stated he had changed his behavior and activities after his last use of \nmarijuana in September 2006 and his subsequent decision to abstain from illegal drugs. \nThese decisions are still somewhat recent and the lifestyle change is of insufficient \nduration to demonstrate a positive and permanent change in behavior. I conclude that \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) do not fully apply in mitigation to the security concerns raised by \nthe facts in Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant himself provided \ninformation about his drug use that was alleged on the SOR. His one-time use of \necstasy in 1999 was an isolated use of that illegal drug. He has expressed an intent to \npermanently abstain from illegal drugs in the future, and his manager was positive in his \nevaluation of Applicant\u2019s professional skills. \n \n \nI have also considered the Applicant\u2019s falsification of Question 14 on his SF-85 \nas a part of this whole person analysis. Conduct not alleged in the SOR may be \nconsidered: A(a) to assess an applicant=s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant=s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether \nan applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a \nparticular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide \nevidence for whole person analysis under Directive Section 6.3.@ ISCR Case No. 03-\n20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (citations omitted). Additionally, the Appeal Board \nhas determined that even though crucial security concerns are not alleged in the SOR, \nthe Judge may consider those security concerns when they are relevant and factually \nrelated to a disqualifying condition that was alleged in the SOR.  ISCR 05-01820 at 3 \nn.4 (App. Bd. Dec. 14, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-18860 at 8 (App. Bd. Mar. 17, \n2003) and ISCR Case No. 02-00305 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 12, 2003)). I conclude that \nApplicant\u2019s deliberate falsification of his drug use on his SF-85 and his expressed \nmotivation for the falsification occurred when he was a mature adult. (AG \u00b6 2(a)(4). His \nmotivation for the falsification raises concerns about his credibility, trustworthiness, and \n\n \n7 \n \n \nability to put the government\u2019s interests before his own in the protection of classified \ninformation.  AG \u00b6 2(a)(7).  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his \ndrug involvement.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He has held a security clearance since 1985. He is now working two full time jobs for different defense contractors supporting the Department of Defense. He has been married and divorced twice and has two children and is paying child support. He is a high school graduate but has taken courses to receive technical certifications (Gov. Ex. 1, e-QIP, dated March 30, 2006). Applicant was in and out of full and part time work for various defense contractors because of the nature of government contracts and the working of government contractors. When he completed the security clearance application in March 2006, he was working full-time for Q and part-time for L. Q lost a government contract in October 2006, and Applicant lost his employment with Q. He was still working part-time for L. He applied for and drew state unemployment because he was no longer employed full-time. He continued to work part-time for L and other contractors until December 2007 when he started full-time employment with C. C lost the government contract he was working on in March 2008.

On May 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns for \nApplicant for financial considerations under Guideline F. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June \n30, 2008. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 14, 2008.  He admitted nine of the \nten allegations, and denied one as being a duplicate of an admitted allegation.  He \nprovided detailed information concerning his financial situation, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nAugust 25, 2008.  The case was assigned to me on August 26, 2008.  DOHA issued a \n \n1 \n \n \nOctober 28, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nnotice of hearing on September 2, 2008, for a hearing on October 7, 2008.  I convened \nthe hearing as scheduled.  The government offered four exhibits, marked government \nexhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1-4 received without objection.  Applicant testified on his own behalf, \nand submitted two Applicant exhibits marked App. Ex. A-B received without objection.  \nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on October 10, 2008.  Based upon a \nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is 48 years old and has worked as a technology systems administrator \nfor a number of government contactors supporting government agencies.  He has held \na security clearance since 1985.  He is now working two full time jobs for different \ndefense contractors supporting the Department of Defense.  He has been married and \ndivorced twice and has two children and is paying child support.  He is a high school \ngraduate but has taken courses to receive technical certifications (Gov. Ex. 1, e-QIP, \ndated March 30, 2006).  \n \nApplicant was in and out of full and part time work for various defense \ncontractors because of the nature of government contracts and the working of \ngovernment contractors.  When he completed the security clearance application in \nMarch 2006, he was working full-time for Q and part-time for L.  Q lost a government \ncontract in October 2006, and Applicant lost his employment with Q.  He was still \nworking part-time for L.  He applied for and drew state unemployment because he was \nno longer employed full-time.  He continued to work part-time for L and other \ncontractors until December 2007 when he started full-time employment with C.  C lost \nthe government contract he was working on in March 2008.  He only worked part-time \nagain until May 2008 when he received a full-time position with L.  Part-time \nemployment meant that the number of hours he worked in a week varied depending on \nthe needs of the employer.  Some times he worked a full 40 hour work week, \nsometimes less.  Applicant is now working two full-time jobs having started a full-time \nposition with employer K on September 29, 2008 (Tr. 42-50; App. Ex. A, Employment \nLetter, dated September 28, 2008).  His monthly pay with L is $3,600, and he \nanticipates receiving about $4,000 monthly with K (monthly base pay is $7,083).  He \nhas about $4,000 in monthly expenses which will leave him with discretionary or \ndisposable income of about $3,500 per month starting in October 2008 (Tr. 52-53, 63-\n65). \n \nThe SOR lists 10 allegations of delinquent debts of financial considerations \nsecurity concern.  These include a medical debt in collection for $440 (SOR 1.a); a \ncredit card debt charged off for $4,388 (SOR 1.b); a jewelry store account charged off \nas a bad debt for $4,937 (SOR 1.c); a bank credit card account charged off as a bad \ndebt for $10,500 (SOR 1.d); another credit card debt charged off as a bad debt for \n$35,457 (SOR 1.e); another credit card account in collection for $14,077 (SOR 1.f); a \ndebt to a state government agency for unemployment insurance of $2,082 (SOR 1.g); \nanother credit card account in collection for $12,804 (SOR 1.h); a credit union account \n\n \n3 \n \n \nin collection for $23,273 (SOR 1.i); and another credit union account charged off as a \nbad debt for $2,696 (SOR 1.j).  The total amount of the debt is about $97,000 (Tr. 17-\n18; See, Gov. Ex. 3, Credit Report, dated March 8, 2008; and Gov. Ex. 4, Credit Report, \ndated April 21, 2006).  Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR except 1.d \nwhich he stated is a duplicate of allegation 1.h.   \n \nApplicant married his first wife in 1989.  They had two children who are now 16 \nand 18 years old.  During their marriage, he was basically able to cover the family \nexpenses by working two jobs.  He and his wife separated in 2002.  His wife became ill \nand could not keep up with her expenses.  Applicant took out about $40,000 in loans \nand credit cards to support his family.  His wife received the family car, a Cadillac \nEscalade with a car loan note originally for $65,000, which she has subsequently paid \noff.  Applicant does not know how she paid the car off.  Applicant and his first wife \ndivorced in 2005 and he married again in December 2005.  He has a step-child from his \nsecond wife and they have a two-year-old child together.  Applicant and his second wife \nseparated about one year ago.  Applicant now lives with his father.  He pays $2,000 a \nmonth in child support as well as $400 to his father for room and board (Tr. 31-35).   \n \nApplicant has a debt to a hospital for $440.  He reached an agreement with the \nhospital to pay the debt in two monthly installments of $220.  The hospital would not \nprovide him with any documents on the agreement but told him just to pay.  Applicant \nclaims he made one payment of $220 in September 2008 and the other payment is due \non October 15, 2008.  He did not provide any documentation of payment (Tr. 19-21, \nSee Case file, Answer to SOR, dated July 14, 2008, at exhibit 3) \n \nApplicant entered an agreement with a credit counseling company on March 20, \n2008, to assist him with paying seven of his delinquent debts.  Included in this \nagreement are the credit card debt of $4,388 (SOR 1.b), the jewelry store debt of \n$4,937 (SOR 1.c), the loan of $12,804 (SOR 1d and duplicate 1.h), the bank loan of \n$35,457 (SOR 1.e), the delinquent credit card account of $14,077 (SOR 1.f), the credit \nunion account for $23,273 (SOR 1.i), and another credit union account of $2,989 (SOR \n1.j) (App. Ex B, credit counseling agreement, dated March 20, 2008 at 13).  The \nagreement requires Applicant to pay the credit counseling agency $937.24 monthly for \nfive months which goes to the credit counseling agency for administrative expenses.  \nThese payments have been made.  For the next year, Applicant pays the credit \ncounseling agency $846, of which $585.77 is for administrative expenses and $260.23 \nfor debt relief.  Applicant will continue to pay the credit counseling agency $846 per \nmonth for 24 more months.  All of these payments will go to debt relief (Tr. 26-30; App. \nEx. B, Credit Counseling Contract, dated March 20, 2008 at 12).  Applicant's total debt \nis approximately $97,000.  The total amount of payment for debt reduction under the \nplan with the credit counseling agency is about $39,500.  Applicant is not aware of any \narrangement the credit counseling agency made with creditors to settle any debt for less \nthan the amount of the debt (Tr. 30-31). \n \nApplicant admits he owes a state unemployment commission $2,082 for \noverpayment of unemployment insurance (SOR 1.g).  Applicant was laid off from his full \n\n \n4 \n \n \ntime position in 2006 and claimed unemployment compensation.  At the time, he was \nstill working part-time.  He neglected to inform the unemployment commission of his \npart-time employment.  After learning of the part-time employment, the state placed in \ncollection the amount of the difference.  Applicant recently made an agreement to pay \nthe state $100 monthly until the debt is settled.  He made his first payment in \nSeptember 2008.  The state agency did not send Applicant a written agreement but told \nhim just to pay the debt.  Applicant does not have a formal agreement with the agency \nto repay the debt at $100 monthly (Tr. 23-25).   \n \nApplicant recently purchased a new car for $32,000 increasing his monthly car \npayment to $643.  As previously noted, his wife had a five year car loan note for \n$65,000 that has been paid. Applicant does not know how his wife paid the car loan (Tr. \n37-40).  Applicant just recently filed his 2005, 2006, and 2007 state and federal tax \nreturns.  He did not file for an extension.  He did not file earlier because he did not have \nthe resources to pay any taxes owed.  Applicant states that his taxes were recently filed \nby an accountant.  Applicant is not sure when the taxes were filed for him and if he \nowes taxes or will receive a refund.  If he owes taxes, he does not have the resources \nto pay them (Tr. 55-62). \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n\n \n5 \n \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Consideration: \n \n \nUnder financial considerations, failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 18)  Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to \nprotect classified information.  Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms.  Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance.  An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations.  Credit reports and Applicant's admissions show that Applicant has \nsignificant delinquent debts.  Applicant accumulated the debts because he was unable \nto pay his financial obligations.  He has only recently addressed the debts but has not \nsettled or completely resolved them.  Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are a security \nconcern raising Financial Consideration Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \u00b6 19(a) \n\"inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\", and FC DC \u00b6 19(c) \"a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations.\"   \n \n \nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) \"the behavior \nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.\" does not apply.  Applicant presented no information \nto establish that any of the debts have been paid.  He only recently entered payment \n\n \n6 \n \n \nplans to pay the debts.  All of the debts are current debts.  There are a number of \ndelinquent debts from various sources such as credit cards, jewelry purchases, bank \nloans, car loans, and medical bills so Applicant accumulates delinquent debts \nfrequently.  Other than the fact Applicant was divorced, he raised no unique \ncircumstances causing the debts.  The delinquent debts are likely to recur.  The current \nunpaid debts cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.  \n \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(b) \"the conditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances\" has to be considered under the \ncircumstances.  Applicant divorced and had to pay child support.  He was not working \nfull-time all of the time but was working part-time all of the time.  Part-time employment \nmeant the hours he worked depended on the needs of his employer.  Sometimes it was \nfull time, sometimes less than full time.  Applicant has not established that the divorce \nand child support payments significantly increase his expenses.  He was receiving \nsome pay during this entire time and could have made some payments on his debts.  \nHe has not indicated any change in behavior because of the divorce and his only part-\ntime employment.  Accordingly, he has not established that he acted responsibly toward \nhis debts under the circumstances.  The mitigating condition has not been established \nby Applicant. \n \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(a) \"the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol\" applies.  Applicant sought and received counseling from a credit counseling \nagency and they assist him in managing the payment of his delinquent debts.  He is \nfollowing the plan. \n \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(d) \"the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to repay the \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\" has limited application.  For FC MC \u00b6 \n20(d) to apply, there must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \n\u201cevidence\u201d of a good-faith effort to repay.  A systematic, concrete method of handling \ndebts is needed.  Applicant recently entered three plans to pay all of his debts.  He has \nbeen making payments for the last six months on seven of his debts using a credit \ncounseling agency.  He has made a payment each on the two debts not covered under \nthe agreement.  An applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to act \nresponsibly in regard to his finances.  He is now making a good-faith effort to pay debts \nbecause of his payments to the credit counseling agency, the hospital, and the state \nunemployment commission.  \n \n \u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \n\n \n7 \n \n \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  I considered Applicant has held a \ntop level security clearance for almost 30 years.  Applicant recently made arrangements \nto pay debts and has been paying them.  He is working two jobs to earn sufficient funds \nto pay his debts.  If he continues on his plan, he will be able to pay his debts.  However, \nApplicant has also been irresponsible towards his finances.  At a time when his income \nis low and his expenses are high, Applicant purchased a new vehicle increasing the \namount of monthly car payments.  Applicant does not know if a tax accountant filed \nApplicant's state and federal tax returns funds for the last three years.  He does not \nknow if a request for extension was filed.  Applicant did not have full knowledge of the \nstatus of his last three year federal and state income taxes.  Applicant's irresponsible \nmanagement of his finances does indicate he may be irresponsible toward the handling \nof classified information in spite of the fact he held a security clearance for over 30 \nyears.  On balance, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns arising from financial considerations.   \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n8 \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \nFor Applicant (Duplicate) \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

(Tr. 68, \n70)  \n \nIn February 2001, while a junior in college, Applicant underwent surgery for a \nshoulder injury; a torn ligament. (Tr. 62-63) He was prescribed hydrocodone for the \npain. From April 2002 to March 2005, he used hydrocodone 15 to 20 times in a \nrecreational, unauthorized manner. He would take a pill with a couple of beers, which \ngave a relaxed, jovial, and mellow effect. He thought the combination of the drug and \nalcohol would amplify the alcohol\u2019s effect. (Tr. 94) In late 2002 or early 2003, Applicant \nsold the remainder of his prescription, approximately ten pills, to a friend for $20. (Tr. \n64-65, Ex. 4)  \n \nTwo years ago he was offered hydrocodone. He informed the individual he was \nnot interested in using it or being around it. He then left the area. (Tr. 89) Applicant does \nnot associate with the individual who bought the hydrocodone, nor does he associate \nwith individuals using illegal drugs. (Tr. 76, Ex. 3) Drug use is inconsistent with his \ncurrent life goals. (Tr. 90)  \n \nguidelines (AG) approved by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of \nDefense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n\n \n \n \n3\nFrom March 2001 to September 2003, Applicant used Ritalin 15 times in an \nunauthorized manner. College friends had prescriptions for Ritalin. Before attending \nfraternity parties, Applicant would take a pill, mixing the drug and alcohol to enhance the \neffect of the alcohol. (Ex. 4) It made him feel anxious, excited, and uninhibited. It \nheightened his awareness and made him more outgoing. (Tr. 95) From December 2001 \nto February 2004, he used psychedelic mushrooms on three occasions. (Tr. 66) At the \ntime of his last use, he was still living at his fraternity house and was offered the \nmushrooms by another fraternity member. (Tr. 66-67) In October 2002, Applicant tried \nLSD once at his fraternity house and did not like it. It had an acute effect on sound and \nmade it more difficult to put thoughts together. (Tr. 70, Ex. 4) \n \n \nIn February 2000, Applicant the age 18 or 19 was charged with disorderly \nconduct and paid a $90 fine. Applicant and a pizza parlor employee got into an \naltercation after three pizzas were knocked onto the floor. (Tr. 55, Ex. 4) In September \n2003, he was charged with criminal mischief. He was with a group of eight friends who \nwere leaving a bar when a window was broken. One of the group claimed responsibility \nfor the damage. The charge against Applicant was dismissed. (Tr. 57, Ex. 4) He has \nnever been arrested on drug-related charges.  \n \nIn March 2005, while on a trip to Jamaica, Applicant used cocaine. (Tr. 61, Ex. 4) \nApplicant and a friend used some cocaine they had purchased and threw out the rest. \nHe was not interested in trying it again and did not want to have it in the room due to the \nrisk it posed. (Tr. 62) In August 2005, he used hashish once while on vacation with \nfriends in Morocco, which was his last illegal drug use. (Ex. 4) \n \n It is Applicant\u2019s intent to never use illegal drugs again. (Tr. 78, Ex. M) He asserts \nhe has changed and matured during the last several years assuming greater \nresponsibility for charting his life. He takes responsibility for his actions and understands \nthe consequences. Illegal drug use is inconsistent with his plans for the future and what \nhe hopes to accomplish in his life. (Tr. 76, Ex. 3) Applicant realizes how stupid his \ndecision was to use marijuana and what he was risking.  \n \nApplicant listed all of his illegal drug use on his January 2007 Electronic \nQuestionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (Ex. 1) and his Standard Form \n(SF) 86, Questionnaire for Sensitive Positions. (Ex. 2) He also listed his usage in his \nresponse to interrogatories. (Ex. 3)  \n \nApplicant has $10,000 in his current company\u2019s 401(k) retirement plan (Ex. I) and \napproximately $11,000 in a previous employer\u2019s retirement account. (Ex. J) He has \nmore than $53,000 in his savings account (Ex. K) and pays his debts in a timely \nmanner. (Ex. L) Applicant signed a statement of intent agreeing to automatic revocation \nof his security clearance should he ever use illegal drugs again. (Ex. M)  \n \n \nPolicies \n\n \n \n \n4\n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n\n \n \n \n5\n \nDrug Involvement \n \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: Use of \nan illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about an individual's \nreliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair judgment and because it \nraises questions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: \n \n(a) any drug abuse; \n \n(b) testing positive for illegal drug use; \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; \n \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, \nclinical psychologist, or psychiatrist) of drug abuse or drug dependence; \n \n(e) evaluation of drug abuse or drug dependence by a licensed clinical \nsocial worker who, is a staff member of a recognized drug treatment \nprogram; \n \n(f) failure to successfully complete a drug treatment program prescribed by \na duly qualified medical professional; \n \n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance; and \n \n(h) expressed intent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and \nconvincingly commit to discontinue drug use. \n \nApplicant used marijuana following high school graduation and during his \nsophomore and junior year in college. He also used: psychedelic mushrooms on three \noccasions, with his last using in 2004; used LSD once in 2002; used hashish once in \n2005; and used cocaine once in 2005. He also used Ritalin and hydrocodone in an \nunauthorized manner using it recreationally by mixing it with alcohol. In sold the \nremainder of his hydrocodone prescription in late 2002 or early 2003.  \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a) drug use and AG \u00b6 25(c) purchase and sale apply.  \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n\n \n \n \n6\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as:  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence; and, \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation; \n \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand, \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding but not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n  \n \nApplicant last use of any illegal drug occurred in 2005. The majority of his use \noccurred while in college living in a fraternity house. The only illegal drug use not related \nto his fraternity involvement was his hashish use while on vacation in Morocco in August \n2005 and his cocaine use in March 2005. Each use was a single use.  \n \nApplicant intends to never use illegal drugs again. In October 2008, he signed an \naffidavit stating he would submit to drug testing and any drug use would result in the \nloss of his clearance. He has changed, matured, and assumed greater responsibility for \nthe course of his life. He takes responsibility for his actions and understands the \nconsequences. Illegal drug use is inconsistent with his plans for the future and what he \nhopes to accomplish in his life. He realizes how stupid his decision was to use illegal \ndrugs and what he risked. He no longer associates with individuals who use illegal \ndrugs.  \n \nApplicant did sell the remainder of his hydrocodone prescription, approximately \nten pills, to a fraternity brother for twenty dollars. His action was illegal, but does not \nmake him a drug pusher or supplier. This one-time event occurred five years ago. \nViewed in context, it does not disqualify Applicant from holding a clearance.  \n \nApplicant used marijuana while in college can not be said to be infrequent. \nHowever, his use of hashish, cocaine, LSD, and psychedelic mushrooms is best \n\n \n \n \n7\n                                                          \ndescribed as experimental. He used mushrooms three times and the other drugs once \neach. He inappropriately used alcohol with hydrocodone 15-20 times and with Ritalin 15 \ntimes. The use of these prescription drugs was more than experimental. However, It has \nbeen more than three years since his last of illegal drugs. There are no \u201cbright line\u201d \nrules for determining when conduct is \u201crecent.\u201d The determination must be based \u201con a \ncareful evaluation of the totality of the record within the parameters set by the directive.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). For example, the Appeal Board \ndetermined in ISCR Case No. 98-0608 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 1997), that an applicant's last \nuse of marijuana occurring approximately 17 months before the hearing was not recent. \nIf the evidence shows \u201ca significant period of time has passed without any evidence of \nmisconduct,\u201d then an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time \ndemonstrates \u201cchanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of \nreform or rehabilitation.\u201d2 \n \nBecause of his abstention from drug use for three years, and his recognition of \nthe adverse impact on his life that drug abuse could cause, the incompatibility of illegal \nuse with his goals, and his stated desire never to use again, there is reasonable \ncertitude that he will continue to abstain from drug use. Applicant did not attempt to hide \nhis illegal usage. He disclosed it on his e-QIP, his SF 86, and in interrogatories. His \nillegal drug use ending more than three years ago does not cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Because he will not use illegal drugs in the \nfuture, confidence in his current reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment with \nrespect to drug use is restored. AG \u00b6 26(a) applies. \n \n2 ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). In ISCR Case No. 04-09239 at 5 (App. \nBd. Dec. 20, 2006), the Appeal Board reversed the judge\u2019s decision denying a clearance, focusing on the \nabsence of drug use for five years prior to the hearing. The Appeal Board determined that the judge \nexcessively emphasized the drug use while holding a security clearance, and the 20 plus years of drug \nuse, and gave too little weight to lifestyle changes and therapy. For the recency analysis the Appeal \nBoard stated:  \n \nCompare ISCR Case No. 98-0394 at 4 (App. Bd. June 10, 1999) (although the passage \nof three years since the applicant's last act of misconduct did not, standing alone, compel \nthe administrative judge to apply Criminal Conduct Mitigating Condition 1 as a matter of \nlaw, the Judge erred by failing to give an explanation why the Judge decided not to apply \nthat mitigating condition in light of the particular record evidence in the case) with ISCR \nCase No. 01-02860 at 3 (App. Bd. May 7, 2002) (\u201cThe administrative judge articulated a \nrational basis for why she had doubts about the sufficiency of Applicant's efforts at \nalcohol rehabilitation.\u201d) (citation format corrections added). \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 05-11392 at 1-3 (App. Bd. Dec. 11, 2006) the Appeal Board, considered the recency \nanalysis of an administrative judge stating: \n \nThe administrative judge made sustainable findings as to a lengthy and serious history of \nimproper or illegal drug use by a 57-year-old Applicant who was familiar with the security \nclearance process.  That history included illegal marijuana use two to three times a year \nfrom 1974 to 2002 [drug use ended four years before hearing].  It also included the illegal \npurchase of marijuana and the use of marijuana while holding a security clearance. \n \n\n \n \n \n8\nAG \u00b6 26(b) applies because he has stated he will not use illegal drugs in the \nfuture. He has demonstrated his intent not to abuse drugs in the future by the three \nyears since his last use and by signing a statement of intent with automatic revocation \nof his clearance for any violation.  \n \nAG \u00b6 26(c) has limited applicability. He had a prescription for hydrocodone and \nmisused the remaining prescription. He had no prescription for Ritalin. The abuse of \nthese two prescription drugs ended in 2003 and is no longer a problem. AG \u00b6 26(d) \ndoes not applies because he has not completed a drug treatment program. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant, while in college, \nexperimented with LSD and psychedelic mushrooms. Following college, he tried \nhashish once and cocaine once. His use of marijuana was more extensive as was his \nmisuse of Ritalin and hydrocodone. It appears the majority of his illegal drug use \noccurred while he was in college.  \n \nHe is now out of college, does not routinely see his fraternity brothers, is hard \nworking, diligent, and responsible. His friends and co-workers praise his character and \ndedication. He is living within his means and is current on his debts. He has more than \n$50,000 in savings and more than $20,000 in retirement plans. His decisions reflect his \nmaturity and life goals.  \n \n\n \n \n \n9\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his drug involvement.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H, \nDrug Involvement:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.h: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n \n",

After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 33-year-old information technology support technician.3 He has never been married and has no children. He attended college from June 2000 to May 2002. It is not clear from the record whether he received his Associate\u2019s degree. He also completed several information technology certifications to stay current in his field.

He continuously held that interim access to classified information to the day of his hearing. He has been working for his current employer, a defense contractor, since 2005. Applicant\u2019s security clearance concerns arose primarily out of his long time and extensive illegal use of marijuana. He started using alcohol and marijuana at age 14 (Tr. 32).

Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn April 11, 2006, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP).1 On July 31, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, pursuant to \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised.2 The SOR alleges security \n \n1  GE 1. He also submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on January 24, 2005 (GE 2).  \n \n2  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nNovember 10, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                            \nconcerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement) and Guideline J (Criminal Conduct). \nThe SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative \nfinding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nor continue a security clearance for him, and recommended referral to an administrative \njudge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or \nrevoked. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 19, 2008, and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on September 3, 2008. \nThe Notice of Hearing was issued on September 17, 2008, convening a hearing on \nOctober 14, 2008. The hearing was convened as scheduled. The Government \npresented nine exhibits, marked GE 1-9. GEs 1-5 were admitted without objection. \nApplicant objected to GEs 6-9 on the basis that the documents were too old and not \nrelevant. I found the documents relevant and material to Applicant\u2019s security clearance \nadjudication and admitted them over Applicant\u2019s objection (Tr. 26-30). Applicant testified \non his own behalf, and presented no documents. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on \nOctober 22, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations. His admissions are incorporated \nherein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of \nrecord, I make the following additional findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 33-year-old information technology support technician.3 He has \nnever been married and has no children. He attended college from June 2000 to May \n2002. It is not clear from the record whether he received his Associate\u2019s degree. He \nalso completed several information technology certifications to stay current in his field.  \n \nAfter college, in 2002, Applicant was hired by a defense contractor and received \ninterim access to classified information at the secret level (Tr. 6). He continuously held \nthat interim access to classified information to the day of his hearing. He has been \nworking for his current employer, a defense contractor, since 2005. \n \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance concerns arose primarily out of his long time and \nextensive illegal use of marijuana. He started using alcohol and marijuana at age 14 (Tr. \n32). From age 16 to 19, he used marijuana daily (Tr. 51). In July 1993, he was arrested \nand charged with misdemeanor Theft. The charge was placed on a Stet docket. In \nNovember 1994, at age 19, he attempted to enlist in the U.S. Army; however, he failed \n \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006.  \n \n3  GE 1 is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless stated otherwise. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \na urinalysis test and was rejected (Tr. 80). Thereafter, he continued to abuse marijuana \ndaily until 1997 (Tr. 56). \n \nIn October 1995, Applicant was arrested and charged with Possession with Intent \nto Distribute Marijuana. The charge was placed on a Stet docket. In May 1996, he was \narrested and charged with Possession with Intent to Distribute Marijuana and \nPossession of Controlled Dangerous Substance, both felonies. He was convicted of the \nlater offense and sentenced to pay a $1,450 fine ($1,000 suspended), and one-year \nsupervised probation. The terms of the probation were later modified to 90 days \nunsupervised probation to allow Applicant to enlist in the U.S. Navy (Tr. 81). \n \nHe enlisted in the U.S. Navy in April 1997. He testified \u201c[I] kind of stopped, sort \nof\u201d using marijuana while in the Navy (Tr. 51, 54). In 1998, he tested positive twice for \nuse of marijuana (Tr. 59). While in the Navy, he used marijuana approximately twice \nevery three months (Tr. 57). He was diagnosed as alcohol dependent and underwent \nsubstance abuse counseling (Tr. 48). In May 1998, he received non-judicial punishment \nunder Article 15, UCMJ, and was later administratively discharged from the Navy. His \nservice was characterized as \u201cother than honorable.\u201d After his discharge, he again \nstarted to use marijuana frequently (Tr. 58).  \n \nApplicant attended the Jobs Corps and college from 1999 to 2002 (GE 1). While \nin college he used marijuana approximately three times a month (Tr. 61). From 2002 to \n2007, he used marijuana approximately twice a month (Tr. 63-64). Applicant claimed \nthat since 2007, he has used marijuana only three times (Tr. 64). In January 2007, he \nwas arrested while smoking marijuana in the street. He was charged and convicted of \nPossession of marijuana. He was sentenced to 60 days community service, required to \nparticipate in an eight week drug counseling class (Narcotics Anonymous (NA), and \nplaced on one-year probation (Tr. 68-69). He used marijuana again on February 21, \n2007, while participating in a poker game (Tr. 38). The last time he used marijuana was \non July 4, 2008, while celebrating Independence Day with a group of friends in the \nNation\u2019s capital (Tr. 36, 65, 73). \n \nApplicant stated he has never used any other illegal drugs (Tr. 55). He used \nmarijuana because it calmed him down, and helped him to stay focused and to study \n(Tr. 32, 43). He was aware it is illegal to use marijuana, but it was cheaper than buying \nprescription medications. He believes he is not a bad person, and claimed not to sell \ndrugs (Tr. 47). He testified he is not a security risk, and that he would never betray the \nUnited States. He considers himself to be trustworthy and a good, reliable worker. \n \nDuring his hearing, Applicant repeatedly promised to stop using marijuana Tr. 32-\n35, 89). Now that he is aware of the serious security clearance concerns it raises, and \nthe possibility of loosing his job, he promised to never use marijuana again (Tr. 32.) He \nneeds his job and believes using marijuana is not worth loosing his job. Applicant \ntestified that the only way he would use marijuana again is \u201cif they make it legal \u2013 I \nwould just be the happiest person in the world,\u201d or if he moves to Canada (Tr. 67-67). \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d4 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).5 \n \n \n4  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n5  \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n5 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 24 articulates the government\u2019s security concern under this guideline: \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s 19 years of frequent illegal use of marijuana raise security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 25(a): \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d AG \u00b6 25(b): \u201ctesting positive for illegal drug use, \nAG \u00b6 25(c): \u201cillegal drug possession, including . . . purchase, sale, or distribution,\u201d AG \u00b6 \n25(d): \u201cdiagnosis . . . of drug dependence,\u201d and AG \u00b6 25(g): \u201cany illegal drug use after \nbeing granted a security clearance.\u201d \n \nI specifically considered all Guideline H mitigating conditions and conclude that \nnone apply. Considering the record evidence as a whole, I find Applicant\u2019s illegal \nmarijuana use to be frequent and recent. Applicant\u2019s promises to stop abusing \nmarijuana in the future are not persuasive in light of his 19-year record of frequent \nmarijuana abuse. Moreover, he continued his illegal use of marijuana even after facing \nmarijuana related criminal charges four times. Applicant failed to establish that his \nquestionable behavior is not likely to recur. AG \u00b6 26(a) and AG \u00b6 26(b) do not apply. He \npresented some evidence of drug abuse counseling or attendance in a rehabilitation \nprogram; however, he continued to abuse marijuana after such counseling. AG \u00b6 26(d) \ndoes not apply. \n \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole, I conclude Applicant=s behavior \nshows questionable judgment and leaves doubt about Applicant\u2019s ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                           \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nUnder Guideline J, the security concern is that criminal activity \u201ccreates doubt \nabout a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into \nquestion a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d AG \n\u00b6 30.  \n \n \nApplicant was charged with misdemeanor Theft in 1993. He was charged with \ndrug related offenses, including two felony charges, in 1995, 1996, 1998, 2007 and \n2008.6 Moreover, since he was 14 years old, he has been repeatedly and intentionally \nviolating the law with his frequent illegal use of marijuana. Applicant\u2019s overall behavior \nraises security concerns under Criminal Conduct disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 31(a) \u201ca \nsingle serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d and AG \u00b6 31(c) \u201callegation or \nadmission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, \nformally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32 lists four conditions that could mitigate the criminal conduct security \nconcerns raised under AG \u00b6 31. After considering all the mitigating conditions, I find that \nnone apply. Applicant\u2019s illegal use of marijuana extends from around 1989 to July 4, \n2008, thus, his illegal behavior is recent. He presented no credible evidence of \nsuccessful rehabilitation. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n6  Applicant disclosed the 2007-2008 marijuana offenses at his hearing. They were not alleged in the SOR \nand cannot be used as grounds to deny Applicant under Guideline J. However, I am required to consider \nApplicant\u2019s overall questionable behavior when evaluating the seriousness of the conduct alleged in the \nSOR to determine factors such as the extent to which his behavior is recent, the likelihood of recurrence, \nand his rehabilitation. ISCR Case No. 04-09959 at 3 (App. Bd. May 19, 2006). \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nApplicant\u2019s educational achievements and record of employment for a \ngovernment contractor weighs in his favor. He promised to abstain from any illegal drug \nuse and to make changes in his lifestyle. These factors show some responsibility, \nrehabilitation, and mitigation. Other factors tend to mitigate concerns such as his \ncounseling, expressed remorse, and job performance. \n \n \nThe evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct is overwhelming. Several \nfactors weigh against mitigation including the nature and seriousness of the offenses, \nand his age and education. He has a significant history of frequent and recent illegal \ndrug abuse. Applicant was well aware of the illegality of using marijuana and the \nadverse legal consequences for his actions. Notwithstanding his brushes with the law, \nhe continued his illegal drug abuse at least until July 4, 2008. I note that since 2002, he \nhad interim access to classified information at the secret level. Applicant\u2019s overall \nbehavior casts serious doubts about his judgment, reliability, and willingness to comply \nwith laws, rules and regulations.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to drug involvement and criminal conduct.    \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:    \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.e  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJuan J. Rivera \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Goldstein, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nSeptember 23, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on March 5, 2008.  On May 21, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guideline G for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 3, 2008.  He answered the\nSOR in writing on June 10, 2008, and requested a hearing before an Administrative\nJudge.  The matter was assigned to this Administrative Judge on July 9, 2008.  A notice\nof hearing was issued on July 14, 2008, and the matter was scheduled for hearing on\nAugust 7, 2008.  The Government presented four Exhibits, referred to as Government\nExhibits 1 through 4, which were received without objection. The Applicant presented\nfive Exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A and E, which were received without\nobjection.  He also testified on his own behalf.  DOHA received the transcript of the\nhearing (Tr.) on August 14, 2008.   I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record\nopen until close of business on August 20, 2008, to submit additional documentation.\n\n2\nThe Applicant submitted one Post-Hearing Exhibit, consisting of two pages, that was\nreceived without objection. The record closed on August 20, 2008.  Based upon a\nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 24 years old and has a Bachelors of Science in Information\nSystems Technology.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a Junior Systems\nEngineer, and is applying for a security clearance in connection with his employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline G - Alcohol Consumption).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he abuses intoxicants.\nThe Applicant admitted the allegation set forth in the SOR under this guideline.\n(See Applicant\u2019s response to SOR).  He began consuming alcohol during his\nsophomore year of college in 2004.  He drank beer on Friday and Saturday nights at\nsocial gatherings.  He normally had about three or four beers during these events.  His\ndrinking continued throughout his junior year and on average he drank to the point of\nintoxication about once a month.  During his senior year, his drinking decreased to the\npoint where he was only drinking two to three beers on the weekends.  Besides the\narrest described below, there were two or three other occasions where he drank alcohol\nto the point of intoxication and drove a vehicle but was not arrested. \n  \nOn March 28, 2007, Applicant was arrested for Driving Under the Influence of\nalcohol.  (See Government Exhibit 4).  He testified that he was consuming alcohol at a\nbar with a friend while watching a band.  He and his friend split two to three pitchers of\n\u201cwoodchuck\u201d which is a concoction of apple cider and beer.  After drinking, the Applicant\nwaited about an hour before he left the bar to drive home.  He accelerated his engine\ntoo loud and a police officer pulled him over.  The officer smelled alcohol on his breath\nand took the Applicant to the hospital for a blood test.  The Applicant\u2019s blood alcohol\nlevel was .12 percent and he was arrested and charged accordingly.  He completed a\npretrial diversion program and was eligible to petition the court to have his charge\ndismissed on June 26, 2008.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit 3).  A motion to expunge the\nmatter was filed by the Applicant\u2019s attorney.  They are awaiting the order from the court.\n(See Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).  \nSince the incident, the Applicant\u2019s lifestyle has drastically changed.  He is no\nlonger a college student.  He now has a full time job and is committed to his career.  He\nindicates that although he still consumes alcohol at a decreased level, he no longer\ndrinks and drives.  He has seen the horrors of drinking and driving and what it can do.\nHe has learned from his past experience and that it was a one time mistake and not a\nrefection of his everyday behavior.  In the future, if he is consuming alcohol, he will\nmake sure that he has a designated driver.  \n\n3\nPerformance reviews of the Applicant, albeit self-input reviews, over from the\nperiod January 1, 2007 through December 31, 2007, indicate that he is meeting all of\nhis employment objectives.  (See Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit).  \nLetters of recommendations from the Applicant\u2019s roommate, professional\nassociates and friends indicate that the Applicant is a responsible, hardworking and\ntrustworthy person.  (See Applicant\u2019s Exhibits C, D, and E).  \nPolicies\nEnclosure 2 and Section E.2.2. of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies\ndivided into \"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying\nFactors and Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption)\n21.  The Concern.  Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n22. (a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the\ninfluence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent;\n22. (c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired\njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n23.  (b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has\nestablished a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent or responsible use (if an\nalcohol abuser).\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na. The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb. The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc. The frequency and recency of the conduct\n\n4\nd. The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne. The voluntariness of participation\nf. The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng. The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\ni. The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nConclusion\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in alcohol abuse that demonstrates poor judgment or\nunreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\ncontinued holding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the\nburden then shifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation\n\n5\nor mitigation, which is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The\nApplicant bears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has engaged in alcohol abuse (Guideline G).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has not introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case under Guideline G of the SOR.\nUnder Alcohol Abuse, Guideline G, Disqualifying Conditions 22(a), \u201calcohol-\nrelated incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence, fighting,\nchild or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of\nwhether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent\u201d and,\n22(c), \u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment,\nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent\u201d apply.  However, given the isolated nature of the Applicant\u2019s alcohol abuse,\nMitigating Condition 23(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of\nalcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has\nestablished a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an\nalcohol abuser) also applies. \nThe Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol abuse is fairly recent as he started drinking\nduring college in 2004.  He drank to the point of intoxication on a monthly basis, until at\nleast 2006, and then continued to drink excessively on an intermittent basis.  However,\nsince his arrest in March 2007, for Driving Under the Influence, he has significantly\nreduced his drinking.  He no longer drinks irresponsibly and states that he will never\ndrink and drive again.  His reckless college life is over and he is now a career minded\nindividual.  He has matured and understands the important responsibilities associated\nwith holding a security clearance.  It appears that this aberration or defect in judgment\nwas an isolated one.  Based upon his relatively short history of alcohol abuse, his one\nalcohol related incident that is being expunged, along with the evidence in mitigation, as\nreflected by the favorable statements from his professional colleagues and friends,\nthere is sufficient evidence in the record to show that he is sufficiently trustworthy at this\ntime.  The likelihood of his misconduct in the past being repeated is nil.  Accordingly\nGuideline G is found for the Applicant.  In the event that the Applicant continues to\nabuse alcohol, his security clearance will be in serious jeopardy.\n      \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has come overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the SOR.\n\n6\n     \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: \nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n   \nConclusion\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey-Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn November 9, 2007, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP).1 On February 25, 2008, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR),2 \nalleging security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The SOR \n \n1  Item 4. There is no allegation of falsification of her SF 86.   \n \n2  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nJuly 10, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \ndetailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under \nthe Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for her, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn February 25, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations, and elected \nto have her case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing (Item 2). A complete \ncopy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated April 2, 2008, was provided to her, \nand she was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation.3 Applicant responded to the FORM on June 9, 2008. The \ncase was assigned to me on June 16, 2008. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.f and 1.h. She denied or disputed \nthe remaining SOR allegations. Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of \nfact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is a 52-year-old process analyst. She has worked for a government \ncontractor since February 2007.4 She married in 1978, and her spouse is deceased. \nHer children were born in 1977, 1982 and 1983. One of her sons is handicapped and \nlives with her. She served in the Army reserves from 1989 to the present, and is \ncurrently a staff sergeant (E-6).5 She did not list her education level on her SF 86. She \nhas no police record. She has not used illegal drugs in the last seven years, and has \nnever used illegal drugs while in a sensitive position.  \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nThe SOR lists eight debts totaling approximately $8,000. The following table \nshows the status of the delinquent debts listed in the SOR: \n \nSOR \u00b6 and Type Debt   \nAmount \nStatus \n\u00b6 1.a Credit Card Account  \n$2,099 \nJudgment filed on May 22, 2006 \n(Items 5, 7) \n\u00b6 1.b Medical Account \n$3,629 \nJudgment filed on June 22, 2000 \n(Items 5, 8) \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d and 1.e  \nTelephone or  \n$1,126, $739 \nand $218 \nCollection Account was Paid in \nApril \n2008 \n(Item \n5; \nFORM \n                                                          \n3  Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter, is dated Apr. 10, 2008; and \nApplicant\u2019s receipt is signed and dated Apr. 15, 2008.  \n \n4  Item 4 (2007 security clearance application) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless \nstated otherwise. \n \n5  The file does not contain her military or enlistment records.  \n\n \n3 \n \n \nCable Services  \nresponse at 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6) \n\u00b6 1.f Medical Account \n$100 \nCollection account reported in \nDecember 2006 was Paid (Item 3 \nat 2, 3 and Item 5)  \n\u00b6 1.g Insurance Account \n$389 \nDisputed debt \n\u00b6 1.h Medical Account \n$400 \nCollection account reported in \nDecember 2006 (Item 3 at 2 and \nItem 5) \n \nConcerning SOR \u00b6 1.a ($2,099 judgment filed in May 2006), after receipt of the \nSOR, Applicant contacted the creditor attempting to settle the debt without success. \nShe was going to include the debt in a debt consolidation program (answer to SOR at 8-\n12), and then changed her mind and decided to file for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy protection \nto resolve her delinquent debts (Response to the Form at 14).  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b \u2013 Applicant disputed the amount of the debt, but admitted having \nseveral delinquent medical bills. She had included some of her debts in the \nunsuccessful debt consolidation program (answer to the SOR). \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d and 1.e ($1,126, $739, and $218) were reported delinquent in \nAugust 2005, December 2001, and November 2002. The account numbers for the \n$1,126 and $739 debts correspond. The evidence suggests the two accounts are a \nduplication of each other. On March 24, 2008, Applicant provided a statement from the \ncreditor in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c \u2013 1.e, dated March 1, 2008, indicating she owed $836 (Item 3 at \n5).6 Her evidence established that these accounts were transferred from collector A to \ncollector B for collection (FORM response at 8). She included a letter from collector B, \ndated February 20, 2008, showing a settlement amount of $440 on a $734 medical debt \n(FORM response at 7). Her FORM response indicated collector B agreed to a \nsettlement amount of $1,590 for other debts to be paid in three equal payments (FORM \nresponse at 1). She made the three payments on March 17, 31, and on April 14, 2008 \n(FORM response at 1, 3 - 6).   \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.h ($100 and $400) are medical debts placed for collection, and \nreported to a credit reporting agency in December 2006 (Item 5). She paid SOR \u00b6 1.f; \nand SOR \u00b6 1.h is still outstanding. She disputed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g ($389). This debt \nwas placed for collect on an insurance account. She said that when she ended her \npolicy she received a refund check, and did not believe she owed any money. However, \nshe did not provide any correspondence with the creditor showing she disputed the \ndebt.  \n \nWhen she completed her e-QIP, she denied she had any: (1) unpaid judgments \nin the last seven years; (2) any debts delinquent over 180 days in the last seven years; \n                                                          \n6  She provided one page from a three-page statement from the creditor showing she paid $73.85 \non December 3, 2007, and at that time owed $361 (Item 3 at 6). On March 1, 2008, she owed the same \ncreditor $836 (Item 3 at 5). \n\n \n4 \n \n \nand (3) any debts currently delinquent over 90 days. (See Item 4, Sections 27d, 28a \nand 28b.) Applicant did not receive notice in the SOR that a failure to disclose her \nfinancial problems raised a security concern. As such, these omissions cannot be used \nto deny her clearance. However, I may consider these omissions as part of the totality \nof the circumstances in Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nOn February 7, 2008, Applicant responded to interrogatories and promised to \nuse a debt consolidation company to pay the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \u2013 1.e and 1.h (Item 9 \nat 2). She provided a budget indicating a $140 monthly payment to the debt \nconsolidation company, and $99 monthly to the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a (Item 9 at 3). \nApplicant provided pages 1, 4, 5, 9 and 10 of her debt consolidation agreement (Item 3 \nat 7-12). The service fee was $904, with an initial payment of $276 (Item 3 at 12). A \nletter from the debt consolidation company, dated May 28, 2008, indicated Applicant \nhad enrolled in their 36-month program. The program\u2019s goal was to resolve three debts, \nand she paid $92.05 on March 22, 2008, and April 22, 2008 (FORM response at 12, \n13).  \n \nOn May 12, 2008, she retained a law firm to file to discharge her debts under \nChapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code (FORM response at 14). There is no explanation as \nto why she terminated her debt consolidation program. Applicant also failed to present \ninformation regarding when she acquired the debts, why they became delinquent, what \nefforts she took to pay, settle, or otherwise resolve her delinquent debts, and how she \nplans to avoid future financial problems. \n \nApplicant\u2019s budget showed a gross monthly salary of $5,004, deductions of \n$1,133, expenses of $1,222 and a net remainder of $1,801 (Item 9 at 3). She listed \nmonthly payments of $471 for a vehicle loan, $138 for a financial company, $140 for the \ndebt consolidation company, and $99 for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b (Item 9 at 3).    \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d7 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).8 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \n \n7  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n8  \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n6 \n \n \nabove, I conclude the relevant security concern is under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is documented in her credit reports, her SOR \nresponse, and her FORM response. She admitted responsibility for all the alleged \ndelinquent debts, except SOR \u00b6 1.g. She hired an attorney to file for Chapter 7 \nBankruptcy protection to resolve her delinquent debts; however, as of the day she \nresponded to the FORM her debts were still outstanding. The government established \nthe disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) \nbecause available information fails to establish she acted diligently and responsibly to \nresolve her delinquent debts.9 She did not disclose how she acquired the debts; why \nthey became delinquent; what efforts she took prior to receipt of the SOR to resolve her \ndebts; or, any conditions beyond her control that resulted in her financial problems \n(such as loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or \na death, divorce or separation). She is responsible for three delinquent debts totaling \nabout $6,000. It appears she began her attempts to resolve her delinquent debts only \nafter receipt of the SOR. It is unclear when her last payments were made on any of \nthese three delinquent debts.  \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) do not fully apply. Applicant probably received some \nfinancial counseling in connection with creation of her budget, working with the debt \nconsolidation company, and meeting with her bankruptcy attorney. However, there are \nnot \u201cclear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d There is \ninsufficient information to establish that Applicant applied the knowledge obtained from \nfinancial counseling or that she showed good faith10 in the resolution of her debts. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is applicable to the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g because Applicant disputed the \n$389 debt. She denied responsibility for this debt from the outset, and the only basis for \nthe debt was a credit report. She did not provide \u201cdocumented proof to substantiate the \nbasis of the dispute or [provide] evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d \nNotwithstanding, it is a relatively small debt and, under the circumstance of her case, I \ndo not consider the dispute documentation necessary.  \n \nApplicant did not provide proof of her most recent correspondence with the \ncreditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.h, nor did she present evidence of her current \n \n9  \u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). \n \n10  The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nfinancial situation. Considering the record as a whole, I conclude these three debts, \ntotaling about $6,000 are still valid, delinquent debts, and that Applicant is responsible \nfor them. Applicant failed to explain why she did not established payment plans for her \ndebts even though according to her budget she has available income (about $1,800 \nmonthly) to take this reasonable and prudent action.  \n \nApplicant has the legal right to file for bankruptcy protection to resolve her \ndelinquent debts. However, considering her available income, her unexplained filing for \nbankruptcy protection raises questions about her current and future financial situation. \nHer overall conduct with her creditors casts doubt on her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. She should have been more diligent and made \ngreater efforts to resolve her delinquent debts, especially after receipt of the SOR on \nMarch 24, 2008. She has not carried her burden of proving her financial responsibility. \nBased on my evaluation of the record evidence as a whole, I conclude no mitigating \nconditions fully apply.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole person concept. AG  \u00b6 2(c).   \nApplicant\u2019s record of good employment weighs in her favor. There is no evidence \nof any security violation. Aside from her delinquent debts (which is a civil, non-criminal \nissue), she is a law-abiding citizen. She served in the Army reserves for almost 20 \nyears. These factors show some responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. The overall \namount of her delinquent debt at about $6,000 is relatively low.  \n \nThe evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct is more substantial. \nApplicant has been carrying delinquent debts since around 2001. She was well aware of \nher financial responsibilities, and apparently had sufficient resources to establish \npayment plans with her creditors. Because of her age and position in the Army reserve, \n\n \n9 \n \n \n                                                          \nshe knew or should have known of the security significance of these delinquent debts. \nIn March 2008, she received the SOR and was placed on further notice of the \nGovernment\u2019s security concerns. Her efforts to resolve her delinquent debts were \ninsufficient when compared to available income that she could have used to address \nher delinquent debts. Her actions were not adequate to fully resolve security concerns. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude the sparse favorable \ninformation available in the record is not sufficient to mitigate the security concerns \npertaining to financial considerations.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d11 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude she is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n Against Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c to 1.g: \n For Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJuan J. Rivera \nAdministrative Judge \n \n11  See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

Applicant was born in the U.S. to a Danish mother in 1979 and thereby acquired Danish citizenship. In 1992, he and his mother moved to Denmark to care for his grandfather who died the next year. They stayed until 1999 to help care for his grandmother during which time he attended an international high school and one year at a university (Tr. 24) (SOR \u00b6 1.b.). He wanted to continue his education in the U.S. so he and his mother returned to the U.S. He enrolled in a U.S. university which he attended between 2000 and 2005. In 2004, he was granted a degree in computer sciences, and a second degree in psychology in 2005.

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nStatement of the Case\n \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (e-QIP), on January 5,\n2007. On February 27, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns for Applicant\nunder Guideline C. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.\nSeptember 22, 2008\n\n2\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 24, 2008 and requested a\ndecision without a hearing. DOHA converted the matter to a hearing before an\nadministrative judge. In his answer he admitted two allegations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a.,and b.)\nand denied the other two (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c.,and d.) . Department Counsel was prepared to\nproceed on April 15, 2008. I received the case assignment on June 10, 2008. DOHA\nissued a notice of hearing on June 13, 2008, for a hearing on July 24, 2008. I convened\nthe hearing as scheduled. \nAt the hearing, the government offered two exhibits (Exhs 1 and 2) that were\nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant submitted seven exhibits (Exhs. A-G)\nwhich were admitted without objection. He testified on his own behalf. DOHA received\nthe transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on August 1, 2008.\nProcedural Rulings\nSOR Amendment\n         The government moved to amend SOR \u00b6 l.c. to conform to the evidence and show\nthat a loan was not from a Danish company but from the Government of Denmark. No\nobjection was made to the amendment, and the motion was granted. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 28-year-old who has worked as an engineer for two defense\ncontractors since February 2004 He has held an interim security clearance since his\nwork for the first company and he is now applying for a higher level of clearance. \nApplicant was born in the U.S. to a Danish mother in 1979 and thereby acquired\nDanish citizenship. In 1992, he and his mother moved to Denmark to care for his\ngrandfather who died the next year. They stayed until 1999 to help care for his\ngrandmother during which time he attended an international high school and one  year\nat a university (Tr. 24) (SOR \u00b6 1.b.). He wanted to continue his education in the U.S. so\nhe and his mother returned to the U.S. He enrolled in a U.S. university which he\nattended between 2000 and 2005. In 2004, he was granted a degree in computer\nsciences, and a second degree in psychology in 2005.\nDuring the period Applicant lived in Denmark, he applied for and received a\nDanish passport in 1998 when he became 18-years-old because he could no longer\ntravel on his mother\u2019s passport (SOR \u00b6 1.a.). The passport expired in 2002, and it was\nnever used (Tr. 22-24). He lost it in a recent move. He will surrender it if it is found.\nWhen Applicant was attending university in Denmark he obtained a student loan\nfor $50,000 (Tr. 25) (SOR \u00b6 1.c.) from the Danish government that was available to any\nDanish citizen studying there. He is still regarded as a citizen of Denmark but would\nrevoke his citizenship but for the fact that, if he did so, he would be required to pay the\nloan in full within eight days. He is not able financially to do so. He would borrow funds\n\n3\nto do so on his home to do so but does not yet have enough equity in it to be able to do\nso. He also has a U.S. student loan for approximately $17,000. Both student loans are\nin deferment (Tr. 37).\nApplicant also has a Master Card credit card from a Danish bank on which he\nowes $5,000. This card is no different from those issued from U.S. banks. He is paying\non the card, and it is in good standing . He recently bought his own home in the U.S. for\n$265,000 on which he has a significant mortgage. \nIn his security interview in March 13, 2007, Applicant stated that, because of his\nfriends and family in Denmark, he would be reluctant to take up arms against Denmark\nshould that ever be required. He stated at the hearing that he is willing to bear arms for\nthe United States. \nThe government did not offer any documents for administrative notice in\nApplicant\u2019s hearing, relating to Denmark, the country at issue, as is often done in cases\ninvolving either of the foreign guidelines (B and C). However, a recent Department of\nDefense web page notes that Denmark recently joined the Joint Strike Fighter program\nto which they will make a significant financial contribution, that President Bush\nexpressed thanks to Denmark for its increased troop contributions in Iraq, and praised\nDenmark for its cooperation in the War on Terrorism. \nApplicant is highly regarded for his skills, work ethic and loyalty to the U.S. by the\nsenior corporate officers of his current employer (Exhs. A and B), a family friend who\nhas known him since birth (Exh. D), his university professor with whom he has a close\nprofessional and personal relationship (Exh. E), and two colleagues from his present\nand former employment (Exhs. F and G).\nApplicant also submitted a letter from his mother (Exh. C) which details some of\nthe facts concerning the Danish passport, the student loan, and her likely inheritance\nfrom her 92-year-old mother in Denmark which will be used to pay the student loan\nshould it not be settled before her death. Applicant has some responsibility for his\nmother who lives with him and works as a legal secretary. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n\n4\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\n\u201cthe whole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) listing multiple prerequisites for\naccess to classified or sensitive information. \nAnalysis\nGuideline C, Foreign Preference\nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all appropriate\nlegal precepts, factors and conditions above, I conclude the following with respect to all\nallegations set forth in the SOR: \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Preference is set out in\nAG \u00b6 9: \n\n5\n\u201c[W]hen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign\ncountry over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or\nmake decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\nAG \u00b6 10 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after\nbecoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member.\nThis includes but is not limited to:\n(1) possession of a current foreign passport;\n(2) military service or a willingness to bear arms for a foreign country;\n(3) accepting educational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or other such\nbenefits from a foreign country;\n(4) residence in a foreign country to meet citizenship requirements;\n(5) using foreign citizenship to protect financial. or business interests in\nanother country;\n(6) seeking or holding political office in a foreign country; and,\n(7) voting in a foreign election;\n(b) action to acquire or obtain recognition of a foreign citizenship by an American\ncitizen;\n(c) performing or attempting to perform duties, or otherwise acting, so as to serve\nthe interests of a foreign person, group, organization, or government in conflict\nwith the national security interest; and,\n(d) any statement or action that shows allegiance to a country other than the\nUnited States: for example, declaration of intent to renounce United States\ncitizenship; renunciation of United States citizenship.\nThe debt owed to the Government of Denmark for a student loan to study in the\nU.S. has raised security concerns under Sec. (a) (3). of the guideline. The other actions\nalleged in the SOR do not raise such concerns since he no longer has a passport and\nhas not indicated any desire to bear arms for a foreign country. I do not interpret his\nstatement about family and friends in Denmark as sufficient to raise serious security\nconcerns. \n\n6\nAG \u00b6 11 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a\nforeign country;\n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual\ncitizenship;\n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship\noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the individual was a\nminor;\n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security\nauthority.\n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant\nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated; and,\n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United States\nGovernment.\nI conclude that security concerns have been mitigated by Sections, a., b., and e\nsince his dual citizenship is based solely on his mother\u2019s citizenship, he has expressed\na willingness to renounce dual citizenship but cannot at the present time because of the\nfinancial situation, and the passport is expired and lost.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2)\nthe circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency\nof the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the\ntime of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is\nvoluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for\nthe conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion,\nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation\nor recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\n\n7\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I considered the\npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding this case. The security concerns do not arise because of\nany misconduct by Applicant but solely because of his having been born to a Danish\nmother and obtained a loan to start his higher education in Denmark while living abroad\nwith his family. Denmark is a staunch ally of the U.S. and presents no security issues\nthat give me concern. Applicant is a well-educated citizen of the U.S. who is making a\nsignificant contribution to the national defense and U.S. interests. \nI conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from the\nissues of foreign preference.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline C: FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.: For Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d.: For Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Access to classified information is granted. \nCHARLES D. ABLARD \nAdministrative Judge\n",

The case was assigned to me on May 13, 2009. DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing on June 9, 2009, scheduling the hearing for July 7, 2009. The hearing \nwas convened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 9, which \nwere received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted \nExhibits (AE) A through G, which were received without objection. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 15, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 55-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for \nhis current employer since September 2006. He is a graduate of a technical school and \nalso has an associate\u2019s degree. He has been married and divorced twice. He and his \nsecond wife have reconciled and are living together but they have not remarried. He has \na 23-year-old child.1 \n \n \nApplicant has a history of alcohol-related arrests, drug use, and criminal activity. \nHe was arrested in August 1999, and charged with driving under the influence (DUI) of \nliquor/drugs, DUI per se, and unlawful narcotics. The police found psilocybin \nmushrooms, a controlled substance, in his car. Applicant attended alcohol treatment \nbetween October 1999 and January 2000. In about December 1999, he pled guilty to a \nreduced charge of driving while ability impaired (DWAI) and was fined. He received a \ntwo-year deferred sentence on his drug charge. Between February 2000 and \nSeptember 2000, he participated in 40 hours of court-ordered alcohol education \nclasses.2 \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in March 2001, and charged with DUI, second offense in \nfive years, DUI per se, and negligent child abuse. His 15-year-old child was in the car \nwhen he was arrested. Applicant was found guilty of negligent child abuse and the \nreduced charge of DWAI. Between June 2001 and June 2002, he participated in 68 \nhours of court-ordered alcohol education classes. He violated the terms of his probation \nin July 2001, by drinking alcohol. He was found guilty of contempt of court and \nsentenced to 28 days in jail.3 \n \n \nApplicant worked for the U.S. Postal Service as a letter carrier from 1973 to \n2001. In November 2001, Applicant stole some of the mail he was carrying. He was \narrested by postal inspectors for mail theft, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1709. He pled \nguilty in July 2002. He received three years probation. Applicant left his employment at \nthe Postal Service shortly after his arrest. He testified that he voluntarily resigned \nbecause he was afraid that if he remained in the job and was prosecuted, he might lose \nhis retirement. He told an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \non April 12, 2007, that the postal inspectors brought him to the post office where he was \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 49-50; GE 1. \n \n2 Tr. at 33, 50-51; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-4, 9. \n \n3 Tr. at 34-35, 51-53; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 5, 9. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nquestioned. Applicant had been drinking the day of the incident. His personal items \nwere removed from his locker; he was taken home; and he was told he would be \nremoved from his position. He later told the investigator that he was terminated from his \nposition. A signed statement was not provided but the interview was memorialized in a \nreport of investigation (ROI). DOHA sent Applicant a copy of the ROI in an interrogatory \nand asked him if the ROI accurately reflected the information he provided to the \ninvestigator on the day he was interviewed. He was provided the opportunity to explain \nwhy the ROI was inaccurate and to add additional information regarding the matters \ndiscussed during the interview. He answered that the ROI was accurate with some \nminor modifications unrelated to his employment at the Postal Service.4 \n \n \nApplicant was a sporadic marijuana user during much of his life. He smoked \nmarijuana in about March 2003, while he was on federal probation. He was drug-tested \nby the probation department and tested positive for marijuana. There is no evidence of \nany illegal drug use after March 2003.5 \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in July 2003, for his third DUI. He pled guilty to DWAI and \nwas sentenced to six months in jail. In January 2004, his federal probation was revoked \nand he was sentenced to eight months incarceration. Between September 2004 and \nJanuary 2005, Applicant participated in 24 hours of alcohol education classes, as \ndirected by the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).6 \n \n \nApplicant was arrested for his fourth DUI in November 2006. He pled guilty to \nDWAI and was sentenced to six months in jail. He was also required to perform \ncommunity service.7 \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) on \nFebruary 26, 2007. Question 22 of the SF 86 asked:  \n \n \nHas any of the following happened to you in the last 7 years?  \n \n \n1. Fired from a job.  \n \n2. Quit a job after being told you\u2019d be fired.  \n \n3. Left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of misconduct.  \n4. Left a job by mutual agreement following allegations of unsatisfactory \nperformance.  \n \n5. Left a job for other reasons under unfavorable circumstances. \n \nQuestion 23f of the SF 86 asked, \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been arrested for, \ncharged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not listed in response to a, b, c, d, or e \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 38-43; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 8. \n \n5 Tr. at 36-37, 54; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2. \n \n6 Tr. at 53-54; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 6, 9. \n \n7 Tr. at 27-29, 46-47; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 7, 9. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nabove (Leave out traffic fines of less than $150 unless the violation was alcohol or drug \nrelated.)\u201d Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to both questions. In response to other questions, \nApplicant listed DWAI convictions in 2001 and 2003. He listed a conviction for \n\u201c[p]ossession of mushrooms\u201d in 1999, and he listed marijuana use on two occasions in \nMarch 2003. He did not list the mail fraud conviction, nor did he list his DUI arrest in \nNovember 2006. Applicant admitted that he intentionally did not list the mail theft \nconviction and the loss of his Postal Service job because he did not want his employer \nto know about the incidents.8 \n \n \nApplicant does not own a car. The DMV requires that any car he drives must \nhave a breathalyzer installed, so that he cannot drink and drive. He has not had a valid \ndriver\u2019s license since his 2006 arrest. He was in a car accident in November 2007, while \nhe had a revoked license. He testified that incident was the only time he has driven \nsince the 2006 arrest. Applicant was working overseas for a period. He was arrested for \nthe November 2007 incident when he returned to the United States in April 2008. He \nwas convicted in October 2008, and sentenced to 15 days in jail. He stated that he \ncontinues to drink alcohol, but in moderation. He estimated his drinking at about a six \npack of beer, or less, about once a week.9 \n \n \nApplicant has worked very hard at learning a new trade. He attended school and \ncompleted an apprenticeship in the trade. He is now a journeyman. Two of his \nsupervisors wrote letters on his behalf. He is regarded as a valued employee whose \nattendance and tardiness record is impeccable. He is described as prompt, dependable, \nreliable, hardworking, and trustworthy. He is recommended for a security clearance.10 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common-sense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \n                                                          \n8 Tr. at 37-38, 43-44; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1. \n \n9 Tr. at 23-24; 28-32, 35, 55-56. Driving on a revoked license was not alleged as a basis for the \ndenial of Applicant\u2019s security clearance in the SOR and will not be used for disqualification purposes. It \nwill be considered in assessing Applicant\u2019s credibility; in the application of mitigating conditions; and in \nevaluating the \u201cwhole person.\u201d \n10 Tr. at 47; AE A-G. \n \n\n \n5 \n \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;  \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted; and \n \n(e) violation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a court-mandated \nrehabilitation program. \n \nApplicant was arrested and convicted on numerous occasions. He violated the \nterms of his probation on more than one occasion. All of the above disqualifying \nconditions have been established. There is insufficient evidence to support the facts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f, as distinct from the conduct alleged in other allegations. SOR \u00b6 1.f \nis concluded for Applicant.  \n \nTwo Criminal Conduct mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \nApplicant has a long criminal history. He intentionally provided false information \non his SF 86 in February 26, 2007, which constituted a federal crime. His most recent \nconviction was in October 2008, for a November 2007 incident. His criminal acts cast \ndoubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 32(a) is not \napplicable. His education, job training, and good work record with his current employer \nare positive signs of rehabilitation. However, insufficient time has elapsed since his last \ncriminal offense for a finding that he is successfully rehabilitated. AG \u00b6 32(d) is partially \napplicable.  \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21:   \n     \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following is potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent. \n \nApplicant has multiple alcohol-related arrests and convictions. AG \u00b6 22(a) is \napplicable. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b through 2.e allege that Applicant participated in an alcohol \ntreatment program and alcohol education classes. That is mitigating evidence and does \nnot raise a disqualifying condition. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b through 2.e are concluded for Applicant. \nSOR \u00b6 2.e alleges that Applicant \u201ccontinues to consume alcohol.\u201d Consuming alcohol, \nstanding alone, does not raise a disqualifying condition. SOR \u00b6 2.e is also concluded for \nApplicant. \n \nThree Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 23 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment;  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s last alcohol-related arrest was in November 2006. He has attended \nseveral court-ordered alcohol programs. He continues to drink alcohol, but indicated \nthat he no longer drinks and drives and he only drinks in moderation. There is no \nfavorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a licensed clinical social \nworker. Based upon Applicant\u2019s extensive history of substance abuse, there is \ninsufficient time without an alcohol-related incident for a finding that Applicant has his \nalcohol use under control. None of the mitigating conditions are applicable.  \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in \nAG \u00b6 24:   \n \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n \nDrug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a manner that \ndeviates from approved medical direction.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) any drug abuse; and \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s drug possession and use are sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) \nas disqualifying conditions.  \n \nTwo Drug Involvement Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;  \n \n(3) an appropriate period of abstinence;  \n \n(4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation.  \n \n \nThere is no evidence that Applicant has used illegal drugs in more than six years. \nApplicant has established an appropriate period of abstinence. AG \u00b6 26(b) is applicable.  \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n \nApplicant intentionally falsified his SF 86 in February 2007. AG \u00b6 16(a) is \napplicable as a disqualifying condition.  \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n\n \n10 \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \nApplicant discussed his federal arrest for mail theft and the loss of his job at the \nPostal Service when he was interviewed by an OPM investigator in April 2007. That \ndoes not constitute a prompt, good-faith effort to correct the falsification before being \nconfronted with the facts. While he receives credit for being honest with the investigator, \nit is insufficient to establish a mitigating condition. I find that no mitigating conditions are \napplicable.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s hard work \nat becoming certified as a journeyman in his trade. I also considered the very favorable \ncomments about his job performance and character from his supervisors. However, \nApplicant has a long history of substance abuse and criminal offenses. He has at least \nfour alcohol-related driving convictions. He lost his longtime job with the Postal Service \nbecause he stole mail. He lied on his SF 86. I continue to have serious doubts about his \njudgment, honesty, and trustworthiness.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated Drug Involvement concerns; but he has not mitigated \nCriminal Conduct, Alcohol Consumption, and Personal Conduct security concerns. \n \n\n \n11 \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.h: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.b-2.f: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline H:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 4, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 4.a-4.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nEdward W.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nHany A. Zohdy, Esq.\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) declined to grant Applicant a security\nclearance.  On August 20, 2010, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of\nthe basis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On February 28, 2011, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Mark Harvey denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge considered all of the\n\n1\u201c[W]hen I went to [two Southwest Asia countries], I specifically went there to meet with and sleep with\nprostitutes.  This is the main reason why I used to go.  But after I met my wife, I continued to go to [two Southwest Asia\ncountries] with other friends but never slept with prostitutes.  I just met with them because they are almost impossible\nto avoid.  They are everywhere.\u201d  Decision at 11, quoting Tr. at 140-141.  \nrecord evidence; whether the Judge erred in his credibility determination; whether certain of the\nJudge\u2019s findings were supported by substantial record evidence; whether the Judge erred in his\napplication of the pertinent mitigating conditions; whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis was\nerroneous; and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable findings under Guideline B, and his favorable findings under allegations 2(a)\nto 2(d) and 2(f) to 2(i) are not at issue in this appeal.  Consistent with the following, we affirm the\nJudge\u2019s decision.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is a linguist employed\nby Defense contractors.  Born in Egypt, he moved to the U.S. and became a citizen of this country\nin the early 1990s.  Applicant is married and has two children from a previous marriage.   \nFrom 2003 to 2005 Applicant had sexual encounters with prostitutes on approximately 15\noccasions in two foreign countries.  Some of these encounters occurred while Applicant was dating\nhis future wife.  Applicant disclosed to his spouse that he had visited prostitutes before dating her.\nDuring an OPM interview, Applicant stated that his wife is aware of the encounters prior to\ntheir having started dating, but that she \u201chas no knowledge of the instances that took place while we\nwere dating . . . She would be heartbroken.  She would be extremely hurt.  I don\u2019t think she would\nleave me but it would take a lot to mend the hurt.\u201d  Decision at 10, quoting Government Exhibit\n(GE) 4, Affidavit to OPM Center for Federal Investigative Services, dated September 9, 2008.  \n In the Analysis portion of the Decision, the Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s encounters\nwith prostitutes remains a security concern.  He stated that Applicant was deceptive at the hearing1\nand that Applicant was more candid in his answers in the OPM affidavit, quoted above. Although\nthe Judge entered favorable findings on all other SOR allegations, he concluded that Applicant had\nfailed to meet his burden of persuasion as to mitigation regarding his encounters with prostitutes.\nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s finding that he had had sexual encounters with prostitutes\nafter he began dating his wife.  Viewed in light of GE 4 and the record as a whole, the challenged\nfinding is supported by substantial record evidence.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  (Substantial\nevidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a\nconclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record\u201d).  In support of his appeal,\nApplicant submits new evidence not contained in the record, including a chart of his foreign travels\nand a witness statement.  We cannot consider this new evidence.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. (\u201cNo new\nevidence shall be received or considered by the Appeal Board\u201d).  See also ISCR Case No. 09-03616\nat 2 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2011).    \nApplicant contends that the Judge failed to consider all of the record evidence, such as his\nevidence of good character and his accolades from the U.S. military.  He also contends that the\nJudge failed to consider, or that he mis-weighed, his testimony concerning when he stopped\n\nengaging in sexual activity with prostitutes.  However, a Judge is presumed to have considered all\nof the record evidence.    See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 09-07395 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 14, 2010).\nApplicant has failed to rebut this presumption.  Neither has he demonstrated that the Judge weighed\nthe evidence in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Moreover, the Judge\u2019s\ndetermination of the relative credibility of Applicant\u2019s testimony and of his 2008 affidavit\nconstitutes a reasonable interpretation of the record evidence.  Applicant has not provided a reason\nto disturb the Judge\u2019s credibility determination.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 09-00395 at 3 (App. Bd.\nJun. 8, 2010).  \nThe record supports a conclusion that the Judge examined the relevant data and articulated\na satisfactory explanation for the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found\nand the choice made,\u2019\u201d both as to the mitigating conditions and the whole-person factors.

The\nJudge\u2019s adverse decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may\nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d  Department\nof the Navy v.

Laverdiere, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Leslie McAdoo Gordon, Esquire \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \nHARVEY, Mark, Administrative Judge: \n \nSummary of Case \n \nApplicant was born in Egypt in 1960. He immigrated to the United States in 1979 \nand became a U.S. citizen in 1990. His spouse was born in the United States; however, \nshe lived in Syria from the age of 3 to 19. She currently lives in the United States and \nhas a Top Secret Department of Defense (DoD)-issued security clearance. She works \nas a linguist. However, she traveled to Syria in 2007, and she communicates with \nseveral aunts and uncles, who live in Syria. Applicant\u2019s two children are U.S. citizens \nand live in the United States. Applicant is a DoD linguist with an exceptional record of \nservice in Iraq. The allegation that Applicant contacted a terrorist entity in Pakistan is \nnot substantiated. Foreign influence concerns raised by his spouse\u2019s connection to \nSyria are mitigated. \n \nApplicant had a 1989 DUI and was arrested in 2002 for impersonating a police \nofficer. He failed to disclose these two events on his 2004 security clearance application \n(SF-86). In 1992, Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e obtained a restraining order against him, which he \nviolated.

On August 20, 2010, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, \nalleging security concerns under Guidelines B (foreign influence) and E (personal \nconduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AGs) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005. The SOR detailed reasons why \nDOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for \nhim, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n \n\n \n3 \n                                                                                                                                              \n                                           \nOn October 6, 2010, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. On November 1, 2010, Department Counsel was \nprepared to proceed. On November 3, 2010, the case was assigned to me. The hearing \nwas delayed while Applicant unsuccessfully sought documentation concerning his \nalleged contact with a terrorist organization in Pakistan. (Tr. 22-23) On December 13, \n2010, DOHA issued a hearing notice and the hearing was held on January 25, 2011. At \nthe hearing, Department Counsel offered 13 exhibits (GE 1-13) (Transcript (Tr.) 26), \nand Applicant offered 20 exhibits (AE A-T). (Tr. 24-25, 39-40) Applicant objected to my \nconsideration of GE 3, and I overruled that objection. See Procedural Rulings, infra. \nThere were no objections to the other exhibits, and I admitted GE 1-13, and AE A-T. (Tr. \n27, 40) Additionally, I admitted the SOR, response to the SOR and the hearing notice. \n(HE 1-3) On February 2, 2011, I received the hearing transcript. I held the record open \nuntil February 3, 2011. (Tr. 167, 219) After the hearing, Applicant provided 13 exhibits, \nwhich were admitted without objection. (AE U-AH)1 Applicant also provided one \ncorrection to the transcript. (HE 4) \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nOn December 1 and 3, 2010, Applicant requested information from the Federal \nBureau of Investigation (FBI) concerning the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a that Applicant \u201chad \ncontact with an entity in Pakistan which has been linked to a known terrorist \norganization.\u201d (AE Z, AH)  \n \nApplicant objected to my consideration of GE 3, a November 22, 2010, FBI \nmemorandum written to DOHA. GE 3 states, \u201cFBI investigation has determined a \npossible contact between [Applicant] and an entity in Pakistan which has been linked to \na known terrorist organization.\u201d Some of the basis of this statement is classified. (Tr. 32-\n33) Applicant objected to the failure to provide discovery concerning the basis of this \nFBI\u2019s statement. (Tr. 28-34, 37-38, 174-76) Department Counsel described GE 3 as an \nadmissible summary of a police record and cited ISCR Case No. 03-06770 (App. Bd. \nSept. 9, 2004) to support admissibility. (Tr. 35-36) I overruled the objection and \nconcluded the objection went to the weight of the evidence, rather than to its \nadmissibility. (Tr. 37) I also noted the document had minimal probative value as \n\u201cpossible contact\u201d showed a speculative and tenuous association between Applicant \nand a Pakistani-terrorist entity. (Tr. 37) Applicant also objected to the hearing statement \nof an FBI special agent that explained the basis of the FBI\u2019s conclusion that there was a \n\u201cpossible\u201d contact between Applicant and the terrorist entity. (Tr. 177, 179, 189) I \noverruled these objections. (Tr. 177, 179, 189) Department Counsel had previously \nreceived a classified FBI report; however, the FBI refused to grant permission to release \nthat report to Applicant, and the classified FBI report was not provided to me. (Tr. 38-39) \nAdditional information concerning GE 3 is in the section \u201cLink to a known terrorist \norganization in Pakistan,\u201d infra at page 5.  \n \nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice of facts concerning Syria \nand Pakistan (Tr. 11). Department Counsel provided supporting documents to show \ndetail and context for the facts in the request. Applicant did not object to me taking \n \n1I marked each document as a separate exhibit. (AE U to AH)  \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                              \n                                           \nadministrative notice of the facts concerning Syria. (Tr. 11, 17) The Syria section of the \nFindings of Fact of this decision, infra, contains the material facts from Department \nCounsel\u2019s submissions on Syria.   \n \nApplicant objected to Department Counsel\u2019s administrative notice request \nconcerning Pakistan, arguing it was not relevant because of the lack of evidence of a \nconnection between Applicant and Pakistan. (Tr. 11-16) Department Counsel explained \nthat Applicant\u2019s connection to Pakistan was a telephone call from Applicant\u2019s telephone \nto a terrorist organization in Pakistan several years ago. Department Counsel agreed to \nnarrow his request for administrative notice to a statement that the Pakistan \nGovernment has a serious problem with terrorism, and there are allegations of linkage \nbetween the Pakistani intelligence service and the Taliban and some terrorist \norganizations. (Tr. 14) I overruled Applicant\u2019s relevancy objection. (Tr. 14, 16) \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s request for administrative notice concerning Pakistan, along with \nrelated documents, is attached to the record.   \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004) and McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  \nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). Usually administrative notice in ISCR \nproceedings is accorded to facts that are either well known or derived from government \nreports. See Stein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing \nfifteen types of facts for administrative notice).  \n \nFindings of Fact2 \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in subparagraphs \n1.b to 1.d, 2.a, 2.b, and 2.d with mitigating explanations to be made at his hearing. (HE \n3) He denied the remaining allegations. His admissions are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make \nthe following findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is a 50-year-old linguist, who has been employed by defense \ncontractors for about eight years. In 1960, Applicant was born in Egypt. (Tr. 43) In 1979, \nhe moved to the United States. (Tr. 43,195) In 1990, he became a U.S. citizen. (Tr. 43) \nHe married his spouse in May 2007. (Tr. 149) He has two children from a pervious \nmarriage. (Tr. 41) He attended college from 1980 to 1983; however, he did not receive a \ndegree. (SF-86, GE 1)  \n \n \n2The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment, names of witnesses or locations \nto protect Applicant and his family\u2019s privacy. The cited sources contain more specific information. \nApplicant\u2019s October 10, 2006, May 14, 2007, and June 21, 2007, Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \ninterviews and his September 9, 2008, 33-page affidavit contain thorough descriptions of matters of security \nconcern. (GE 2, 4) \n \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                              \n                                           \nAfter September 11, 2001, Applicant and his father wanted to help the United \nStates against the terrorists. (Tr. 44-45) They both sought employment with the U.S. \nGovernment as linguists. (Tr. 44-45) Applicant\u2019s father was deployed as a linguist and \nanalyst to Guantanamo Bay for about four years,3 and Applicant was eventually \ndeployed to Iraq in 2003. (Tr. 45, 95) Applicant was assigned to a Marine Corps unit, \nwhich was one of the first units to enter Iraq in March 2003. (Tr. 47-48) He assisted in \nthe interrogations of prisoners of war, and helped locate weapons caches. (Tr. 48) He \nalso helped locate a captured U.S. servicemember. (Tr. 48-49) Applicant took great \npride in his assistance to U.S. forces, and in his role in fighting terrorists and the deaths \nand capture of terrorists in Iraq. (Tr. 49-50, 195) Applicant was under direct fire while \nserving in Iraq. (Tr. 50) After he was almost shot during a mission, the Marine Corps \nbattalion commander permitted Applicant to be armed. (Tr. 51) He wore a Marine Corps \nuniform while in the field supporting his Marine Corps unit. (Tr. 51) Applicant was \ndeployed to Fallujah during the battle in 2004. (Tr. 51)  \n \nApplicant had a good reputation as a linguist, and the FBI and CIA requested his \nassistance on many occasions. (Tr. 51-52) On June 12, 2006, Applicant returned to the \nUnited States from Southwest Asia. (Tr. 52)      \n \nApplicant currently owns a restaurant in the United States. (Tr. 42) He is married \nand has two children. (Tr. 41) His children are U.S. citizens and live in the United \nStates. \n \nLink to a known terrorist organization in Pakistan \n \nAn experienced counter-intelligence FBI special agent reviewed a classified \ndocument, relating to a closed FBI investigation, and provided an unclassified letterhead \nmemorandum which states, \u201cFBI investigation has determined a possible contact \nbetween [Applicant] and an entity in Pakistan which has been linked to a known terrorist \norganization.\u201d (Tr. 171-75; GE 3) The quoted sentence was part of the classified \ninvestigative report, and was not generated in response to DOHA\u2019s request for \ninformation about Applicant. (Tr. 172-73) The FBI \u201cassociated\u201d Applicant\u2019s phone \nnumber with an entity in Pakistan. (Tr. 178, 188) The association was through \nApplicant\u2019s telephone subscriber account. (Tr. 181-82) The FBI special agent was not \naware of when the investigation was conducted; however, he believed \u201cit\u2019s probably \nabout eight years old, eight to ten years old.\u201d (Tr. 180, 182) \u201c[I]t was in the 2000s.\u201d (Tr. \n182) He was not aware who made the telephone call, and he did not know whether \nApplicant was in the location to use his telephone when the call was made. (Tr. 183, \n188) A source mentioned Applicant\u2019s name, and what may have happened is they \nchecked Applicant\u2019s subscriber account. (Tr. 184-86) The FBI investigation containing \nthe reference to Applicant was not directed towards Applicant\u2019s activities. (Tr. 185) \nApplicant was merely a reference in the unrelated investigation. (Tr. 185) Applicant\u2019s \nphone calls were not monitored. (Tr. 188) Applicant\u2019s phone number and service \nprovider were not listed in the classified FBI summary. (Tr. 186) The FBI has no \ninvestigative report on Applicant, and declined to search the other investigative case file \nto determine when the call was made, the number called from, or the name of the \n \n3His father recently retired from driving limousines. (Tr. 96) \n\n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                              \n                                           \nsubscriber. (Tr. 187) In sum, anyone who had access to the phone that called Pakistan \ncould have made the call. (Tr. 188)   \n  \nApplicant denied any contact with anyone in Pakistan. (Tr. 53, 99, 195; SOR \u00b6 \n1.a) He suggested that if there was contact with an entity in Pakistan, the person who \ncalled was Applicant\u2019s son, who has the same name as Applicant. (Tr. 54; AE M) \nApplicant\u2019s son was born in 1984 in state N where the phone call was probably made to \nPakistan. In 2002 and in 2003, until he was deployed to Hungary, Applicant and his son \nlived in the same household in state N. (Tr. 191-92) His son was 18 or 19 years old at \nthat time. (AE M) Applicant was not aware that his son had any Pakistani friends at that \ntime. (Tr. 194)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s 26-year-old son has bipolar disorder and does not take his \nmedications.

And he said, I will do it myself because they\u2019re \ninfidels, anyway.\u201d (Tr. 57) Applicant\u2019s first wife obtained a restraining order against her \nson. (Tr. 57) In November 2009, Applicant notified the FBI of his concerns about his \nson. (Tr. 57-60, 93; AE T) Applicant provided a document to the FBI, and FBI agents \ncame to Applicant\u2019s restaurant and interviewed him. (Tr. 61)4 Applicant\u2019s son said he \nplanned to go to Iraq and join the fight against the United States, including against his \ncousin, who is a U.S. Marine, serving in Iraq. (Tr. 59)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s son and his parents currently live in state N. (Tr. 55, 94) Applicant left \nstate N in 2002.

(AE M)    \n \nApplicant said it was tough to inform the FBI about his own son; however, \n\u201cnational security is extremely important\u201d to him. (Tr. 93) He argued that he has proven \nhis integrity during his service overseas for the Marines, CIA and other U.S. \nGovernment agencies. (Tr. 92-93)  \n \nForeign influence concerns and Syria \n \nApplicant\u2019s 32-year-old spouse was born in the United States.

(Tr. 63, 153) Applicant and his spouse met in Kuwait, \nwhile pending deployment to Iraq. (Tr. 103-04)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s parents were born in Syria, and they are naturalized U.S. \ncitizens. (Tr. 62, 98, 150-51) Applicant did not believe his spouse had dual citizenship \nwith Syria. (Tr. 102) She does not have any siblings. (Tr. 63)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse has two aunts and three uncles on her mother\u2019s side of the \nfamily, and one uncle and three aunts on her father\u2019s side of the family. (Tr. 151) All of \nher aunts and uncles live in Syria. (Tr. 63, 151; SOR \u00b6 1.c) Her aunts have no \nrelationship to the Syrian Government. (Tr. 143-44) She contacts them or they contact \nher about three or four times a year. (Tr. 104-05, 143, 155) She is not very close to her \nother aunts. (Tr. 105) Applicant and his spouse were visited by her aunts, when they \nwere in Syria in 2007. (Tr. 106) After leaving Syria when she was 19, she has been to \nSyria once in 1999 (when she was 20) and once in 2007. (Tr. 109, 154) She is close to \nher cousin, who is a U.S. citizen and lives in the United States. (Tr. 155) She \ncommunicates with her cousin on a weekly basis. (Tr. 155) \n \nApplicant might communicate with his spouse\u2019s aunts once or twice a year to say \nhello or happy holidays, when they call to speak to Applicant\u2019s spouse.

Syria is approximately \nthe same size as North Dakota. Syria\u2019s population in 2009 is estimated to be about 21 \nmillion people. \n \nOfficially Syria is a republic; however, in reality it is ruled by an authoritarian \nregime. Syria is included on the U.S. State Department's List of State Sponsors of \nTerrorism. There are several known terrorist groups in Syria. The Syrian Government \ncontinues to provide political and material support to Hezbollah and Palestinian terrorist \ngroups. Several terrorist groups maintain their offices and some of their leadership in \nSyria. In addition, the Syrian Government permits Iran to transfer weapons and supplies \nthrough Syria to assist terrorists in Lebanon. Syria is one of the main transit points for \nforeign fighters entering Iraq. A travel warning for Syria warns about the risks of \nterrorism due to the September 2006 attack on the U.S. embassy in Damascus. Syrian \nforces killed the four individuals who attacked the U.S. embassy in 2006. There have \nbeen other attacks on the U.S. Ambassador's residence and the U.S. embassy in 1998 \nand 2000. \n \n\n \n8 \n                                                                                                                                              \nThe United States instituted economic sanctions against Syria due to their active \nand passive support of terrorism in the Middle East. No commercial aircraft owned or \noperated by the Syrian Government may take off or land in the United States. There are \nhuman rights abuses in Syria that include: systematic repression of Syrian citizens\u2019 \nability to peacefully change the government; arbitrary and unlawful deprivation of life; \ntorture and physical abuse of prisoners and detainees; arbitrary arrests and detentions; \nrestrictions on freedom of speech, press, assembly, and association; government \ncorruption; and violence and discrimination against women. Torture is occasionally \nused, including against foreign citizens. Security personnel have placed foreign visitors \nunder surveillance, have monitored telephones, and have searched hotel rooms and \npossessions of foreign citizens.  \n \n \nSyria opposed the Iraq war in 2003, and foreign relations between Syria and the \nUnited States deteriorated. In 2005, the United States withdrew its ambassador to Syria \nafter the assassination of Lebanese Prime Minister Hariri.   \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nIn 1989, Applicant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). \n(Tr. 65; SOR \u00b6 2.a; GE 4 at 7-8) His blood alcohol content was .14. (Tr. 110; GE 4 at 8) \nApplicant pleaded guilty, received a $250 fine, and six months of probation with \nsuspended license. (Tr. 65-66, 110-11; GE 4 at 8) He received alcohol counseling, and \nhe completed his sentence. (Tr. 65-66, 110-11) He did not have any subsequent \nalcohol-related incidents. (Tr. 66) He consumes moderate amounts of alcohol, and does \nnot drink alcohol before driving. (Tr. 109; GE 4 at 8) \n \nIn 1992, Applicant discovered that his fianc\u00e9e was seeing another man. (Tr. 67, \n112) He demanded that she return the engagement ring he gave her. (Tr. 67, 112; GE 4 \nat 7) He was devastated that she would cheat on him. (Tr. 116) There was an \nunpleasant argument. (Tr. 112) He said he would \u201cdo what it takes to get it back.\u201d (Tr. \n113) She perceived his statement as a threat because of the angry tone of his voice. \n(Tr. 113) She obtained a restraining order against Applicant. (Tr. 66, 111; SOR \u00b6 2.b; \nGE 4 at 5) He went to her door and knocked on it; however, he denied that he damaged \nher door by kicking it. (Tr. 114, 117-18; GE 4) She accused him of damage to property, \nobstructing a court order, and harassing communication, and the police arrested \nApplicant. (Tr. 67, 113-14; SOR \u00b6 2.c) He did not assault her and there was no mutual \naffray. (Tr. 112) Applicant said he was not arrested. (Tr. 68) He learned about the arrest \nwarrant and turned himself in to authorities. (Tr. 68, 117) He said her allegations were \nfalse, she withdrew her support for the charges before trial, and the charges were \ndismissed. (Tr. 67)  \n \nDefrauding a bank \n   \nA January 11, 1995 preliminary police report indicated on December 22, 1994, \nApplicant placed three empty deposit envelopes marked with $120, $120, and $50 in a \nbank in state F, and then withdrew $100 from his account, which had a negative \n\n \n9 \n                                                                                                                                              \n                                           \nbalance. (GE 4 at 8-9; GE 8)5 The report was in \u201cdefault\u201d status and was supposed to \nbe followed up with fingerprinting of the deposit envelopes. (GE 8) The offense is listed \nas \u201cFraud-false ID/impersonat\u201d and \u201cpetit theft.\u201d (GE 8) The bank provided videotapes of \nthe fraudulent deposits to the police. (GE 8) The police report states, \u201c[Applicant] \nadvised that he deposited $120. He than made a withdrawal of $60. At 1812 hrs, he \nreturned to the bank and placed a blank envelope into the drop off box advising that he \nwas depositing another $120. He than made a withdrawal for $40. At 1814 hrs, he \ndeposited an envelope into the drop off box advising that he deposited $50.\u201d (GE 8 at 4) \n \nThe police report does not indicate whether or not Applicant was arrested. (GE 8) \nApplicant denied that he attempted to defraud the bank, and asserted he was probably \naway at sea, working for a cruise ship when the offenses were committed. (Tr. 129-31) \nHe denied that he was ever in city B in 1995, where the offense occurred. (GE 4 at 8-9)6 \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s May 14, 2007 OPM PSI indicates he lived in city B where the \noffense occurred in 1997-1998 and was employed at \u201cP[]\u2019s restaurant,\u201d which is located \nin city B (GE 2 at 9) The 1995 police report indicates Applicant is employed at \u201cP[]\u2019s \nrestaurant,\u201d which is located in city B. (Compare GE 2 at 9 with GE 8 at 2) Applicant \nrecently contacted the police department in city B, where the report originated and was \nadvised they had no record of the incident. (Tr. 131)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s October 8, 2004 SF-86 indicates he worked at \u201cP[]\u2019s restaurant\u201d from \nMarch 1997 to June 1998. (GE 13) He worked at a cruise line in a different city in the \nstate F from January to September 1995. (GE 13) From September 1995 to March \n1997, he worked in a restaurant in state N. (GE 13) Applicant\u2019s October 8, 2004 SF-86 \ndid not indicate he ever lived in state F. (GE 13) \n \nApplicant addressed the non-SOR allegation that in 1998, Applicant wrote a bad \ncheck in Florida. (GE 4 at 1-2) The creditor provided a statement that there was no \nrecord of Applicant having a returned check. (AE U) \n \n \n \n \n5The SOR did not allege that Applicant committed the 1995 theft from a bank. In ISCR Case No. \n03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) the Appeal Board listed five circumstances in which conduct not \nalleged in an SOR may be considered stating:  \n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s evidence of \nextenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant \nhas demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of \nthe Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person \nanalysis under Directive Section 6.3.  \n \n(citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. 00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. \nOct. 24, 2003)). I have not considered this non-SOR allegation because it is not substantiated. I have not \nconsidered any of the other non-SOR allegations discussed in this decision for any purpose that \nnegatively reflects on Applicant\u2019s worthiness to hold a security clearance.  \n \n6Of course, the offense occurred in 1994, and the police report does not indicate when Applicant \nwas interviewed.  \n\n \n10 \n                                                                                                                                              \nInvolvement with prostitutes overseas from 2003 to 2005 \n \nFrom 2003 to 2005, Applicant had sexual encounters with prostitutes on \napproximately 15 occasions in two foreign countries. (Tr. 73-75, 132; SOR \u00b6 2.e; GE 4 \nat 25) Applicant\u2019s September 9, 2008 sworn statement to an OPM investigator \ndiscussed his involvement with prostitutes in two Southwest Asia countries: \n \nQ: How do you reconcile your relationship with your wife (girlfriend at the \ntime) and your solicitation of prostitutes at the same time? \nA: I was dating my wife during the last trip to [two Southwest Asian \ncountries in November 2004], but she was not with me in the country. I felt \nvery guilty after, however, it really hit me when she arrived and she told \nme that she missed me. I then made a vow never to do it again and to \nprove it to myself that I would be more devoted to her, I proposed to her \non 3 Apr 2005. I have never cheated on my wife since. \n \nQ: Does your wife now know of your conduct at the time? \nA: She knows of the [encounters with prostitutes prior to their dating \nrelationship], however [she] has no knowledge of the instances that \ntook place while we were dating. \n \nQ: What would occur if your wife found out about these encounters? \nA: She would be heartbroken. She would be extremely hurt. I don\u2019t think \nshe would leave me but it would take a lot to mend the hurt. \n \nQ: Can you be blackmailed with this information? \nA: No. I would inform my wife of my actions rather than being blackmailed \nto commit any acts against national security.  (emphasis added) GE 4 at \npage 26 of 33 pages.  \n  \nApplicant began dating his future wife on January 11, 2004. (Tr. 134, 157) At his \nhearing, he insisted the sexual encounters with prostitutes occurred before he started \ndating his future spouse. (Tr. 75; 134; 139-41) He said he may have encountered or \ntalked to prostitutes after January 11, 2004, because prostitutes frequent the same \nclubs and hotels as DoD contractors in two Southwest Asia countries. (Tr. 76-77, 132; \nGE 4 at 25) Applicant denied that he had sexual contact with any of the prostitutes after \nJanuary 11, 2004 (Tr. 76-77, 132-134, 139-41). Applicant was confronted with his \nSeptember 9, 2008 sworn statement, and Applicant responded: \n \nI didn\u2019t tell [the OPM investigator] I slept with prostitutes on every single \ntrip from 2003, 2004, and 2005. This is absolutely not true, sir. I did not \nsleep with any women period, never mind prostitutes, ever since I \nmet my wife on January 11th 2004. I just want to make that clear. I have \nno reason to sleep with any prostitutes. I am married to a wonderful lady, \na very great lady. I had no reason to even look further after I met her. \n(emphasis added) (Tr. 134) \n \n\n \n11 \n                                                                                                                                              \n*  *  * \n \nQ:  .  .  . [Your September 2008 statement indicates] \u201cDuring these stays, I \nmet with prostitutes. During each of the trips to [two Southwest Asia \ncountries], I solicited prostitutes about four times .  .  . \u201c \nA: That\u2019s correct.  \n \nQ: \u201cI was single with no commitments at the time.\u201d \nA: That\u2019s correct. \n   \nQ: [Your September 2008 statement continued,] \u201cAbout a year later, \nNovember of \u201904, I was deployed [and went to two Southwest Asia \ncountries for R&R].  \nA: Yes. \n \nQ: \u201cDuring both trips, I met with prostitutes.\u201d \nA: That is correct. \n \nQ: All right. What is the difference between soliciting and meeting? \nA: I mean, when I went to [two Southwest Asia countries], I specifically \nwent there to meet with and sleep with prostitutes. This is the main reason \nwhy I used to go. But after I met my wife, I continued to go to [two \nSouthwest Asia countries] with other friends, but never slept with \nprostitutes. I just met with them because they are almost impossible to \navoid. They are everywhere. (emphasis added) (Tr. 140-41) \n \nApplicant and his spouse agreed that he disclosed to his spouse his sexual \ncontacts with prostitutes before their dating relationship. (Tr. 78, 159-62) \n \nThreats to site manager in 2004 \n \nOn February 25, 2004, Applicant\u2019s site manager and a Human Relations (HR) \nAssistant Manager accused Applicant of calling the site manager on February 26, 2004, \nand stating Applicant would, \u201ckick your ass,\u201d \u201cyou\u2019re a liar,\u201d and \u201cyou better not let me \nsee you. I\u2019ll do something bad to you.\u201d (Tr. 79, 135; GE 11, GE 12, AE R) Applicant \nexplained that the site manager called Applicant \u201ca moron and stuff.\u201d (Tr. 80) Applicant \ndenied the site manager\u2019s allegations about Applicant threatening to kick the site \nmanager\u2019s ass, and promising to do something bad to him. (Tr. 135) Applicant\u2019s site \nmanager and the HR Assistant Manager said Applicant was upset that he was being \ntransferred from his present unit to Baghdad. (GE 11, 12)  \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant said that in January 2004, a new site manager in Iraq \n\u201cmade a pass at [Applicant\u2019s future spouse\u2019s] breasts.\u201d (Tr. 79, 135) Applicant said he \ntold the site manager to stay away from his girlfriend, otherwise he would report the site \nmanager to the company. (Tr. 136) (As indicated previously on page 10, Applicant said \nhis first date with his future spouse was on January 11, 2004.) On January 25, 2004, \nApplicant received a written counseling for insubordination and assault from the site \n\n \n12 \n                                                                                                                                              \nmanager. (Tr. 81; SOR \u00b6 2.f; GE 9) The January 25, 2004 counseling, which was \nwitnessed by the HR Assistant Manager, stated that Applicant admitted that he \nrequested a transfer to Baghdad, and then told members of his unit he was being forced \nto go to Baghdad by the site manager. (GE 9, 10)  \n \nThe site manager\u2019s MFR recommended to the site manager\u2019s company that \nApplicant be processed for termination based on his threatening and unprofessional \nbehavior as well as Applicant\u2019s opposition to the transfer. (Tr. 81; SOR \u00b6 2.g; GE 9, 11) \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s employer, which was a subcontractor of the site manager\u2019s \ncompany, doubted the credibility of the site manager\u2019s allegations, and rejected any \ndisciplinary action. (Tr. 82; AE R) Applicant stayed in country, and the site manager was \ntransferred out of country. (Tr. 83) Applicant left employment with the contractor in June \n2004. (AE Q) He provided a March 8, 2006 email from his employer asking Applicant to \nreturn to work for the company. (AE P) An October 26, 2009 email from his employer in \n2004 indicates their records show Applicant resigned from his employment; however, he \nis \u201celigible for rehire.\u201d (AE Q)  \n    \nFalsification of 2004 security clearance application (SF-86) \n \nOn October 8, 2004, Applicant completed an SF-86, which asked one question \nabout his alcohol-related offenses, and one question about serious criminal offenses: \n\u201cHave you ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or \ndrugs?\u201d and \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been arrested for, charged with, or convicted \nof any offense(s) not [previously] listed? (Leave out traffic fines of less than $150 unless \nthe violation was alcohol or drug related.)\u201d Applicant responded, \u201cNo\u201d to both questions. \nHe failed to disclose his DUI in 1989 and his arrest for impersonating a police officer in \n2002. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.h and 2.i; Tr. 85-86, 136)  \n \nApplicant explained that he failed to provide accurate information because he \nrushed through completion of the 2004 SF-86. (Tr. 85-86) This was his first SF-86, and \nhe thought he was supposed to list offenses in the last seven years. (Tr. 87, 137-38) He \ndisclosed the DUI to counterintelligence before his first deployment to Iraq about the \nsame time he completed the SF-86. (Tr. 138) He also thought he did not have to list \noffenses with fines of less than $150, and therefore he failed to list the arrest for \nimpersonating a police officer. (Tr. 89-90; GE 4 at 4-5) \n \nIn 2006, Applicant completed his SF-86. The facility security officer (FSO) told \neveryone that that was completing their SF-86 to be sure and list all drug and alcohol-\nrelated offenses, and that there was no time limit. (Tr. 88) He disclosed the 1989 DUI. \n(Tr. 88; GE 1) He also disclosed the disorderly conduct charge because his FSO said it \nshould be disclosed. (Tr. 90-91; GE 1) \n \nMisuse of badge and a unit coin \n \nApplicant donated money to the police department in state N, and he received a \nbadge indicating \u201cHonor Legion Police Department.\u201d (Tr. 70-71, 119-20) Applicant glued \nthe badge inside his wallet, hoping that if the police in state N stopped him for a traffic \n\n \n13 \n                                                                                                                                              \nviolation they would notice the badge and let him out of a traffic ticket. (GE 4 at 3, 31) In \nDecember 2002, Applicant and several linguists learned they were selected for a DoD \nprogram and were celebrating their assignments at a restaurant in state V. (Tr. 69) After \neating in the restaurant, they were waiting for a cab. (Tr. 70, 118-19) The bouncer told \nthem to wait outside; however, Applicant objected because it was cold outside. (Tr. 70, \n119) Applicant took the cab driver\u2019s card out of his wallet to show the card to the \nbouncer. (Tr. 120) When he opened his wallet, the bouncer evidently saw the badge for \nthe Honor Legion Police Department. Applicant was arrested later that evening for \nimpersonating a police officer. (Tr. 69-72, 118, 120; SOR \u00b6 1.d; GE 4 at 3-5)  \n \nWhen Applicant went to court, the judge dismissed the impersonating police \nofficer offense, and he pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and paid a $73 fine. (Tr. 69, \n72, 121) The reason he pleaded guilty to the disorderly conduct offense was because \nhe did not want to miss his deployment, and he did not want to hire a lawyer to contest \nthe offense. (Tr. 73) He denied that his conduct was disorderly. (Tr. 73)  \n \nApplicant bought a coin with a badge on it from an Air Force base exchange \n(BX). (Tr. 124; GE 4 at 5, 32) The unit coin was for the unit Applicant was supporting as \na contractor. (Tr. 125; GE 4 at 5) The BX sells the item with glue so that it can be placed \nin one\u2019s wallet. (Tr. 124) He purchased the item because he was proud of his \nassociation with the unit. (Tr. 125; GE 4 at 32) Most of the contractors he knew had the \nsame type of unit coin in their wallets. (Tr. 125) Applicant volunteered to an OPM \ninvestigator during his personal subject interview (PSI) that in 2005, an inspector \ngeneral officer (IG) noticed that Applicant had this item glued into the inside front of his \nwallet when he went into a club overseas. (Tr. 122-24; GE 4 at 5) Applicant was \naccused by another contractor of using the coin to obtain privileges from hotels or bars \nin Southwest Asian countries. Applicant got rid of the unit coin after the IG noticed it. \n(Tr. 125) Misuse of the unit coin was not listed as an SOR allegation, and is not \nsubstantiated as an offense. See n. 5, supra.   \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nA senior executive employed by a U.S. intelligence agency, who served with \nApplicant and his spouse in Southwest Asia, described Applicant as talented, hard \nworking, well-liked, and patriotic. (AE A) Applicant has a positive attitude towards his \nservice in support of missions, and expressed a sincere debt of gratitude to the United \nStates for helping his family. (AE A)  \n \nA DoD field counterintelligence specialist, who served with Applicant in \nSouthwest Asia from May 2003 to March 2004 and has known him for more than seven \nyears, lauded Applicant\u2019s contributions to mission accomplishment.

(AE B) Two U.S. Army captains, who served with Applicant in Southwest Asia \nin 2003-2004, made similar positive statements about Applicant\u2019s dedication and \nprofessionalism.

(AE C, D, G, K, L) \nThese certificates cite his professionalism, dedication, initiative, and loyalty. Id. He \nreceived a letter of appreciation in 2003 for his \u201csuperb assistance\u201d on a mission for a \nU.S. Marine Corps Expeditionary Unit serving in Southwest Asia. (AE F)   \n \nApplicant\u2019s award of the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal was signed \nby the Secretary of the Navy on May 6, 2003. (AE H) This award notes in part: \n \n[Applicant] spent many long, arduous hours translating during the \nmeetings of senior officers and key Iraqi officials, assisting in \ninterrogations of enemy prisoners of war, and debriefing civilians ranging \nfrom Saddam Hussein\u2019s senior leaders to common people on the street. \nHe worked tirelessly, often without sleep and under direct enemy fire. \nInterrogations that he helped to conduct resulted in information that helped \n[his Marine Corps battalion] capture key enemy facilities, paramilitary \nleaders and weapons caches. During the entire operation, he showed \nunyielding courage and dedication to his country and his fellow citizens. \n[Applicant] brings great credit upon himself and the United States of \nAmerica.   (AE H) \n \nA May 5, 2003, letter of appreciation from a Marine Corps counterintelligence \nelement described Applicant\u2019s extraordinary efforts on behalf of the U.S. war effort \nstating: \n \n[Applicant provided] critical information [though his interrogations of Iraqi \npersonnel] leading to the rescue of an American Prisoner of War,[7] the \ncapture of over 25 enemy paramilitary officers, countless weapons caches \nand the capture of the first enemy headquarters facility taken during the \nwar. [He] was pivotal in his role as a linguist, not only translating secret \nenemy documents and conducting simultaneous interpretation for \ncountless meetings, debriefings and interrogations, but doing all of that for \nover six weeks on an average of three hours [of] rest per day and often \nunder direct enemy fire. (AE I) \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \n \n7The identity of the American POW is restricted. (Tr. 48-49; GE 4 at 29) \n  \n\n \n15 \n                                                                                                                                              \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. Thus, nothing in this Decision \nshould be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on \nany express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. \nIt is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President \nand the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has repeatedly stated: \n \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n\u201cThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions and whole \nperson factors does not turn simply on a finding that one or more of them \napply to the particular facts of a case. Rather, their application requires the \nexercise of sound discretion in light of the record evidence as a whole.\u201d  \n\n \n16 \n                                                                                                                                              \n                                           \n \nISCR Case No. 09-01015 at 3 (App. Bd.

Dec. 19, 2008).  \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). The DOHA \nAppeal Board may reverse the administrative judge\u2019s \u201cdecision to grant, deny, or revoke \na security clearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.\u201d ISCR Case No. 07-\n16511 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 4, 2009) (citing Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3.).8 The \nfederal courts generally limit appeals to whether or not the agency complied with its own \nregulations.   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcerns are under Guidelines B (foreign influence) and E (personal conduct). \n \nForeign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates three conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n \n8See ISCR Case No. 09-03773 at 7 n. 4-6 (A.J. Jan. 29, 2010)(discussing appellate standards of \nreview). \n \n\n \n17 \n                                                                                                                                              \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and  \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nThe allegation that Applicant had \u201cpossible contact\u201d with \u201can entity in Pakistan \nwhich has been linked to a known terrorist organization\u201d (SOR \u00b6 1.a) is refuted. The FBI \ndid not provide the date of the possible contact, or the telephone number used to call \nthe Pakistani entity. Applicant may not have been in state N when the call was made to \nPakistan. Applicant denied making any contacts with anyone in Pakistan. Applicant\u2019s \nson has a criminal record and is mentally unstable. His son has adopted jihad, stated he \nwants to attack the United States, and he has threatened Applicant\u2019s former spouse \nbecause she is a Christian. Applicant\u2019s son or one of Applicant\u2019s son\u2019s friends may have \nused Applicant\u2019s telephone to call the entity in Pakistan associated with terrorism. It is \ntelling that the FBI never interviewed Applicant about the call to Pakistan, or made other \ninvestigative efforts to verify the contact. Applicant\u2019s honorable and brave service in Iraq \non behalf of the Marine Corps and a DoD intelligence service is inconsistent with \nallegiance to a known terrorist organization. In sum, there is insufficient evidence that \nApplicant contacted a Pakistani entity, and this allegation is resolved for Applicant.    \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(d) apply to Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s connection to Syria. \nApplicant\u2019s spouse was born in the United States, and then she lived in Syria from age \n3 to 19. She has five aunts and four uncles who currently live in Syria. She \ncommunicates with some of them three or four times per year. She traveled to Syria in \n1999 and 2007. Applicant shares living quarters with his spouse. He and his spouse \nvisited Syria in 2007, where they went for their honeymoon.    \n \nApplicant\u2019s spouse has a sufficient relationship with her aunts and uncles \nbecause of communications and visits to raise a security concern. \u201c[T]here is a \nrebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or obligation to, the \nimmediate family members of the person\u2019s spouse.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-03120, 2002 \nDOHA LEXIS 94 at *8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002). Although aunts and uncles are not \nimmediate family members, his spouse has a sufficient emotional connection with one \nor more of her Syrian aunts and uncles to establish a security concern. Applicant\u2019s \nrelationship with his spouse, and through her with her aunts and uncles creates \u201ca \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d \nbecause of Syria\u2019s \u201cdisregard for human rights, its sponsorship of terrorism, and its \n\n \n18 \n                                                                                                                                              \nantipathy to U.S. regional Interests\u201d See ISCR Case No. 09-03114 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. \n22, 2010) (discussing insufficient mitigation because of Syria\u2019s internal circumstances). \n \nSimilarly, Applicant and his spouse\u2019s relationships with one or more of her aunts \nand uncles living in Syria create a potential conflict of interest between Applicant\u2019s \n\u201cobligation to protect sensitive information or technology and [his] desire to help\u201d any of \nher family members who are in Syria. For example, if terrorists or the Syrian \nGovernment wanted to expose Applicant to coercion, they could exert pressure on his \nspouse\u2019s aunts and uncles.  \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a family member living in Syria is \nnot, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if an applicant or their \nspouse has a close relationship with even one relative, living in a foreign country, this \nfactor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially \nresult in the compromise of classified information. See generally ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).  \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or \nthe country is known to conduct intelligence collection operations against the United \nStates. The relationship of Syria with the United States places a significant, but not \ninsurmountable burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his spouse\u2019s \nrelationships with her family members living in Syria do not pose a security risk. \nApplicant should not be placed into a position where he might be forced to choose \nbetween loyalty to the United States and a desire to assist one of his spouse\u2019s aunts or \nuncles living in Syria, who might be coerced by the Syrian Government or terrorists \noperating in Syria.  \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States \nover matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, \nwe know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields. See ISCR Case No. 00-0317, \n2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  \n \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives from Syria or terrorists \nseek or have sought classified or economic information from or through Applicant, his \nspouse, or her relatives living in Syria, it is not possible to rule out such a possibility in \nthe future. International terrorist groups are known to conduct intelligence activities, and \nSyria has a problem with terrorism. Department Counsel produced substantial evidence \n\n \n19 \n                                                                                                                                              \nof Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s contacts with one or more of her aunts or uncles living in Syria \nand has raised the issue of potential foreign pressure or attempted exploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n7(a), 7(b), and 7(d) apply, and further inquiry is necessary about potential application of \nany mitigating conditions.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country \nis so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; \n  \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency \nrequirements regarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from \npersons, groups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n  \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) have limited applicability. Applicant visited Syria in 2007, \nwhich is recent. Applicant\u2019s spouse has frequent contact with her relatives in Syria. See \ngenerally ISCR Case No. 09-03114 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 22, 2010) (holding \ncommunications once a month were sufficient to be frequent). However, because of his \nconnections to his spouse, and her connections to relatives in Syria, Applicant is not \nable to fully meet his burden of showing there is \u201clittle likelihood that [his relationships \nwith his relatives who are Syria citizens] could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation.\u201d    \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) fully applies. A key factor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d Applicant has strong family \n\n \n20 \n                                                                                                                                              \nconnections to the United States. His spouse and two children are U.S. citizens. His \nspouse has a Top Secret DoD-issued security clearance and is a linguist. Applicant and \nhis spouse have served as linguists in Southwest Asia in a combat zone. Applicant\u2019s \nservice is especially noteworthy and includes exposure to direct enemy fire on multiple \noccasions in Iraq. \n \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the United States must be weighed against the \npotential conflict of interest created by his relationship with his spouse, and her \nrelationships with her aunts and uncles living in Syria. There is no evidence that \nterrorists, criminals, the Syrian Government, or those conducting espionage have \napproached or threatened Applicant, his spouse, or her family in Syria to coerce \nApplicant or his spouse for classified or sensitive information. As such, there is a \nreduced possibility that Applicant, Applicant\u2019s spouse, or Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s aunts and \nuncles living in Syria would be specifically selected as targets for improper coercion or \nexploitation. While the U.S. Government does not have any burden to prove the \npresence of such evidence, if such record evidence was present, Applicant would have \na heavy evidentiary burden to overcome to mitigate foreign influence security concerns. \nIt is important to be mindful of the United States\u2019 contentious relationship with Syria, and \nespecially Syria\u2019s support for terrorist groups and systematic human rights violations. \nSyria\u2019s conduct makes it more likely that Syria would coerce Applicant through his \nspouse\u2019s family, if Syria determined it was advantageous to do so. The fact that \nApplicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s family members living in Syria are unaware that he or his spouse \nhas U.S. Government-related employment or that they hold security clearances reduces \nthe risk that Applicant will be coerced through his spouse\u2019s family living in Syria; \nhowever, the risk is still substantial. Syrian intelligence agents and terrorists might learn \nthat Applicant or his spouse has a clearance through means other than his family living \nin Syria.     \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(d) and 8(e) do not apply. The U.S. Government has not encouraged \nApplicant or his spouse\u2019s involvement with her family members living in Syria. Applicant \nis not required to report his contacts with his spouse\u2019s family members living in Syria. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(f) does not apply because it is only available to mitigate concerns raised \nby property interests in Syria under AG \u00b6 7(e). Applicant and his spouse do not have \nany property interests or investments in Syria.  \n \nIn sum, the primary foreign influence security concern is Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s \nrelationships with her aunts and uncles living in Syria. These relatives live in Syria and \nare readily available for coercion. The Syrian Government\u2019s antipathy towards the \nUnited States and failure to follow the rule of law further increase the risk of coercion. \nHowever, Applicant and his spouse have made extraordinary contributions to the United \nStates war effort as linguists in Southwest Asia. Those contributions demonstrate their \n\u201cdeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S.,\u201d and I am confident that \nApplicant will \u201cresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d See AG \u00b6 \n8(b).  \n \n \n\n \n21 \n                                                                                                                                              \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes four conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying with respect to the SOR allegations in this case: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning \nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent \nmedical authority, or other official government representative;  \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes \nbut is not limited to consideration of:  .  .  . (3) a pattern of dishonesty or \nrule violations; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such \nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \n \nThere is sufficient evidence to apply AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a), 16(b), 16(d), and 16(e). When \nApplicant completed his 2004 SF-86, he did not disclose his 1989 DUI, and he did not \ndisclose his 2002 arrest for impersonating an officer. There is also substantial evidence \nthat he violated a restraining order in 1992, had sexual encounters with prostitutes in \ntwo Southwest Asia countries in 2003 and 2004, committed the 1989 DUI, engaged in \nthe disorderly conduct in 2002, and threatened bodily harm to his supervisor in \nSouthwest Asia in 2004. His behavior violates multiple statutes and rules.  \n  \n\n \n22 \n                                                                                                                                              \nCertainly, such crimes and rule violations violate important civil and criminal rules \nin our society, and these offenses are conduct a person might wish to conceal, as it \nadversely affects a person\u2019s professional and community standing.  Thus, AG \u00b6 16(e)(1) \napplies and further inquiry concerning the applicability of mitigating conditions is \nrequired.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 lists seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \nAG \u00b6 17(f) applies to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.f to 2.i. As to the allegations in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.f and 2.g, Applicant denied that he threatened his site manager with bodily \ninjury. He attributed the site manager\u2019s allegations to Applicant\u2019s threat to tell his site \nmanager\u2019s supervisor about the site manager\u2019s inappropriate sexual advances towards \nhis future spouse. Applicant\u2019s company doubted the credibility of the site manager\u2019s \nallegation, and Applicant did not receive any disciplinary action. \n\n \n23 \n                                                                                                                                              \n                                           \nThe allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.g and 2.h are that he failed to disclose9 derogatory \ncriminal information on his 2004 SF-86. Applicant credibly denied that he intentionally \nfailed to disclose his 1989 DUI and 2002 arrest for impersonating a police officer on his \n2004 SF-86. He explained that he hurried through the completion of his SF-86 and \nfailed to disclose the 1989 DUI because it was more than seven years previously, and \nhe did not disclose his 2002 arrest because it resulted in a $73 fine for disorderly \nconduct. In 2004, he did not consult with his security officer concerning these issues. In \n2006, Applicant\u2019s security officer advised him that he needed to disclose all alcohol-\nrelated offenses regardless of the passage of more than seven years, and \nmisdemeanor-criminal arrests, even though the fine was less than the $150 threshold in \nthe SF-86 question. Applicant complied with this advice, and disclosed both arrests on \nhis 2006 SF-86. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) to 17(e) apply to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a to 2.d. Applicant\u2019s \n1989 DUI was 22 years ago, and no other alcohol-related offenses have occurred. \nApplicant\u2019s 1992 violation of the restraining order was relatively minor and did not result \nin a conviction or physical harm to the victim. Applicant\u2019s 2002 impersonation of a police \nofficer and 2005 misuse of a unit coin are not substantiated. His 2002 disorderly \nconduct is substantiated; however, it is a relatively minor, isolated offense that resulted \nin a $73 fine. \n \n  The mitigating condition outlined in AG \u00b6 17(e), \u201cthe individual has taken \npositive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \nduress\u201d applies to all of Applicant\u2019s offenses, except for the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.e. \nSecurity officials and Applicant\u2019s spouse are well aware of the issues raised by the \nallegations in the SOR. His conduct is well-documented in law enforcement and security \nrecords. The federal government\u2019s knowledge of these allegations eliminates any \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation or duress. I do not believe Applicant would \ncompromise national security to avoid public disclosure of these offenses.  \n \nThe allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.e is not fully mitigated. Applicant\u2019s sexual conduct with \nprostitutes in Southwest Asia remains a security concern because Applicant was \nevasive or deceptive at his hearing about his conduct with prostitutes after he began \ndating his future spouse on January 11, 2004. His September 9, 2008 statement to an \nOPM investigator was more credible than his statement at his hearing about his conduct \n \n9The Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification cases, stating:\n \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has the burden of \nproving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to conclude \nDepartment Counsel had established a prima facie case under Guideline E and the \nburden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to present evidence to explain the \nomission.  \n \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 (App. Bd. June 9, \n2004)). \n\n \n24 \n                                                                                                                                              \n                                           \nwith prostitutes after January 11, 2004. He was unwilling to be fully candid at his \nhearing about why he was ashamed of his conduct with the prostitutes, and his \nexpressed rationale to the OPM investigator is the probable motive for his failure to the \ncandid at his hearing. He did not want his spouse to know that he continued to engage \nin some type of sexual conduct with prostitutes after they began dating.     \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines B and E in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) \nwere addressed under this guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nThere are some facts supporting mitigation of security concerns; however, they \nare insufficient to fully mitigate all concerns. In regard to the foreign influence concerns \nraised by Applicant\u2019s spouse\u2019s aunts and uncles living in Syria under the whole-person \nconcept, consideration must be given to the geopolitical situation in Syria, as well as the \ndangers existing in Syria.10 The danger of violence or coercion from terrorists in Syria \nand the threat of coercion from the Syrian Government make coercion and abuse more \nlikely than in many other countries. Terrorists continue to threaten the interests of the \nUnited States, as well as those who cooperate and assist the United States. Syria has \nprovided support for terrorist groups and shown some hostility towards United States \nefforts in Iraq, Israel, Palestine, and Lebanon.   \n     \nIn 1979, Applicant immigrated to the United States. In 1990, he became a U.S. \ncitizen. Applicant\u2019s spouse and son were born and live in the United States. Applicant \nand his spouse have served with U.S. forces in Southwest Asia. Applicant significantly \ncontributed to mission accomplishment of U.S. forces in Iraq. Applicant was under direct \nenemy fire on multiple occasions. Applicant and his spouse are absolutely loyal to the \n \n10 See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd. May 23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient \ndiscussion of geopolitical situation and suggesting expansion of whole-person discussion). \n  \n\n \n25 \n                                                                                                                                              \nUnited States. They love the United States and consider the United States to be their \nhome, and not Syria. The connections to Syria are too attenuated and limited to \noutweigh Applicant\u2019s connections to the United States and past service to the \nDepartment of Defense.  \n \nApplicant provided exceptionally positive character evidence. His performance as \na linguist in 2003-2006 in Southwest Asia was truly extraordinary. His efforts under \ndangerous, arduous conditions result in important mitigation of security concerns. His \n2003 award of the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal by the Secretary of the \nNavy and 2003 letter of appreciation from a Marine Corps counterintelligence element, \nquoted starting at page 14, provide a detailed description of his heroism, dedication and \nbravery. Multiple character statements and certificates of appreciation laud Applicant\u2019s \ndependability, competence, professionalism, loyalty, and trustworthiness.  \n \nNevertheless, the circumstances tending to support revocation of his security \nclearance are too significant to be mitigated at this time under the whole-person \nconcept. Applicant\u2019s sexual conduct with prostitutes in Southwest Asia continued until \nafter January 11, 2004, as indicated in his September 2008 OPM PSI. Applicant was \nevasive or deceptive at his hearing about his conduct with prostitutes after he began \ndating his future spouse on January 11, 2004. Applicant\u2019s September 9, 2008 statement \nto an OPM investigator was more credible than his statement at his hearing about his \nconduct with prostitutes after January 11, 2004. He was unwilling to be fully candid \nabout why he was ashamed of his conduct with the prostitutes because he did not want \nhis spouse to know that he continued to engage is some type of sexual conduct with \nprostitutes after they began dating.     \n \nAfter weighing all the facts and circumstances in this decision, including \nApplicant\u2019s demeanor, sincerity, and honesty at his hearing, I conclude he has not fully \nhonest or candid concerning his involvement with prostitutes in Southwest Asia after \nJanuary 11, 2004, and SOR \u00b6 2.e cannot be mitigated.  \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude foreign influence concerns \nare mitigated; however, personal conduct concerns are not fully mitigated. For the \nreasons stated, I conclude he is not eligible for access to classified information.  \n \n\n \n26 \n                                                                                                                                              \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:    \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.d: \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:    \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a to 2.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.e:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.f to 2.i:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n____________________________ \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

His eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \nOn October 24, 2005, Applicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF \n86). On December 14, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline \nB for Applicant. The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn January 17, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to have \nthe case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On February 13, 2008, \nApril 17, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing six Items, \nand mailed Applicant a complete copy on February 15, 2008. Applicant received the \nFORM on February 27, 2008, and had 30 days from its receipt to file objections and \nsubmit additional information. Department Counsel did not object to the additional \nevidence Applicant submitted on March 14, 2008. DOHA assigned the case to me on \nMarch 21, 2008. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \n \nWithin the FORM, Department Counsel submitted a formal request that I take \nadministrative notice of certain facts relating to India, along with 12 attachments.  In \nApplicant\u2019s Response to Department Counsel\u2019s FORM, he extrapolated additional facts \nfrom the Government\u2019s attachments for which he seeks administrative notice. The facts \nadministratively noticed are limited to matters of general knowledge and matters not \nsubject to reasonable dispute. Those facts are set out in the Findings of Fact, below. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations contained in \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.e and 1.f. He denied the allegation contained in \u00b6 1.c and provided an \nexplanation. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact.

He attended an Indian \nengineering college and earned a bachelor of technology degree in June 1991. After \ngraduating from college, he moved to the United States for graduate school. From \nSeptember 1991 to May 1993, he attended a well-known school in the United States, \nwhere he earned a Masters of Science degree in May 1994.

He has lived in the United States for \nmore than 16 years. He identifies himself \u201cexclusively and proudly as a United States \ncitizen.\u201d  (Item 4 at 7). \n \n \n \nApplicant married his spouse in July 1992. She was born in India and became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen in May 2004. They have two children, both born in the United \nStates. His wife\u2019s parents are resident citizens of India. His father-in-law is a doctor, \nworking in the private sector and his mother-in-law is a housewife. He has limited \ncontact with them, speaking to them once every few months. (Item 4). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are resident citizens of India, as is his sister. Since retiring \nfrom private industry in 2003, his father has operated a small business, which works \nwith private industry and not the Indian government. His mother is a housewife. His \n\n \n3 \n \n \nsister is a physician, who practices in a private hospital. He contacts his father once \nevery two to four weeks, and speaks to his mother, sister and in-laws every couple \nmonths. (Item 4).  His brother is a citizen of India, residing in the United States. \n \n \nIn or about August 1998, Applicant started his own company for which he is the \nCEO. The company employs more than 200 employees, and contracts with numerous \nfederal agencies, including the Department of Defense, as well as private commercial \nclients. It provides professional services to its customers in various fields and areas. For \na period of time, Applicant subcontracted with his father\u2019s company to perform certain \nservices for Applicant\u2019s clients. The contract represented approximately 1.33% of \nApplicant\u2019s $18 million total revenue. In January 2008, Applicant terminated the contract \nbetween the two companies as a result of the Government\u2019s security concerns. He has \nno other foreign business or property interests. (Item 4). Applicant\u2019s father has never \nhad a financial interest in Applicant\u2019s company.  Applicant held an interim security \nclearance from 2004 until late 2007 without any evidence of adverse incidents. (Item 4 \nat 7). \n \n \nIndia \n \n \nAccording to its constitution, India is a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic \nrepublic. It is a multiparty, federal, parliamentary democracy with a bicameral parliament \nand a population of approximately 1.1 billion.  \n \nThe Indian government generally respects the rights of its citizens, but numerous \nserious problems remain. Police and security forces have engaged in extrajudicial \nkillings of persons in custody, disappearances, torture, and rape. The lack of \naccountability permeated the government and security forces, creating an atmosphere \nin which human rights violations went unpunished. A number of violent attacks have \nbeen committed in recent years by separatist and terrorist groups. \n \nThe U.S. recognizes India as key to strategic interests and has sought to \nstrengthen its relationship with India. The two countries are the world\u2019s largest \ndemocracies, both committed to political freedom protected by representative \ngovernment, and share common interests in the free flow of commerce, in fighting \nterrorism, and in creating a strategically stable Asia. However, differences over India\u2019s \nnuclear weapons program and pace of economic reform exist. There are also concerns \nabout India\u2019s relations with Iran, including their increasing cooperation with the Iranian \nmilitary. \n \nThere have been cases involving the illegal export, or attempted illegal export, of \nU.S. restricted, dual use technology to India, including technology and equipment which \nwere determined to present an unacceptable risk of diversion to programs for the \ndevelopment of mass destruction or their means of delivery. Foreign government \nentities, including intelligence organizations and security services, have capitalized on \nprivate-sector acquisitions of U.S. technology, and acquisition of sensitive U.S. \n\n \n4 \n \n \ntechnology by foreign private entities does not slow its flow to foreign governments or its \nuse in military applications. \n \nThe U.S. views India as a growing world power with which it shares common \nstrategic interests. There is a strong partnership between the two countries and they are \nexpected to continue to address differences and shape a dynamic and collaborative \nfuture. The U.S. and India are seeking to elevate the strategic partnership further to \ninclude cooperation in counter-terrorism, defense cooperation, education, and joint \ndemocracy promotion. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used to evaluate \nan Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \n\n \n5 \n \n \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the Government\u2019s security concern regarding foreign influence: \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 describes four conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;1 \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual's desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; \n (d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n                                                          \n1The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of \nlaw, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an \napplicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign \ninfluence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(e) a substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which \ncould subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation. \nApplicant has frequent contact with his father, who is a resident citizen of India. \nHe has less frequent contacts with his mother, sister, and in-laws. However, these \nrelationships with family members create a heightened risk of foreign pressure or \nexploitation because entities in India have sought U. S. intelligence or proprietary \ninformation. His connections to his family also create a potential conflict of interest \nbecause the relationships are sufficiently close in nature and could raise a security \nconcern over his desire to help his family, including his wife\u2019s mother and father. Prior to \nJanuary 2008, Applicant subcontracted with his father\u2019s Indian company to perform \nwork for Applicant\u2019s clients. That relationship also created a security concern, albeit a \nlimited concern, given the small amount of money involved.  \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of those four disqualifying \nconditions and the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove \nmitigation. Four of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially applicable:  \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and (c) have some application to Applicant\u2019s relationships with \nhis parents, sister and in-laws. None of those relatives are in positions connected \nwith the Indian government or engaged in activities that would likely cause \nApplicant to be exploited or placed in a position of having to choose between \nthem and the United States. Applicant\u2019s contacts with his family appear to be \n\n \n7 \n \n \ninfrequent, in general, but it is not clear that they are so casual that they could \nnot create any risk of foreign influence.    \nApplicant established the application of AG \u00b6 8(b).  Based on his \nrelationship and depth of loyalty to the United States, he can be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of U.S. interests. He has lived in the \nUnited States since 1991 when he arrived to attend graduate school. After \nearning his advanced degree, he began working here and ultimately started a \nU.S. company that employs over 200 people with gross receipts of $18 million. \nHe became a U.S. citizen in May 2004, as did his wife.  Both of his children were \nborn in the U.S.  In contrast, his ties to India have become minimal over the \nyears. He renounced his Indian citizenship and does not have any financial or \nproperty interests there. He has infrequent communication with five relatives, \nliving there. Over the course of 13 years, he visited India nine times for \nrecreational purposes, the last visit occurring about three years ago.  \nApplicant also established the application of AG \u00b6 8(f) to the security \nconcern raised under AG \u00b6 7(e). In response to the Government\u2019s concerns, \nApplicant terminated the subcontracts he had with his father\u2019s company in \nJanuary 2008. Given that the value of those dealings was approximately 1.33% \n(about $240,000) of his $18 million gross revenues, the likelihood that the prior \narrangement would have created a conflict for him was miniscule.   \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nIn addition to evaluating the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each \nguideline, the adjudicative process requires thorough consideration and review of all \navailable, reliable information about the applicant, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, to arrive at a balanced decision. The essence of scrutinizing all appropriate \nvariables in a case is referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis. In evaluating the \nconduct of the applicant, the Administrative Judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). Those factors include:  (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nThe Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an \napplicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family\u2019s ties to the \nU.S. relative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her ties social ties within the \n\n \n8 \n \n \nU.S.; and many others raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at \n7 (App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).   \n \n \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs towards granting Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance. Applicant is a mature person. He has lived in the United States for 16 years, \nand has been a naturalized citizen for the past four. Applicant\u2019s spouse has been living \nin the United States since 1992 and is a naturalized citizen. His two children were born \nin the United States. He earned an advanced degree from a U.S. institution. He is a \nsuccessful member of his business community, providing services to the U.S. \ngovernment and private industry. He held an interim security clearance for over four \nyears without evidence of adverse incidents. His ties to the United States are much \nstronger than his ties to five relatives living in India. There is no evidence he has ever \ntaken any action that could cause potential harm to the United States. He takes his \nloyalty to the United States seriously, and renounced his Indian citizenship after taking \nhis U.S. oath of citizenship, in addition to surrendering his Indian passport. There is not \nany derogatory information about him in the record.  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant mitigated the \nsecurity concerns pertaining to foreign influence.2 Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme without questions as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from \nforeign influence. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n                                                          \n2 I conclude that the whole person analysis weighs heavily toward approval of Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance. Assuming a higher authority reviewing this decision determines the mitigating conditions \narticulated under AG \u00b6 8 do not apply and severs any consideration of them, I conclude the whole person \nanalysis standing alone is sufficient to support approval of a security clearance in this case. \n",

On May 8, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals\n(DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security\nconcerns under Guideline B and Guideline C that provided the basis for its action to\ndeny him a security clearance and refer the matter to an administrative judge. The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense as of September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on June 4, 2008, and requested a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on June 30, 2008. On\nJuly 15, 2008, I scheduled a hearing for August 14, 2008. The parties appeared as\nSeptember 16, 2008\n\n2\nscheduled. Three government exhibits (Ex. 1-3) and three Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-C)\nwere admitted and Applicant testified on his behalf. A transcript (Tr.) of the hearing was\nreceived by DOHA on August 26, 2008. Based on review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, and the facts for administrative notice, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nOn June 25, 2008, Department Counsel requested administrative notice be taken\nof certain facts relating to Egypt and its foreign relations, including with the United\nStates (U.S.). The request was based on publications from the U.S. State Department.\nThe government\u2019s formal request and the attached documents were not admitted into\nevidence but were included in the record. \nOn July 7, 2008, I notified the parties of my intention to take administrative notice\nof specific facts, subject to revision based on the evidence admitted at the hearing and\nany valid objections. The parties were granted until July 21, 2008, to file any objections,\nand for Applicant to propose facts for administrative notice. Neither party responded by\nthe due date. Before the introduction of any evidence at Applicant\u2019s hearing, I confirmed\nthe parties had no objections. I agreed to take administrative notice of particular facts\npertaining to Egypt and its relations with the U.S., as set forth below.\nMotion to Amend SOR\nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.17 of the Directive, Department Counsel moved before closing\nargument to amend SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b to reflect that Applicant\u2019s ex-wife (spouse #2)\nand his eldest daughter are resident citizens of Egypt based on the evidence showing\nthat he and his second wife had a daughter, not a son, that they had again divorced\nfollowing their remarriage, and that his ex-wife and their daughter live in Egypt.\nDepartment Counsel also moved to add SOR \u00b6 1.e under Guideline B, to conform to the\nevidence showing Applicant shares ownership of a house in Egypt with his siblings.\nApplicant did not object and the motion was granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn the amended SOR, DOHA alleges under Guideline B, foreign influence, that\none of Applicant\u2019s former wives (SOR \u00b6 1.a), his eldest daughter (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and his\nmother, three sisters, and brother (SOR \u00b6 1.c) are resident citizens of Egypt; that he\nmaintains contact with his mother and siblings once weekly by telephone (SOR \u00b6 1.c),\nand that he traveled to Egypt in 1993, 1997, 2004, 2006, and 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). DOHA\nalleges under Guideline C that Applicant exercises dual citizenship with Egypt and the\nU.S. (SOR \u00b6 2.a) and that he holds an expired Egyptian passport which he used to\ntravel to Egypt after he became a U.S. citizen as it allowed him to enter without a visa\n(SOR \u00b6 2.b). Applicant indicated in his response to the SOR that he got divorced in\n\nApplicant testified he entered the U.S. in January 1986 (Tr. 40), and his Egyptian passport bears a visa stamp\n1\n(albeit barely legible) of January 7, 1986. He further testified that he met his first wife while here as a tourist\nand that he married her the same month they met (Tr. 68-69). He indicated on his e-QIP that their marriage\ntook place in October 1986 in the U.S. (Ex. 1). His Egyptian passport also shows that he had been processed\nin 1987 for I-551, temporary evidence of lawful admission for permanent residence. It appears that he was\nin the U.S. for sometime before he met his spouse. His lawful admission on a spousal visa dates from early\n1987.\n3\nMarch 2008, and that his former wife and his eldest daughter reside in Egypt. He\notherwise admitted the allegations but expressed his willingness to renounce his\nEgyptian citizenship \u201cif this is the problem\u201d and to destroy his expired Egyptian passport\n\u201cbecause it is no good.\u201d After considering the evidence of record, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 52-year-old test technician who has worked for the same defense\ncontractor since April 2001 (Ex. 1). He seeks a secret security clearance, never having\npreviously held a U.S. security clearance (Tr. 69).\n Applicant is the second of five children (two sons and then three daughters) born\nin Egypt to resident citizens of that country (Ex. 1). He was educated in Egypt, and\nearned his bachelor of science degree in electrical engineering from a preeminent\nuniversity in Egypt in July 1978. From April 1979 to July 1980, he served on inactive\nreserve in the Egyptian army (Ex. 1).\nIn 1981, Applicant had some computer training in the U.S. (Tr. 67). He returned to\nthe U.S. as a tourist in January 1986, on an Egyptian passport issued to him in\nDecember 1985 and valid for seven years (Ex. 3). While in the U.S., he met his first wife,\na U.S. native citizen, at a donut shop (Tr. 68). They married in the U.S. in October 1986\n(Ex. 1, Tr. 67-68).   They divorced in about December 1987 (Ex. 1).\n1\nApplicant traveled to Egypt on at least an annual basis from 1988 to 1991. His\nEgyptian passport shows he entered the U.S. in September 1988, November 1989,\nAugust 1990, and July 1991 (Ex. 3). \nApplicant applied for U.S. citizenship as soon as he was eligible (Tr. 41), and in\nFebruary 1993, he became a naturalized U.S. citizen (Ex. 1). He took no action at that\ntime to formally renounce his Egyptian citizenship. He obtained a U.S. passport (Tr. 41-\n42), but also retained the Egyptian passport that expired in December 1992. Applicant\ntook both his expired Egyptian and his valid U.S. passports with him on subsequent trips\nto Egypt. He showed both passports to Egyptian border control to prove that he was born\nin Egypt so that he would not have to obtain a visa to enter on his U.S. passport (Tr. 38).\nIn October 1993, Applicant married an Egyptian native (spouse #2) in Egypt. They\nhad a daughter (daughter #1) born to them in Egypt in October 1994. Applicant returned\n\nThe duration of Applicant\u2019s stay in Egypt is unclear. In light of the birth of his daughter one year after his\n2\nwedding date, Applicant would have had to stay in Egypt for at least a few months after his marriage.\nApplicant indicated in his e-QIP that they were first divorced on May 11, 1997 (Ex. 1). The divorce certification\n3\nof March 2008 that dissolved their second marriage indicates that she was \u201cfirstly divorced revocable\u201d on\nJanuary 11, 1997 (Ex. C).\n4\nto the U.S. while his spouse and daughter remained behind in Egypt.  In 1997, Applicant\n2\nand spouse #2 divorced (Ex. 1).  In mid-June 1997, Applicant got married in Egypt to his\n3\nthird wife (spouse #3), a native of Saudi Arabia. Applicant sponsored her immigration to\nthe U.S. In July 1998, a daughter was born to them in the U.S. They had a second child,\na son, born in the U.S. in November 1999 (Ex. 1, Ex. 3). Applicant did not inquire into\nwhether his children acquired derivative Egyptian citizenship, although the U.S. State\nDepartment reports that Egypt considers all children born to Egyptian males to be\ncitizens of Egypt (see infra). He has never applied for Egyptian citizenship for them, and\nthey have never held Egyptian passports (Tr. 43-44). In April 2001, Applicant went to\nwork for his present employer (Ex. 1). In April 2003, Applicant renewed his U.S. passport\nfor another ten years.\nApplicant, spouse #3, and their two children, traveled to Egypt in March 2004 (Tr.\n54). As he had before, he presented his expired Egyptian passport at the Egyptian\nairport to avoid having to obtain a visa on his U.S. passport (Ex. 1, Ex. 3, Tr. 40, 56).\nApplicant stayed with his mother, while spouse #3 and the children stayed with her\nmother, as he and spouse #3 were having marital problems (Tr. 55). He was granted a\ndivorce from spouse #3 in Egypt (Ex. 1), and the following day, he remarried spouse #2\n(Ex. 1). When Applicant left Egypt in April 2004 (Ex. 1), spouse #2 and daughter #1\nstayed behind. In January 2006, Applicant traveled to Egypt. He sponsored spouse #2's\nimmigration, and in about February 2006, spouse #2 and daughter #1 came to the U.S.\nfor the first time (Ex. 1).\n On March 23, 2006, Applicant executed an e-QIP. He disclosed his birth in Egypt\nbut responded \u201cNo\u201d to whether he maintained dual citizenship since his naturalization in\nthe U.S. in February 1993. Applicant disclosed his prior marriage to spouse #3 who had\nacquired U.S. citizenship, and his re-marriage to spouse #2, an Egyptian citizen.\nApplicant disclosed the Egyptian citizenship and residency of his mother and siblings.\nHis father was deceased. He listed trips to Egypt in March/April 2004 and January 2006.\nApplicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to question 17.a concerning whether he had any foreign\nproperty, business connections, or financial interests. At his hearing, he acknowledged\nthat he had inherited property in Egypt with his siblings on his father\u2019s death (Tr. 65).\nAbout four months after they had immigrated to the U.S., spouse #2 and daughter\n#1 returned to Egypt to live (Tr. 44, 46). In March 2007, Applicant went to Egypt for a\ncouple of weeks to see his mother (Ex. 3, Tr. 59). He spent the entire time with his family\n(Tr. 60). On December 27, 2007, Applicant was interviewed by a government\ninvestigator about, in part, his foreign connections. Applicant indicated that he held dual\ncitizenship with Egypt and the U.S. because he had not had a reason to renounce his\nEgyptian citizenship and it allowed him to enter Egypt without a visa. Applicant denied\n\n5\nany conflict between his obligations to his family members in Egypt, and the U.S., which\nhe averred held his \u201cultimate loyalty.\u201d He indicated he would have no problem\nrenouncing his Egyptian citizenship. Applicant provided details of his siblings\nemployments in Egypt, and indicated that his relatives in Egypt are aware that he is\nbeing considered for a position of national security (Ex. 2).\nOn February 1, 2008, Applicant responded to DOHA interrogatories concerning\nhis use and possession of an Egyptian passport. He explained he showed his expired\nEgyptian passport at the Cairo airport so that he would not need a visa, but that he was\nwilling to destroy, surrender, or invalidate the foreign passport because it expired a long\ntime ago. He denied any intent to renew his expired Egyptian passport. Applicant\nexpressed plans to travel to Egypt \u201cin the next few months for 2 weeks max. to see [his]\nmother\u201d (Ex. 3).\nIn March 2008, Applicant traveled to Egypt where he obtained a divorce from\nspouse #2 (Ex. B, Tr. 53). He stayed with his mother but also visited with daughter #1\n(Tr. 76). As he had on previous trips, Applicant took both his U.S. and expired Egyptian\npassports (Tr. 39). His U.S. passport was stamped by a border official (Ex. B), but he\nwas informed that his Egyptian passport was invalid so he should not use it in the future.\nApplicant was led to understand that it would be sufficient to present only his U.S.\npassport on future trips since it notes his birth in Egypt (Tr. 39). At his hearing, he ripped\npages out of the expired Egyptian passport in an effort to prove he would not use it again\n(Tr. 97).\nSpouse #3 and their two children continue to reside in the U.S. (Tr. 42). He sees\nhis children every weekend (\u201cWell, these two kids are everything in my life.\u201d Tr. 47), and\ntelephones them daily (Tr. 48). Applicant pays child support of $217 per week for his\nchildren in the U.S. (Tr. 52).\nApplicant talks to daughter #1 in Egypt once a week. He does not speak to his ex-\nwife living in Egypt unless he has a reason to do so (Tr. 49). Applicant does not believe\nshe has remarried, but he is not sure (Tr. 50). In March 2008, he began voluntary\npayments of 1,200 Egyptian pounds (about $230 USD) monthly to support his daughter\nin Egypt (Tr. 52, 72). He had not previously paid any child support for her (Tr. 81). His\nex-wife is an attorney employed in a municipal office that processes power of attorney\ndocuments (Tr. 75). She has access to his bank account in the U.S. through an ATM\ncard (Tr. 74), and withdraws the 1,200 Egyptian pounds the first of every month (Tr. 75).\nOn all of his visits to Egypt, Applicant saw his mother and his siblings (Tr. 55-56,\n61). Applicant sends his mother money when she needs it, about $100 every two or\nthree months (Tr. 62). He fell behind in a student loan obligation because of financial\nsupport sent to his mother in Egypt but was making $120 monthly payments toward the\n$10,000 debt as of December 2007 (Ex. 2). Applicant telephones his mother once a\nweek to check on her well-being. He speaks to his siblings if they happen to be at his\nmother\u2019s home when he calls, but he does not telephone them at their homes (Tr. 63).\nApplicant last spoke to his brother in May or June 2008 and to his sisters the previous\n\n6\nmonth (Tr. 64). Applicant told his relatives in Egypt that he had applied for a security\nclearance because he expected someone would interview them.  His family members do\nnot know the details of his work, although some of them are aware of his employer (Tr.\n71).\nApplicant\u2019s mother does not work outside of the home. His brother is an\naccountant in Egypt. He is married to a veterinarian and they have three children in their\nlate teens/early 20s who are students. The eldest of Applicant\u2019s three sisters is an\nadministrative assistant. She is married to a teacher and they have five children, two of\nwhom are accountants, one a doctor, and one an engineer. Their youngest is about 19\nand is a student. The middle sister is a physician married to an accountant. Their four\nchildren are all students. Applicant\u2019s youngest sister is a historian. Her spouse is an\nengineer and they have three children who are all students (Ex. 2). None of them work\nfor the Egyptian government (Tr. 69).\nApplicant does not own any real estate or hold any stocks or bonds in the U.S.\n(Tr. 64, Ex. 2). On his father\u2019s death, he inherited with his siblings a share of the family\u2019s\nhome in Egypt. Applicant does not know the value of his share (Tr. 65).\nApplicant has been an excellent worker for the defense contractor. He has taken\ninitiative on the job, at times seeking out additional responsibilities beyond the normal\nscope of his duties, and demonstrated a high level of competency. He works well with\nother members of his team (Ex. A). Applicant is willing to renounce his Egyptian\ncitizenship if required to keep his job (Answer, Tr. 99).\nAfter review of U.S. government publications concerning Egypt and its relations\nwith the U.S., I take administrative notice of the following facts:\nEgypt is an Arab republic with a fairly homogenous populace of Hamitic origin. It\nhas been a unified state for more than 5,000 years, although its independence dates\nfrom 1922. Power is vested by constitution in a strong executive. Since the assassination\nof then President Anwar el-Sadat by Islamic extremists in October 1981, Egypt has been\nled by Hosni Mubarak and the National Democratic Party. Under Mubarak, Egypt has\nreestablished its position as a leader in the Arab world, and played a moderating role in\ninternational forums such as the UN. Egypt has pursued a domestic economic reform\nprogram to expand the private sector since 1991, but it has a poor human rights record.\nA state of emergency has been in place almost continuously since 1967, but President\nMubarak has pledged to lift the law by June 2008 in a call for new comprehensive\nantiterrorism legislation. Security forces engage in arbitrary arrest, prolonged detention,\ntorture and abuse of prisoners and detainees. The government\u2019s respect for freedoms of\nthe press, association, and religion has declined, and other civil liberties (including\nInternet freedom) are restricted. Corruption and lack of transparency are persistent\nproblems.\nThe United States and Egypt enjoy strong and friendly relations based on mutual\ninterest in regional security, Middle East peace and stability, and revitalization of the\n\n7\nEgyptian economy with strong bilateral trade relations. Egypt remains a strong military\nand strategic partner of the U.S. and the U.S.-Egyptian military relationship is continually\nreinforced by Egypt\u2019s role as a contributor to various UN peacekeeping operations. U.S.\nmilitary aid to Egypt totals over $1.3 billion annually. Egypt is not known to target U.S.\nsensitive information, including economic intelligence.\nEgypt and the U.S. have a record of close cooperation on counterterrorism and\nlaw enforcement issues, and protection of U.S. persons, facilities, and interests remains\na high priority for the Egyptian government. Egypt has a policy of \u201czero tolerance\u201d toward\nextremism, and terrorists have historically been prosecuted to the full extent of the law.\nEgypt suffered a series of deadly terrorist attacks in or near tourist sites in 2004, 2005,\nand 2006. There were no successful terrorist attacks in Egypt in 2007, mainly due to the\nvigilance and effectiveness of Egypt\u2019s security services, but there is a persistent\nindigenous threat of terror activities in the Sinai.\nThe Egyptian government considers all children born to Egyptian fathers to be\nEgyptian citizens. While in Egypt, U.S. citizens of Egyptian origin may be subject to laws\nthat impose special obligations on Egyptian citizens. Male dual nationals staying in Egypt\nfor more than six months from arrival and who have not completed military service are\nnot generally required to enlist in the armed forces, but they must obtain an exemption\ncertificate before they depart Egypt. Dual U.S.-Egyptian nationals may enter and exit\nEgypt on their U.S. passports. Dual nationals who travel to Egypt on their Egyptian\npassports are normally treated as Egyptian citizens by the local government. The ability\nto provide U.S. consular assistance to those traveling on Egyptian passports is extremely\nlimited.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have\n\n8\ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere\nspeculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as\nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline B\u2014Foreign Influence\nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG & 6:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nApplicant has close relationships with his mother and siblings who are resident\ncitizens of Egypt (SOR \u00b6 1.c). He traveled to Egypt four times since March 2004 to see\nthem (SOR \u00b6 1d), and stayed with his mother while in Egypt. He has provided his mother\nfinancial support over the years, at times in preference to paying his student loan. He\n\n9\nsends her about $100 USD every two to three months currently, and he telephones her\nweekly to check on her well-being. Daughter #1 is also a resident citizen of Egypt (SOR\n\u00b6 1.b). During her entire life, she lived with Applicant for only a brief four-month period in\n2006. Yet she and Applicant have enough of a relationship for him to telephone her in\nEgypt once weekly and support her financially through voluntary payments of about $230\nUSD monthly. Despite the fact that they were twice married, from 1993 to 1997 and from\nMarch 2004 to March 2008, Applicant does not have a close relationship with former\nspouse #2 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). They lived apart during their first marriage and were together\nonly four months during their second marriage. He testified that he does not speak to his\nex-wife unless he has a reason to do so. There is a heightened risk nonetheless\nbecause she is the primary caretaker for their daughter. She has access to Applicant\u2019s\nbank account through an ATM card and withdraws monthly child support from his\naccount. AG \u00b6 7(a) (\u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that\ncontact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation,\npressure, or coercion\u201d) applies because of his bonds of affection and/or obligation to\nthese resident citizens of Egypt.\nThe government alleged separate foreign influence concerns because of\nApplicant\u2019s travel in recent years to Egypt (SOR \u00b6 1.d).  AG \u00b6 7(i) applies where there is\n\u201cconduct, especially while traveling outside the U.S., which may make the individual\nvulnerable to exploitation, pressure, or coercion by a foreign person, group, government,\nor country.\u201d There is no evidence of conduct that would implicate AG \u00b6 7(i) with the\nexception of his use of his expired Egyptian passport to prove his Egyptian birth so that\nhe would not need a visa on his U.S. passport. The security implications raised by this\nacceptance of a benefit of his foreign citizenship (not having to obtain a visa to enter\nEgypt) are more appropriately covered under Guideline C. The primary relevance of his\nforeign travel under Guideline B is that it confirms the close relationship with family\nmembers in Egypt, which is covered under AG \u00b6 7(a).\nThe government amended the SOR at the hearing to allege concerns of foreign\ninfluence raised by his part ownership of the family home in Egypt (SOR \u00b6 1.e). Applicant\ntestified that he inherited with his siblings the large family home, and he owns no\ncomparable real estate in the U.S. Yet he was unable to quantify the value of his share\nof this foreign asset. He credibly asserted a willingness to renounce his Egyptian\ncitizenship to keep his job in the U.S., so he is clearly invested financially in the U.S. Not\nenough is known about his stake in the foreign asset to conclude that it presents the\nheightened risk required for AG \u00b6 7(e) (\u201ca substantial business, financial, or property\ninterest in a foreign country, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which\ncould subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation\u201d).\nThe demonstrated strong feelings of affection for his mother, siblings, and\ndaughter living in Egypt make it difficult to satisfy mitigating condition AG \u00b6 8(a) (\u201cthe\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\n\n10\ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of\nthe U.S.\u201d). It must be noted that Egypt is a strong ally of the U.S. in the fight against\nterror, and Egypt has not been known to actively target U.S. sensitive information. To the\nextent that the risk is heightened because of terrorist activities that have occurred within\nEgypt as recently as 2004, 2005, and 2006, a distinction must be made between the risk\nto physical security that may exist and the types of concern that rise to the level of\ncompromising Applicant\u2019s ability to safeguard national security. Terrorism is not limited to\nindiscriminate acts of violence intended to incite fear. It often has political aims, and\nwhere it is allowed to operate unchecked, or is condoned, one has to question the ability\nand/or willingness of a government to protect its citizens against interference, coercion,\nor other abuses. Yet recent reports by the U.S. State Department show that while\nEgypt\u2019s northern Sinai region remained a haven for smuggling of weapons, explosives,\nfunds, and people between Egypt, Gaza, and Israel, the Egyptian government\u2019s active\nopposition to terrorism, and effective intelligence and security services, made the country\nan unattractive locale for terror groups in 2007. On the other hand, Egypt has a poor\nhuman rights record marked by arbitrary arrest and detention, pressure on the judiciary,\nand restriction of civil liberties. Nothing about his siblings\u2019 or their spouses\u2019 occupations\n(accountant, teacher, veterinarian, administrative assistant, physician, engineer)\nsuggests any security, intelligence, or military duties. Nor is there any evidence\ncontradicting Applicant\u2019s assertion that his relatives are not connected to the Egyptian\ngovernment. But they are also aware that he has applied for a security clearance and\nlittle is known about their activities and associates. The risk of heightened influence is\nnot fully mitigated where so little is known about his family members\u2019 activities and\nassociates and where Egypt has a poor human rights record.\nApplicant\u2019s vulnerability to undue foreign influence through his relatives in Egypt\nmay nonetheless be mitigated by deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in\nthe U.S. (see AG \u00b6 8(b) (\u201cthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's\nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so\nminimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in\nthe U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of\nthe U.S. interest\u201d)). Applicant asserts an \u201cultimate\u201d loyalty to the U.S., where he has\ncontinuously resided since 1987. He voluntarily acquired U.S. citizenship, and has a\nrecord of dedicated contributions to his defense contractor employer as shown by his\nperformance evaluations since 2002. He is closest to his two children who are U.S.\ncitizens and reside in the U.S. His primary concern is their welfare. The State\nDepartment reports that the Egyptian government considers all children born to Egyptian\nfathers to be Egyptian citizens, even if they were not issued an Egyptian birth certificate\nor a passport. In the event Egypt was to impose on his children, including on his\ndaughter in Egypt, an obligation of their Egyptian citizenship, I am not certain that he\ncould be counted on to resolve any conflict in favor of the U.S. without any regard to his\nchildren\u2019s interests. Furthermore, he presented an expired Egyptian passport when\nentering Egypt on all his recent trips. While he did not renew his Egyptian passport after\nit expired, his use of the expired passport to avoid having to obtain a visa on his U.S.\npassport is not reflective of a \u201cdeep and longstanding\u201d loyalty to the U.S. Based on the\ntotality of the circumstances presented, I find neither AG \u00b6 8(a) nor AG \u00b6 8(b) apply.\n\n11\nAG \u00b6 8(f) (\u201cthe value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or\nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be\nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual\u2019) could apply. He\ntestified he did not know the value of his share in the family home in Egypt. Assuming\nthe foreign property is an unlikely source of influence, manipulation, or pressure, it would\nnot be sufficient to overcome the foreign influence concerns that exist because of his\nstrong ties to his family members who are Egyptian citizens and/or residents.\nGuideline C\u2014Foreign Preference\nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign\ncountry over the U.S., then he or she may be prone to provide information or make\ndecisions that are harmful to the U.S. (AG \u00b6 9). A citizen of Egypt from birth and of the\nU.S. since February 1993, Applicant did not renew his Egyptian passport after it expired\nin December 1992. Yet on all his trips to Egypt thereafter, he presented it to border\ncontrol at the Egyptian airport to prove his birth in Egypt, which he believed was required\nto avoid obtaining a visa on his U.S. passport. Applicant\u2019s U.S. passport contains several\nstamps from Egyptian border control (Ex. 3, Ex. B) that confirm he also presented his\nU.S. passport to enter Egypt. Unbeknownst to Applicant before March 2008, his U.S.\npassport would suffice for entry without a visa since it confirms his birth in Egypt. It is not\nclear whether there was a change in Egyptian law or this was always the case. Given\nApplicant\u2019s intent in using the expired Egyptian passport was to obtain a benefit of his\nforeign citizenship (see AG \u00b6 10(a) (\u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligation of\nforeign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a\nfamily member\u201d)), it raises concerns that he could be prone to make decisions contrary\nto the interests of the U.S.\n AG \u00b6 11(a) (\u201cdual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a\nforeign country\u201d) applies in that Applicant\u2019s Egyptian citizenship is based on his birth\nthere. While the U.S. government does not encourage its citizens to remain dual\nnationals because of the complications that might ensue from obligations owed to the\nforeign country, the Department of Defense does not require the renunciation of foreign\ncitizenship to gain access. Nonetheless, there must be adequate assurances that a dual\ncitizen will not actively exercise or seek the rights, benefits, or privileges of that foreign\ncitizenship. Applicant could have renewed his Egyptian passport afer he became a\nnaturalized citizen but chose not to. His use of the expired Egyptian passport was for\npersonal convenience, rather than an act of deliberate preference for Egypt. Applicant\nsubmits that he is willing to renounce his Egyptian citizenship for his job. AG \u00b6 11(b)\n(\u201cthe individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship\u201d) applies, but it\nis entitled to less weight if it is in any way conditional. A promise to renounce is not a\nsubstitute for concrete steps taken to achieve that end. Applicant has not shown that he\nhas commenced the process of renunciation, but at his hearing, he tore pages out of his\nexpired Egyptian passport to confirm that he can be counted on to refrain from using it\nagain. He has sufficiently mitigated the foreign preference concerns.\n\n12\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nThe salient issue in the security clearance determination is not in terms of loyalty\nor allegiance, but rather what is clearly consistent with the national interest. See\nExecutive Order 10865, Section 7. An applicant may have the best of intentions and yet\nbe in an untenable position of potentially having to choose between a dear family\nmember and the interests of the U.S. Applicant maintains relationships with his mother,\nsiblings, and daughter #1, all resident citizens of his native Egypt. Egypt is a strategic\nally of the U.S., and it has little tolerance for terrorism. At the same time, it has a poor\nhuman rights record. Although Applicant has resided in the U.S. for some 20 years, he\nretains strong ties to Egypt, albeit primarily family. He is a citizen of Egypt and of the\nU.S., married and divorced his second and third wives in Egypt, and travels to Egypt to\nvisit his family members. He has significant family ties here as well, most notably his two\nchildren, but based on U.S. State Department reports, they are considered to be citizens\nof Egypt as well. Despite his favorable work record, I am unable to conclude at this time\nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to\nclassified information due to unmitigated foreign influence concerns.\n \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the\namended SOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n13\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline C:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant\u2019s parents, two siblings, and in-laws are citizens \nand residents of Taiwan. He has substantially more connections to the United States \nthan to Taiwan. In Applicant has rebutted or mitigated the government\u2019s security \nconcerns under Guideline B, Foreign Influence. Clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of Case \n \n \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his \neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order \nand DoD Directive,1 the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to \n \n \n \n1\n                                                          \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) approved by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of \nDefense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nJuly 28, 2008\n\n \n \n \n2\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on February 20, 2008, detailing security \nconcerns under Foreign Influence. \n \n \nOn March 10, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR, and requested a hearing. On \nMay 2, 2008, I was assigned the case. On May 7, 2008, DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing scheduling the hearing held on May 21, 2008. The government offered Exhibits \n(Ex.) 1 through 3, which were admitted into evidence. Applicant testified on his own \nbehalf and submitted Exhibits A through D, which were admitted into evidence. The \nrecord was kept open to allow Applicant to submit additional matters. On May 22, 2008, \nan additional document was received. There being no objection, the material was \nadmitted into evidence as Ex. E. On June 5, 2008, the transcript (Tr.) was received.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Taiwan. The request and the attached documents were not \nadmitted into evidence but were included in the record as Hearing Exhibits (HEx) I\u2500VII. \nThe facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the factual allegations in \u00b6 1.a \u2013 d of \nthe SOR supported a violation of Guideline B, Foreign Influence. \n \n \nApplicant is a 43-year-old principal systems engineer who has worked for a \ndefense contractor since May 1995, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. Co-\nworkers state Applicant is extremely trustworthy and honest, diligent, caring, intelligent, \ninnovative, dependable, hard-working, dedicated, extremely organized, mission \noriented, and a person of honor and integrity. (Ex. A) \n \n \nIn 1965, Applicant was born in Taiwan, Republic of China (ROC). In July 1989, \nApplicant married his wife who was a native of Taiwan. From August 1989 to August \n1994, he attended a U.S. state university receiving a Master of Science degree in \nAugust 1991 and his PhD. in August 1994. While obtaining his PhD, Applicant decided \nhe wished to stay permanently in the U.S. (Tr. 31) In December 2004, both Applicant \nand his wife became naturalized U.S. citizens. (Ex. 1) They have two children, ages 15 \nand 17, both born in the U.S. (Tr. 42) Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law, a U.S. citizen, lives in the \nU.S. (Tr. 43, 44)  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents, brother, and sister are citizens and residents of Taiwan, as \nare his father-in-law and mother-in-law. Applicant calls his father, who is retired school \nteacher, and his mother, a homemaker, once a month or every other month. (Tr. 26, 65) \nApplicant calls his brother and sister two or three times a year. His brother owns a \nconstruction company. His sister is a homemaker married to a marketing manager for a \nprivate company. (Tr. 27, 63) Applicant\u2019s father-in-law is a retired elementary principal \n\n \n \n \n3\nand his mother-in-law, a retired elementary school teacher. Applicant has telephone \ncontact with them once a year, usually at Chinese New Year. (Ex. 3, Tr. 28) None of his \nrelatives or in-laws have ever been affiliated with a foreign government. \n \n \nIn the past 15 years, Applicant has traveled to Taiwan twice, once in December \n1997 and again in 2007. (Tr. 28) In June 2007, Applicant spent 10 days in Taiwan \nvisiting his parents. His father was celebrating his 80th birthday. (Tr. 29) Applicant had a \nTaiwanese passport that expired in December 2004, which he returned to the \nTaiwanese authorities. (Tr. 54) Since becoming a U.S. citizen, the only passport he has \nused is his U.S. passport. (Ex 3, Ex. C) \n \n \nAll of Applicant\u2019s financial interests are in the U.S. (Tr. 16, 29) Applicant has \n$215,000 in his company\u2019s retirement saving plan, $38,000 with an investment \ncompany, and $18,000 in another fund, all in the U.S. (Ex B, 21) The assessed value of \nhis home is $167,000 on which he pays $1,000 per month. (Ex. B, Tr. 21) He has \n$8,000 in his checking account and also maintains certificates of deposit in the U.S. (Tr. \n37)  \n \n \nWhen Applicant became a U.S. citizen, he swore under oath his sole allegiance \nwas to the U.S. (Tr. 17, 81) In May 2008, Applicant applied for and was granted a \ncertificate of termination of his Taiwan citizenship. (Ex. D, Ex. E) \n \nTAIWAN \n \nTaiwan is a stable democracy with a strong and well-developed economy. (HEx. \nl, Background Note: Taiwan) Taiwan is a multi-party democracy with significant \neconomic contacts with China. (HEx. III, Taiwan: Recent Developments and U.S. Policy \nChoices) Taiwan has been a close U.S. alley for many decades and retains strong \nmutual strategic interest with the U.S. for both defense and commercial trade. The \nTaiwan Relations Act signed in 1979 states the U.S. commitment to maintain Taiwan \ndefense capability. In 2007, the U.S. announced military sales of $2.2 billion to Taiwan. \nTaiwan is known to be an active collector of U.S. economic intelligence and proprietary \ninformation. (HEx. V. Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection and \nIndustrial Espionage 2000) Although contact with Taiwan may seem to be relatively \ninnocuous, it cannot be dismissed without some degree of caution and scrutiny.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \n\n \n \n \n4\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nForeign Influence  \n \nAG & 6 expresses the security concerns regarding foreign influence: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \n\n \n \n \n5\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \n \nAG & 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual=s \nobligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual=s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents, siblings, and in-laws are citizens and residents of Taiwan. \nTwice in the last 15 years, he has visited Taiwan. In 1989, Applicant moved to the U.S., \nwhere he obtained master\u2019s degree and PhD. In 2004, he and his wife became U.S. \ncitizens. Both of his children are U.S. citizens having been born in the U.S. Applicant \nhas no foreign assets or foreign business interests, and his U.S. assets are in excess of \n$450,000. Applicant has significant ties to the U.S. and none to Taiwan other than his \nparents, brother, and sister living there. None of his relatives or their spouses have \nconnections with any foreign government. \n \nHaving considered all of the Foreign Influence disqualifying conditions, applicable \nconditions that could possibly raise a security concern are AG & 7(a) and AG & 7(b). \n \nAG & 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual=s sense of \nloyalty or obligations to the foreign person, group, government, or country \nis so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; \n \n\n \n \n \n6\n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n (f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or \nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and \ncould not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual.  \n \nIn every case where parents and siblings live overseas, there is a risk of \npressure on the relatives and through them upon the holder of a security clearance. \nUnder the facts of this case, a heightened risk for exploitation, inducement, \nmanipulation pressure, or coercion is substantiated. However, Applicant has more \nsignificant ties to the U.S. than to Taiwan. While he still has parents, two siblings, and \nin-laws living in Taiwan, he lives with wife and two children in the U.S. He has no \nfinancial or property interests in Taiwan. He owns a home in the U.S. and his ties with \nthe U.S. are much stronger than his ties with Taiwan. \n \nAG && 8(a) and 8(c) partially apply. Because of his limited contact with his \nbrother, sister, and in-laws, \u201cit is unlikely [he] will be place in a position of having to \nchoose between the interest of [his siblings and in-laws] and the interest of the U.S.\u201d His \ninfrequent contacts (once or twice a year) and a not particularly close relationship with \nthem have a very low potential for forcing him to choose between the United States and \nTaiwan. He met his burden of showing there is \u201clittle likelihood that [his relationship with \nhis brother, sister, and in-law] could create a risk of foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d \n \nEven though Applicant has limited contact with his parents having visited them in \nTaiwan only twice in the last 15 years, with the most recent visit due to his father\u2019s 80th \nbirthday, the contact is not considered casual because it is with his parents and siblings. \nHowever, there is \u201clittle likelihood that [his parents] could create a risk of foreign \ninfluence or exploitation.\u201d  \n \nAG & 8(b) fully applies. There is no evidence that his parents, siblings, or in-laws \nare or have been a political activist, challenging the policies of the Taiwanese \nGovernment. There is no evidence they currently work or ever worked for the \nTaiwanese Government, military, or news media, or that of any other foreign \ngovernment. There is no evidence that the Taiwanese Government has approached or \nthreatened Applicant or his relatives or in-laws for any reason. There is no evidence that \nhis parents, siblings, or in-laws living in Taiwan currently engage in activities which \nwould bring attention to them or that the Taiwanese government is even aware of \nApplicant\u2019s work. As such, there is a reduced possibility that his relatives, in-laws, or \nApplicant would be targets for coercion or exploitation. \n \nAG & 8(f) partially applies because he has no interest in property in Taiwan and \nhe has significant U.S. property and assets. These mitigating conditions taken together \nare sufficient to fully overcome the foreign influence security concerns.  \n \n\n \n \n \n7\nApplicant has \u201csuch deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the \nU.S., [he] can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterest.\u201d Applicant and his wife came to the U.S. in 1989 and became U.S. citizens in \n2004. Applicant attended U.S. schools to obtain his master\u2019s degree and his PhD. He \nworked for a defense contractor since 1995.  \n \nThere is little likelihood that Applicant will be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of the U.S. and a foreign entity. Likewise, because of his \nclose ties and his loyalties to the U.S. he would resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \nProtection of our national security is of paramount concern. Security clearance \ndecisions are not intended to assign guilt or to impose further punishment for past \ntransgressions. Rather, the objective of the adjudicative process is the fair-minded, \ncommonsense assessment of a person=s trustworthiness and fitness for access to \nclassified information. In reaching this decision, I have considered the whole person \nconcept in evaluating Applicant=s risk and vulnerability in protecting our national \ninterests. I considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Taiwan and the burden an \nApplicant carries when he has family members in a foreign country.  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Taiwan and the burden an \nApplicant carries when he has family members in a foreign country. Additionally, I \nconsidered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts \nand circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was born in Taiwan and almost 20 \nyears ago, he came to the U.S. to pursue his education. Applicant has returned twice in \nthe last 15 years. He has been working for the same contractor for 16 years. He is an \nestablished, highly-regarded engineer, with considerable U.S. ties and assets. His \n\n \n \n \n8\nparents and in-law are retired. His brother\u2019s and sister\u2019s jobs are not connected to any \nforeign government. Applicant is a man of integrity and trustworthiness who is loyal to \nthe U.S. He takes seriously his pledge of sole allegiance to the U.S., taken when he \nbecame a U.S. citizen.  \n \nTaiwan has been a close U.S. ally for many decades and retains strong mutual \nstrategic interests with the U.S for both defense and commercial trade. Taiwan would be \ntaking a huge risk to coerce its own citizens in an attempt to force a U.S. citizen to \ncommit espionage. It is unlikely Applicant relatives in Taiwan would be placed in a \nposition to coerce Applicant and it is also unlikely Applicant would ever be put into a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of Taiwan and the interest of the U.S.  \n \nThese facts reduce any potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress. \nApplicant was sincere, open, and honest at the hearing. In the unlikely event that his \nrelatives were subjected to coercion or duress, I find that with Applicant\u2019s deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties to the U.S., including his uncompromising \ncommitment to the U.S., his wife, and children, Applicant would resolve any attempt to \nexert pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress in favor of the U.S. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the foreign influence security concerns. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 58 and married. He is employed by a defense contractor and seeks to obtain or retain a security clearance in connection with his employment. Paragraph 1 (Guideline I, Psychological Conditions) Paragraph 2 (Guideline D, Sexual Behavior) The Government alleges in Paragraph 1 of the SOR that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has an emotional, mental or personality condition that can impair his judgment, reliability or trustworthiness. It is further alleged in Paragraph 2 that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged in sexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or emotional disorder, or reflects a lack of judgment or discretion. Applicant did not submit an answer to Paragraph 1 or its single subparagraph. His nonresponse is deemed a denial. He admits all of the allegations under Paragraph 2 in the SOR, with the exception of 2.c., which he admits as to specific dates in his Answer. Those admissions are deemed findings of fact. (Item 2.) The SOR alleges, Applicant admits, and Government exhibits substantiate, that he has been involved in questionable or illegal sexual conduct from approximately 1970 until at least 2002.

MacKinnon, Esquire, Deputy Chief Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: \nPro se\nMarch 2, 2011\n______________\nDECISION\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on August 29, 2006. (Item 6.) On March 2, 2010, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\ndetailing the security concerns under Guideline I (Psychological Conditions) and\nGuideline D (Sexual Behavior). (Item 1.) The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on March 8, 2010, and requested that\na decision be made without a hearing. (Item 2.) Department Counsel submitted a File of\nRelevant Material (FORM) to Applicant on June 30, 2010. Applicant received the FORM\non July 7, 2010, and was given 30 days to submit any additional information. Applicant\n\nApplicant admitted  soliciting prostitutes during this time period in his Answer, and not consistently up to 2002.\n1\nThe Government\u2019s FORM documents support his statement.\n2\ndid not submit any additional information. The case was assigned to me on October 14,\n2010. Based upon a review of the written record eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is 58 and married. He is employed by a defense contractor and seeks\nto obtain or retain a security clearance in connection with his employment. \nParagraph 1 (Guideline I, Psychological Conditions)\nParagraph 2 (Guideline D, Sexual Behavior)\nThe Government alleges in Paragraph 1 of the SOR that Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he has an emotional, mental or personality condition that can impair\nhis judgment, reliability or trustworthiness. It is further alleged in Paragraph 2 that\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he has engaged in sexual behavior that\ninvolves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or emotional disorder, or reflects a\nlack of judgment or discretion. \nApplicant did not submit an answer to Paragraph 1 or its single subparagraph.\nHis nonresponse is deemed a denial. He admits all of the allegations under Paragraph 2\nin the SOR, with the exception of 2.c., which he admits as to specific dates in his\nAnswer. Those admissions are deemed findings of fact. (Item 2.)\nThe SOR alleges, Applicant admits, and Government exhibits substantiate, that\nhe has been involved in questionable or illegal sexual conduct from approximately 1970\nuntil at least 2002. (Items 3, 4 and 7.)  This conduct consisted of fondling a six to nine\nyear old girl while she was sleeping, when he was eighteen years old in approximately\n1980; in 1982, forcing anal sex on a woman who was then his fianc\u00e9 against her will;\nfrom 1976 to 1980 soliciting male and female prostitutes while serving in the U.S.\nmilitary;  and in 2002, engaging in mutual public masturbation with another person in an\n1\nadult bookstore. Applicant stated that his wife knows about his solicitation of prostitutes,\nbut not of the other incidents. (Item 4 at 1.)\nIn November 2008, Applicant was examined by a Department of Defense (DoD)\npsychiatric consultant. In his report, the consultant, a board certified psychiatrist, found:\n[Applicant] did not appear to meet diagnostic criteria for a current\nmajor mental disorder, however he did meet the criteria for personality\ndisorder, not otherwise specified with schizotypal and dependant traits. He\nhas a history of paraphilia, i.e. he engaged in inappropriate sexual\nbehavior since age 18. Since these activities are of such long duration and\n\n3\nhe receives no sexual gratification from his wife, it is likely that he may\ncontinue to engage in behaviors that could be potentially risky for him.\n(Emphasis supplied.) (Item 8 at 1.)\nThe consultant goes on to say that the \u201ccondition is of a continuing nature.\u201d\nFurther, \u201cIn the future, it may cause significant defect in judgement or reliability.\u201d He also\nstated that the condition may cause a \u201csignificant defect in psychological, social or\noccupational functioning in the future.\u201d Finally, the consultant stated, \u201cThe probability of\nrecurrence is more than 30%.\u201d (Item 8 at 1-2.) Applicant chose not to respond to the\nfindings in any way.\nApplicant provided no evidence concerning the quality of his professional\nperformance, the level of responsibility his duties entail, or his track record with respect\nto handling sensitive information and observation of security procedures. He submitted\nno character references or other evidence tending to establish good judgment,\ntrustworthiness, or reliability. I was unable to evaluate his credibility, demeanor, or\ncharacter in person since he elected to have his case decided without a hearing. \nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each\nguideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are to be used as appropriate in evaluating an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.  In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his or her own common\nsense, knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the world, in making a\nreasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\n\n4\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny\ndetermination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nParagraph 1 (Guideline I, Psychological Conditions)\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Psychological Conditions is set\nout in AG & 27:      \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair\njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is\nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified\nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist)\nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government,\nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating information under this guideline. No negative inference\nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the\nbasis of seeking mental health counseling.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 28(a), \u201cbehavior that casts doubt on an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or\ntrustworthiness that is not covered under any other guideline, including but not limited to\nemotionally unstable, irresponsible, dysfunctional, violent, paranoid, or bizarre behavior\u201d\nis disqualifying. \n\n5\nSimilarly under AG & 28(b), Aan opinion by a duly qualified mental health\nprofessional that the individual has a condition not covered under any other guideline\nthat may impair judgment, reliability or trustworthiness@ may raise security concerns.\nThe evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline at \u00b6 29 also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate\nsecurity concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s psychological conditions:\n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the\nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the\ntreatment plan;\n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered into a counseling or treatment\nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is\ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a\nduly qualified mental health practitioner;\n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed\nby, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government that an\nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has a\nlow probability of recurrence or exacerbation;\n(d) the past emotional instability was a temporary condition (e.g., one\ncaused by death, illness, or marital breakup), the situation has been\nresolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of emotional\ninstability; and\n(e) there is no indication of a current problem.\nAG \u00b6 29(a), (b), (c) and (d) do not apply based on their specific terms. As for (e),\nthe Government has made a strong case that the Applicant\u2019s problem is continuing, it\nmay significantly effect his psychological, social or occupational functioning in the\nfuture, and it has an unacceptably high probability of recurrence. Applicant chose not to\npresent any evidence showing that his condition is resolved, that he is in counseling or\ntreatment, or that his problem has a low probability of recurrence. Paragraph 1 is found\nagainst the Applicant.\nParagraph 2 (Guideline D, Sexual Behavior)\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Psychological Conditions is set\nout in AG & 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a\npersonality or emotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion,\nor which may subject the individual to undue influence or coercion,\nexploitation or duress can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. No adverse\n\n6\ninference concerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely\non the basis of the sexual orientation of the individual.\nThe Government has presented more than sufficient evidence to meet its burden\nof proof. The following disqualifying conditions under \u00b6 13 are applicable based on this\nfinding:\n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has\nbeen prosecuted;\n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk sexual behavior\nthat the person is unable to stop or that may be symptomatic of a\npersonality disorder;\n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion,\nexploitation or duress;\n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion\nor judgment.\nThe Applicant\u2019s admitted conduct, consisting of fondling an underaged girl,\nengaging in coercive sexual acts, soliciting prostitutes of both sexes, and engaging in\npublic acts of masturbation, bring him within the strictures of these conditions. As\ndiscussed, the alleged conduct continued until at least 2002, but the psychiatric\nconsultant states that the probability of recurrence is unacceptably high at 30%.\nUnder the particular facts of this case, none of the mitigating conditions have\napplication. They are:\n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no\nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature;\n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under\nsuch circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or\nduress;\n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet.\nHis conduct was relatively recent, repeated, public in nature, and continues to\nserve as a bases for coercion since his wife does not know its true extent. Paragraph 2\nis found against the Applicant. \n\n7\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination\nof whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person\nconcept. The administrative judge must consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has engaged in repeated\nacts of a sexual nature which call into question his judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness. A DoD psychiatric consultant has found that his conduct may recur. His\nconduct makes him, by definition, vulnerable to coercion. Under AG \u00b6 2(a)(3),\nApplicant\u2019s conduct is recent.  Based on the state of the record, I cannot find that there\nhave been permanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6). Accordingly, at the\npresent time, I find that there is the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress (AG \u00b6 2(a)(8)); and that there is a high likelihood of recurrence (AG \u00b6 2(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his\npsychological condition and sexual behavior.\nOn balance, I conclude that Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a denial of his request for a security clearance.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline I:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\n\n8\nParagraph 2, Guideline D:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.e:\nAgainst the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Howry, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nFebruary 2, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on July 24, 2007, and July 25, 2007.  (Government Exhibits 5 and 6).  On\nAugust 19, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to\nExecutive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, (as amended) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant,\nwhich detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an\nAdministrative Judge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 29, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  The case was assigned to the undersigned\nAdministrative Judge on October 29, 2008.  A notice of hearing was issued on October\n31, 2008, scheduling the hearing for December 9, 2008.  The Government offered\neleven exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 11, which were received\nwithout objection. Applicant called two witnesses and offered six exhibits, referred to as\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A through F.  She also testified on her own behalf.  The transcript of\nthe hearing (Tr.) was received on December 17, 2008.  Based upon a review of the\ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\n\n2\n FINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 53 years old and has a high school diploma and one year of\ncollege.  She is employed by a defense contractor as an Industrial Security Specialist 3\nand is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with her employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because she is financially overextended and at risk\nof  having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.      \nThe Applicant has worked for her current employer for the past thirty-five years.\nShe has filed bankruptcy on two occasions.  The first time, on January 3, 1990, she filed\nfor Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection and discharged liabilities in excess of $32,000.00.\n(Government Exhibit 1).  To help subsidize her mother\u2019s social security check, the\nApplicant provided her with financial assistance.  At the time, her mother lived with her\nand her mother wanted to move out of the state.  So, the Applicant helped finance the\ncost of her mother\u2019s move.  The Applicant was left with all of the household expenses\nand the credit card bills.  Nine months later, her mother wanted to move back.  The\nApplicant again financially assisted her with the move.  As a result, the Applicant\nbecame severely delinquent on her bills and filed bankruptcy.    \nOn November 27, 2002, the Applicant filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy relief again.\nThis time, liabilities of over $72,000.00 were discharged.  (Government Exhibit 4).  The\nApplicant explained that her sister died and left her daughter with the mortgage.  The\nApplicant\u2019s mother wanted the Applicant to move into her sister\u2019s house to assist with\nthe mortgage and keep the house from going into foreclosure.  In July 2002, the\nApplicant moved into her sister\u2019s house with her niece.  Applicant soon learned that the\nmortgage payment was more than she had initially thought, because her sister had a\nsecond trust deed that the Applicant was not aware of.  Realizing this, the Applicant\ncould not afford her sister\u2019s house payment and the money it took to pay for her\nmother\u2019s rent in the retirement home.  Applicant\u2019s niece was laid off of her job and so\nshe was unable to pay her part of the mortgage.  The Applicant volunteered to work\novertime but still could not afford her expenses.         \nSince 2002, the Applicant has demonstrated financial responsibility.  She is\ncurrent with all of her monthly expenses and she has no delinquent debts.  (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit F and Government Exhibit 10).\n\n3\nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because she intentionally falsified material aspects\nof her personal background during the clearance screening process.\nWhile working for her current employer, the Applicant received counseling in July\n1996, for her second offense of failure to place regular ledger accounting on her\ntimecard.  She explained that she left work for the day and forgot to fill out her time\ncard.  She admits that this occurred but claims that this was an oversight on her part.  A\nletter was also placed in her personnel file by her manger.  (Government Exhibit 8).\nBased upon an anonymous report made to the company hot line, the Applicant\nwas investigated for improperly recording her time card.  (Government Exhibit 8).\nApplicant explained that she was accused of leaving work early and not always working\neight hours when her time card reflected that she had.  The Applicant denies the\nmisconduct.  She explained that she did not always swipe out her badge every time she\nleft her office.  Sometimes, if others went to the door and swiped their badge, if the\nApplicant knew them, she would \u201ctailgate\u201d or enter behind them without swiping her\nbadge.  This procedure was permitted by the company.  She entered and exited in this\nfashion and her badge did not always reflect the hours she actually worked.  Applicant\u2019s\nmanager, who thinks highly of her, testified that when he learned about the situation, he\nwas puzzled because the records showed that sometimes there was no record of the\nApplicant even logging in for the day, or that she had logged off early.  (Tr. p. 81).  He\nexplained that the Applicant told him that she had been taking care of sick and elderly\nmother.  She would take lunch early and then return to work late and make up the\nhours.  Her mother passed away earlier this year. \nApplicant contends that she has always worked a full eight hour day, although\nshe is unable to prove it.  Applicant was given a memorandum of corrective action and a\nfive days suspension by her manager.    \nApplicant\u2019s manager testified that since the above described incident, there was\nanother case with similar circumstances that was investigated by the company and the\ncharges were dropped against the employee.  In light of this case, the Applicant\u2019s\nmanager plans on meeting with the manager of human resources and asking for a\nreview of the Applicant\u2019s case.  He considers the Applicant to be honest, responsible\nand trustworthy, and highly recommends her for a position of trust.\nApplicant\u2019s Facility Security Officer, who is also the Applicant\u2019s direct supervisor,\ntestified that the Applicant serves as her right arm.  The Applicant takes on the\nleadership role in the organization in terms of directing policy and procedure, providing\nguidance and instruction to employees and coworkers concerning security matters.  She\nis responsible for many facets of security education at her facility. She provides security\nbriefings as well as managing classification issues.  Her work is considered to be of\nexcellent quality, as she is very knowledgeable, timely, independent, multi-faceted and\nconsidered one of the best classification management specialist at the company.\nApplicant\u2019s supervisor further testified that the Applicant was encouraged to take flex\n\n4\ntime during the period she was taking care of her sick mother.  (Tr. p. 103).  She states\nthat the Applicant always left messages if she needed to leave early to take her mother\nto the doctor, or if she was going to be late because she needed to pick up her mother\u2019s\nprescriptions.  (Tr. p. 104).  Concerning the anonymous report accusing the Applicant of\ntime card misconduct, the Applicant\u2019s supervisor testified that she was \u201ccaught off\nguard\u201d.  She was never contacted concerning the investigation and was thus, unable to\ngive her input.  (Tr.  p. 105).  \nIn October 2004, the Applicant was called in for an interview with an investigator\nfrom her company who had ran a random credit card report that revealed that the\nApplicant had been using her company credit card for personal matters which was\nprohibited by the company.  From January 2002 through March 2004, her employer\naccused her of taking cash advances on her company credit card during an eighteen\nmonth period.  The Applicant admitted the violation, but argued that although she\nobtained the cash advances with her company credit card, she always paid the bill in full\nwhen the statement came in the very next month.  She did not have any credit cards of\nher own because of her bad credit.  Applicant was terminated in January 2005 for\nviolating company policy.  The Applicant obtained counsel and she was ultimately\nreinstated in November 2005.  Her punishment was five days off without pay and the\nother time was considered an unpaid leave of absence.      \nIn October 1987, the Applicant was arrested and charged with Petty Theft.  She\nexplained that during her lunch hour she went to a department store, purchased some\npanty hose and then put a two piece outfit into her bag without paying for it.  As she was\nleaving the store, she was caught by security.  She was found guilty, fined $570.00 and\nplaced on three years probation.  (Government Exhibit 7).  \nPerformance Reviews of the Applicant for 2004, 2006 and 2007, reflect that she\n\u201cmet expectations\u201d or \u201cexceeded expectations\u201d in every category.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\nA).  The Applicant received an award from her exceptional performance on the job.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B).  Letters of recommendation from the two individuals in company\nSenior Management that testified reflect that they consider the Applicant to be honest,\ntrustworthy and responsible.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits C and D).   \nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\n\n5\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n19.(c) a history of not meeting financial obligation; \n19.(e) consistent spending beyond ones means, which may be indicated by\nexcessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio,\nand/or other financial analysis. \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n20.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances;\n20.(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or\nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\n20.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n16.(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other\nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which,\nwhen combined with all available information supports a whole-person assessment of\nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness\ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person\nmay not properly safeguard protected information.  This includes but is not limited to\nconsideration of: (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and (4) evidence of\nsignificant misuse of Government or other employer\u2019s time or resources.\n\n6\nCondition that could mitigate security concerns:\n17.(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to\nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors,\ncircumstances, or facts that caused untrustworthiness, unreliable, or other\ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n a.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\n     b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\n\n7\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in instances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates\npoor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F) and that she has\ndemonstrated questionable judgment (Guideline E).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with her security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case.  The Applicant filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in 1990 and again in\n2002.  Now, she is no longer taking care of two households that included her mother\u2019s\nand hers.  Her mother has passed away and she is only financially responsible for\nherself.  She is current with all of her monthly expenses and has been paying her debts\nin a timely fashion.  She has learned to live within her means.  She is planning for her\nretirement and trying to save money to do so.  She understands the importance of\npaying her bills on time.  Under the circumstances, she has made a good faith effort to\nresolve her indebtedness, and there is evidence of financial rehabilitation.  The\nApplicant has demonstrated that she can properly handle her financial affairs.\nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19.(a)\ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; 19.(c) a history of not meeting financial\nobligation; and 19.(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated\nby excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio,\nand/or other financial analysis apply.  However, Mitigating Conditions 20.(b) the\n\n8\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances; 20.(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for\nthe problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control and 20.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts also apply.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant\nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations).    \nThe evidence concerning the accusations against the Applicant for improper\ncompany time card reporting is weak at best.  Her supervisor and manager gave her\napproval to work flex hours and she did so.  Why the investigators did not contact her\nleadership regarding the matter is suspect.  Applicant\u2019s explanation is understandable\nand reasonable under the circumstances.  With respect to the improper use of the\ncompany credit card, the failure to place regular ledger accounting on her timecard, and\nher arrest for petty theft that occurred twenty-one years ago, the Applicant admits that\nshe was wrong and that she has learned from her embarrassing and shameful\nmistakes.  Based upon all of the evidence, including the favorable recommendations\nand the sincerity and honesty of her testimony, I find that she is sufficiently trustworthy\nto have access to classified information. \nUnder Personal Conduct, Guideline E, Disqualifying Condition 16.(d) credible\nadverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not\nbe sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all\navailable information supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly\nsafeguard protected information.  This includes but is not limited to consideration of: (3)\na pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and (4) evidence of significant misuse of\nGovernment or other employer\u2019s time or resources applies.  However, Mitigating\nCondition 17.(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors,\ncircumstances, or facts that caused untrustworthiness, unreliable, or other\ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur also applies.  Accordingly,\nGuideline E is found for the Applicant.   \n \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of good judgement, trustworthiness, reliability, candor, a\nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and/or other characteristics indicating\nthat the person may properly safeguard classified information.\n  \nI have considered all of the evidence presented and it sufficiently mitigates the\nadverse information brought against her.  On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant\nhas overcome the Government's case opposing her request for a security clearance.\n\n9\nAccordingly, the evidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and\nconclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the SOR.    \n     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: \nFor the Applicant.\n    \n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n   \nParagraph 2: \nFor the Applicant.\n    \n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n   \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

These allegations are not at\n1\nissue in this appeal.  \nThe total amount of the debts forming the basis of the Judge\u2019s adverse findings under Guideline F exceeds\n2\n$34,000.00. \nThe SOR alleged six falsifications contained in SCAs executed in 2004 and in 2008.  These concerned the\n3\nexistence of tax liens, unpaid judgements, debts delinquent more than 180 days, and debts delinquent more than 90 days.\nApplicant denied each of these allegations and the Judge found against him on each one.    \nSee Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E2.17(c)and 20(b). \n4\n2\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as\namended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing.  On December 17, 2008, after the hearing,\nAdministrative Judge Rita C. O\u2019Brien denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant\nfiled a timely appeal pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s application of the\nGuideline F and E mitigating conditions was erroneous and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse security\nclearance decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.   Finding no error, we affirm.\n1\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact: Applicant is 42 years old.  He\nserved in the U.S. Navy from 1985 to 2006, retiring as a Chief Petty Officer.  He is a security\nmanager for a defense contractor.\nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts, for such things as car loans, credit card accounts,\nconsumer purchases, etc.  The Judge noted that, while Applicant denied that he owed them, claiming\nthey had been previously paid off or challenging their legitimacy, he provided no documentation in\ncorroboration.

She also noted the multiple nature of the false statements and the relative\n4\nrecency of at least two of them.  In light of the record as a whole, the Judge has drawn a rational\nconnection between the facts found and her ultimate adverse security clearance decision, both as\nregards the mitigating conditions and the whole-person factors.

While in the Navy, Applicant worked as a security\nmanager. He was awarded Sailor of the Month, Sailor of the Quarter, and Sailor of the Year\n\n3\n(Tr. 22). Since retiring, he has worked for the same defense contractor, where he is a\nSecurity Manager for one of the company\u2019s branches. He also performs Human Resources\nfunctions. According to his income tax returns, Applicant\u2019s income has risen from a 1999\ngross income of $22,000 to a 2007 gross income (salary and pension) of $95,761 (AE E).\nIn mid-2007, his monthly net remainder was $1,149 (GE 3).\nThe Statement of Reasons alleges the following 18 debts, totaling approximately\n$49,000.\n\u2022\n1.a. (car loan, $8,094) - Applicant returned a faulty car to the dealer; loan company\nfiled judgment while Applicant was stationed overseas. He understands he is legally\nresponsible to pay under the purchase contract (GE 3). He made a few payments\nto the dealer\u2019s attorney and was told that was sufficient. He has no documentation\nand no intent to pay the outstanding judgment (GE 13; AE B; Tr 50-55).\n\u2022\n1.b. (car loan, $421) - denies because debt was dismissed based on a class action\nsuit; no documentation (GE 13; Tr. 56-58).\n\u2022\n1.c. (furniture purchase, $2,677) - after a dispute, Applicant returned goods to\ncompany, which filed a judgment. Applicant was unaware of judgment until he\nreceived SOR. Contacted company and was told it has no record of debt; no\ndocumentation of contact. He believes the account is closed because it is 12 years\nold (Tr. 58-61).\n\u2022\n1.d. (loan, $7,069) - denies because he believes the loan, which he co-signed with\nhis father, has been paid; no documentation (Tr 61-65).\n\u2022\n1.e. ($1,023), 1.i. ($967) and 1.r. ($941) (credit card accounts from same\ncreditor) - denies because his wife paid a settlement of $595. Based on two different\naccount numbers in the credit reports, Government contends there are two accounts.\nOn one account, Capital One sued his wife for $1,219, and she settled the debt for\n$595; on the other account, Capital One sued Applicant, and that debt of $1,302\nremains unpaid (GE 7, 8 and 9; AE C and D; Tr 65-78).\n\u2022\n1.f. (telephone, $723) - disputes because he does not recognize debt.  Applicant\nstates that the company is no longer in business (Tr. 34; 78-79).\n\u2022\n1.g. IRS tax lien (tax years 1992 - 1996, $13,061) - denies because debt has been\npaid by allotment from his salary since the mid-1990s. Applicant believed he was not\nrequired to file income tax returns while stationed overseas in the mid-90s. Upon\nfiling when he returned to the United States, he owed approximately $13,000 (AE E\nand G; Tr 79-95).\n\n4\n\u2022\n1.h. (cable, $209) - denies charge for cable box because he returned it; no\ndocumentation (Tr 95-98).\n\u2022\n1.i. credit card ($967) - see 1.e., above.\n\u2022\n1.j. (credit card, $893) - denies because he paid it. In his Interrogatory of November\n2007, Applicant stated it is his wife\u2019s account. In his subject interview, he stated that\nhe settled this account through a collection agency for $499. However, the\nInterrogatory document showing a $499 settlement relates to another collection\nagency, and other creditors, with no mention of the creditor in allegation 1.j. (GE 3,\n4 and 7; Tr 98-100).\n\u2022\n1.k. (car loan, $5,112) - denies because he paid the debt in 2007. He contacted the\ncompany verbally but has no documentation. Based on two different accounts\nnumbers for this creditor in the credit reports, Government contends there are two\naccounts \u2013 one for a car purchased in 1999 for $10,000, which has been paid off,\nand a second account for a car purchased in 2001 for $16,000, which has a\ndelinquent balance of $5,000. Applicant denies having two car loans with this creditor\n(GE 7; AE J; Tr 100-103). \n\u2022\n1.l. (car loan, $1,075) - denies that he was 90 days delinquent (GE 9; Tr 108-109).\n\u2022\n1.m. (child support, $400) - denies because court-ordered payments have been\ndeducted from his salary since 1991 (AE F, H and I; GE 9; Tr 109).\n\u2022\n1.n. (loan, $3,709) - denies because he paid it in 1998; no documentation (GE 10;\nAE J; Tr 111-115).\n\u2022\n1.o. (college tuition, $4,167) - denies because payment should have been made\nfrom a Navy scholarship (AE A; Tr 115-116).\n\u2022\n1.p. (timeshare, $2,231) - denies because he sold timeshare back to company; no\ndocumentation (Tr 116-118).\n\u2022\n1.q. (citation for speeding, $100) - denies because he paid online in June 2008;\nno documentation (Tr 118-119).\n\u2022\n1.r. (credit card, $941) - see 1.e., above.\nApplicant denies owing the eighteen debts alleged in the SOR. As to four of the\ndebts, I find the following: Applicant paid the IRS tax lien alleged at 1.g., related to due tax\nyears 1992 through 1996 (AE G); he was never 90 days past due on his payments on the\ncar loan alleged at allegation 1.l. (GE 7, 8 and 9; AE J); based on his record of consistent\nmonthly payments automatically deducted from his salary, he was not one month past due\n\nDirective. 6.3.\n5 \n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n6\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n7\n5\nin child support as alleged at 1.m. (AE F, H and I); and Applicant was not responsible for\nthe tuition debt alleged at 1.o., which was to be paid with a Petty Officer Scholarship he was\nawarded; the account was sent for collection by error (GE 3; AE A). \nI also find that, without documentation, Applicant failed to support his claim that he\npaid or does not owe the debts alleged at 1.a., through 1.f, 1.h. through 1.k., 1.n., and 1.p.\nthrough 1.r. \nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, and\nconsideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the  \u201cwhole person\u201d factors\n5\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the Guidelines.\nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an Applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified information.\nIn this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties require\nconsideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under Guideline\nF (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct).  \nA security clearance decision is intended only to resolve the question of whether it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest  for an Applicant to either receive or continue\n6\nto have access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an Applicant. Additionally, the government must be able to\nprove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it then\nfalls to the Applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no\none has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an Applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.7\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with\nthe government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability\nand trustworthiness to protect the national interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt\n\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n8\n6\nabout an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.8\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nAG \u00b618 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations:\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-extended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. Compulsive\ngambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including espionage.\nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern. It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\nThe facts presented support application of two disqualifying conditions. AG \u00b619(a)\n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) applies. Although Applicant earns a substantial\nsalary, supplemented by his military pension, he has allowed delinquencies to accrue to\nthe point where he carries a significant debt load. Despite a $20,000 increase in salary in\n2006, and an additional $30,000 increase in 2007, Applicant allowed numerous judgments\nand delinquencies to remain unresolved. AG \u00b619(c) (a history of not meeting financial\nobligations) also applies because many of Applicant\u2019s debts, which started becoming\ndelinquent around the mid-1990s, still appear in his 2007 and 2008 credit bureau reports.\nAG \u00b619(g) (failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as\nrequired or the fraudulent filing of the same) also applies because Applicant did not timely\nfile his federal tax returns. His 1992 - 1996 returns were filed when he returned from\noverseas duty, and resulted in the $13,000 tax lien alleged at 1.g. Applicant also failed to\nfile other returns timely. His 1999 and 2000 returns were filed in 2001; his 2001 and 2002\nreturns were filed in 2004, and his 2004, 2005 and 2006 returns were filed in July 2007 (AE\nE). \nThe financial considerations guideline also includes factors that can mitigate\ndisqualifying conditions. Five mitigating conditions are relevant to the facts: \nAG \u00b620(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n\n7\nAG \u00b620(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person's control [e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation], and the individual acted responsibly under\nthe circumstances; \nAG \u00b620(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control;\nAG \u00b620(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts; and\nAG \u00b620(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to\nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue;\nApplicant\u2019s debts are both numerous and recent. Although some became\ndelinquent in the 1990s, delinquencies continued to accrue in the 2000's and many still\nappear on his 2007 and 2008 credit bureau reports. AG \u00b620(a) does not apply.\nThe key element in mitigating condition AG \u00b620(b) is that the factors that caused\nthe financial problems were beyond the Applicant\u2019s control. Nothing in the evidence or\ntestimony indicates that factors such as unemployment, divorce or other unforeseen\nevents interfered with Applicant\u2019s ability to pay his debts. Mitigating condition AG \u00b620(b)\ncannot be applied.\nAlthough Applicant contends that his debts are paid, he could support that\ncontention only as to four of his debts. He provided no documentation to show that eight\nother debts have been paid. Without documentation to support his contention, I cannot\nconclude that Applicant either resolved these debts or made a good-faith effort to do so,\nand neither AG 20 \u00b6(c) nor AG \u00b620(d) can be applied. Finally, AG 20(e) also does not\napply. Although Applicant claims that he does not recognize the debt to C&P Telephone,\nthere is no evidence that he has taken action to notify the credit bureau report to rectify\nhis credit report. I resolve Guideline F against Applicant.\nPersonal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern about personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations\ncan raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness\nand ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is\nany failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the\n\n ISCR Case No.02-23073 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar 20, 2004).\n9\n8\nsecurity clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with\nthe security clearance process.\nThe government alleges that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose his financial\ndelinquencies, implicating AG \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification\nof relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement,\nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications,\naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or\naward fiduciary responsibilities). Applicant failed to report any financial issues on either\nhis 2004 or his 2008 Security Clearance Application. Even though his IRS tax lien was not\nreleased until 2007, and was delinquent at the time he filled out his Security Clearance\nApplication in 2004, he answered \u201cNo\u201d to question 36. Similarly, as shown in Applicant\u2019s\ncredit bureau reports, he had numerous debts that had been six months past due during\nthe seven years before he completed  the applications both in 2004 and in 2008. Applicant\nhad a long history of financial problems and, at the time he completed his Security\nClearance Applications in 2004 and in 2008, he still had not resolved them. Yet he\nsubmitted \u201cclean\u201d applications, giving the government no indication that finances were an\nissue to be investigated further. \nAs to mitigation, AG \u00b6\u00b617(a) and 17(c) are relevant. There is no evidence that\nApplicant informed any authorized government official that he wished to correct the\nanswers on his applications. Although he discussed his debts with the investigator during\nhis interviews, the Appeal Board has held that subsequent honesty at an interview does\nnot negate the security implications of initial dishonesty on security clearance\napplications.  AG \u00b617(a) cannot be applied. Neither is AG \u00b617(c) applicable (the offense\n9\nis so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened\nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on\nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment). Applicant\u2019s conduct cannot\nbe considered minor because he failed to be forthright with the government not once, but\non two separate occasions during a security clearance investigation. In addition, Applicant\nsubmitted his latest security clearance application less than one year ago, making his\nconduct recent. I resolve Guideline E against Applicant.\nWhole Person Analysis  \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate the\nApplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and all\nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process\nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\n\n9\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8)\nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires that the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance\nmust be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the\nguidelines and the whole person concept. Under each guideline, I considered the\npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances\nsurrounding this case. \nAt the time these debts were incurred, Applicant was a mature and experienced\nadult. In addition, the questions on his security clearance application in 2004, the\ndiscussion of finances during his 2007 interview, and his own knowledge as a personnel\nsecurity officer should have impelled him to resolve his debts and rectify his credit report.\nYet numerous debts remain with no documented effort by Applicant. Based on his lack\nof effort, and his past history of debt accumulation, I cannot confidently predict he will not\ncontinue to have financial difficulties and demonstrate lack of reliability and good\njudgment.\nWhen he completed security clearance applications in 2004 and 2008, Applicant\nfailed to inform the government of his true financial situation. As Applicant worked as a\nsecurity officer both in the military and in his civilian position, he had or should have had\nan even greater awareness than the average Applicant of the critical need for truthfulness\nin the security clearance process. Nevertheless, he failed to inform the government of his\nfinancial problems, not only in 2004, but again in 2008. The government cannot place its\nconfidence in those who do not demonstrate the highest level of trustworthiness and\nreliability.\nOverall, the record evidence fails to satisfy the doubts raised about Applicant\u2019s\nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not\nmitigated the security concerns arising from the cited adjudicative guidelines.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1, Guideline F\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n10\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to allow Applicant access to\nclassified information.

Access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn June 19, 2005, Applicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (EPSQ \n86) (GE 1).1 On March 21, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him,2 pursuant to Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, 1960, as \n \n1There is no allegation of falsification of Applicant\u2019s EPSQ 86.   \n \n2Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated March 21. 2008, is the source for the facts in the remainder \nof this paragraph unless stated otherwise (Government Exhibit (GE) 4). \nSeptember 25, 2008\n\n \n2 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \namended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended and modified.3 The SOR alleges security concerns under Guideline \nB (Foreign Influence). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the \npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended \nreferral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn April 14, 2008, Applicant provided a response to the SOR allegations, and \nelected to have his case decided at a hearing (Government Exhibit (GE) 5). On April 30, \n2008, Department Counsel indicated he was ready to proceed. On May 5, 2008, the \ncase was assigned to an Administrative Judge. On May 21, 2008, the case was \nreassigned to another Administrative Judge. On June 24, 2008, Applicant\u2019s counsel \nrequested a delay in Applicant\u2019s hearing. On August 6, 2008, the case was transferred \nto me. \n \nThe notices of hearing were issued on June 5, 6, and July 24, 2008 (GE 3). \nApplicant\u2019s hearing was held on September 10, 2008. I admitted GE 1 and 2 and \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A to J without objection (Transcript (Tr.) 17, 19-22, 29-32, 47, \n59-60). I received the transcript on September 19, 2008. \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nAdministrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel asked me to take administrative notice concerning materials \nrelated to the Russian Federation (Russia). Department Counsel did not object to my \ndecision to take administrative notice of the facts in the 8-page document entitled \nAdministrative Notice, dated September 4, 2008 (GE 6) (Tr. 9-10).  Applicant\u2019s Counsel \nrequested Administrative notice of facts in addition to the GE 6 (Tr. 10-11; AE M, N). \nDepartment Counsel did not object to my administrative notice of the facts in AE N (AE \nM). I took administrative notice of the facts in GE 6 and AE N as indicated in the \nRussian Federation portion of the Statement of Facts section of this decision.  \n \nIn support of the requested administrative notice of facts concerning Russia, \nsupporting documents show detail and context for those facts (Ex. I to VIII\u2014listed in \nRequest for Administrative Notice at 7-8). Administrative or official notice is the \nappropriate type of notice used for administrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-\n11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. \n12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. \n \n3On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines (AGs) are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case because his SOR was issued \nafter Sep. 1, 2006. \n\n \n3 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nImmigration and Naturalization  Service, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most \ncommon basis for administrative notice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are \neither well known or from government reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section \n25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types of facts for administrative notice). \nExhibits I to VIII are attached to GE 6 to ensure the administrative record is complete.  \n \nSOR Amendment \n \n \nAt his hearing, Applicant disclosed that he used his Russian passport to travel to \nRussia in 1997 (Tr. 62). On April 23, 2002, his Russian passport expired (Tr. 63, AE L). \nHis passport was in storage about a 6-hour drive from his residence (Tr. 63). At \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s request and without objection, I granted the motion to amend the \nSOR to include an allegation concerning Applicant\u2019s continued possession of an expired \nRussian passport under Guideline C (Tr. 76-79). Guideline C is designated paragraph 2 \nand Applicant\u2019s continued possession of an expired Russian passport is designated \nsubparagraph 2a.  \n \nFindings of Fact4 \n \nAs to the SOR\u2019s factual allegations, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a to 1.c in his response to the SOR. His admissions are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make \nthe following findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is 57 years old (Tr. 23). He was born in the Union of Soviet Socialist \nRepublics (USSR) (hereinafter referred to as Russia) (Tr. 23). He is not currently \nmarried (Tr. 40). He lives alone (Tr. 69). His wife passed away from cancer 11 years \nago (Tr. 40). She is buried in the United States (Tr. 40). Applicant purchased a burial \nplot for himself in the same cemetery where his wife is buried (Tr. 41). He owns a home \nnearby valued at about $200,000 (Tr. 41, 45). He rents his home to tenants because he \nwas transferred, but he plans to eventually return to living in it (Tr. 45). He currently lives \nin an apartment (Tr. 44). Applicant also owns a timeshare in another U.S. state (Tr. 45). \nHe has a 401K plan with a U.S. contractor valued at about $60,000 (Tr. 45).  \n \nApplicant attended school in Russia up to the Ph.D degree level in science (Tr. \n24). He never served in the Russian military (Tr. 24). He was exempt from military \nservice because of his eyes (Tr. 24). Applicant has never held a Russian security \nclearance or worked on classified projects (Tr. 80). In 1992, he left Russia and went to \nGermany (Tr. 24). In 1993, he immigrated to the United States to begin employment at \nNASA (Tr. 25). In 1994, a U.S. national laboratory wrote the U.S. Immigration and \nNaturalization Service, and asked that Applicant receive special immigration \nconsideration because \u201che is an accomplished scientist of international stature\u201d (AE E). \nThis letter suggested he could make significant contributions to NASA and the \nDepartment of Defense (AE E). Another 1994 letter from an American physicist \ndescribed Applicant\u2019s character, dedication, and desire to support U.S. scientific \n \n4 The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment or locations in order to protect \nApplicant and his family\u2019s privacy. The cited sources contain more specific information.  \n\n \n4 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nendeavors (AE F). Applicant subsequently obtained a green card as a person with \nexceptional ability in science (Tr. 25). He became a U.S. citizen in 2001 as soon as he \nwas eligible (Tr. 33). Eventually, Applicant gravitated to working as a senior assistant \nanalyst/programmer in the information technology area (Tr. 35, 39). He began \nemployment for the current defense contractor on February 1, 2005 (Tr. 38). The only \ntime he or his son returned to Russia was in 1997 to attend a conference, which was \nfunded by NASA (Tr. 48, 73). He used his Russian passport to enter Russia in 1997 (Tr. \n62). He brought his son with him when he went to Russia (Tr. 73). Applicant has not \nvoted in any Russian elections (Tr. 49, 60-61). He has not been contacted by any \nRussian companies or state representatives since immigrating to the United States (Tr. \n49). He has never committed a security violation (Tr. 40). He is loyal to the United \nStates (Tr. 49). If he were contacted and asked to reveal classified information, he \nwould report the contact to U.S. law enforcement authorities (Tr. 50, 65). If it was a \nserious matter, he would call the FBI (Tr. 65). He has received training from contractors \non what to do if contacted for classified information (Tr. 65). \n \nAlthough Applicant had a Russian passport, he traveled using his U.S. State \nDepartment travel document and then his U.S. passport (Tr. 34). Aside from his trip to \nRussia in 1997, his only other travel outside the United States was to India (Tr. 64). He \nused his U.S. passport to travel to India on NASA business (Tr. 34). His Russian \npassport expired on April 23, 2002 (AE L). On September 15, 2008, Applicant\u2019s security \noffice destroyed his expired Russian passport (AE L). He does not intend to return to \nRussia (Tr. 71). When interviewed by an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \ninvestigator, he offered to renounce his Russian citizenship (Tr. 81). He has not actually \nrenounced Russian citizenship because he did not see how he could claim Russian \ncitizenship without proper documentation (Tr. 71-72).  At his hearing, he reiterated that if \nnecessary, he would formally renounce his Russian citizenship (Tr. 75).5 \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother passed away in 2007 (Tr. 79). Applicant\u2019s sister (SA) is a \ncitizen and resident of Russia (SOR \u00b6 1.a, Tr. 50-51). SA is 60 years old, holds a PhD in \nchemistry and works at a government-related institute (Tr. 51). The institute provides \nscientific support based on contracts, and has performed work for the United States (Tr. \n52). The institute belongs to or is owned by the Russian government (Tr. 52). SA is best \ndescribed as a contractor doing projects for non-Russian as well as Russian entities (Tr. \n66). The institute\u2019s applications are industrial (Tr. 79). Applicant described the frequency \nof his communications with SA as about once or twice a month (Tr. 69-70) and the \ncontent of his communications with his sister as follows (Tr. 55): \n \nHolidays, birthdays, if there are any house concerns, you know. And then \nmy sister, she likes to brag about, you know, her garden, you know, her \ncountry house. Yes, she likes, she has all kind of questions, you know, \nwhat should I do? Should I paint it or should I \u2013you know, all that. \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 03-04300 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2006) describes a protracted process for \nrevocation of Russian citizenship, and states, \u201cAccording to Russian Federation Law, Applicant's \ncitizenship will be \u2018irrevocably annulled by the decision of the presidential committee\u2019 which takes up to \nsix months.\u201d The rules for Russian citizenship revocation may be different now than when ISCR Case No. \n03-04300 was heard in 2004 or 2005. \n\n \n5 \n                                                                                                                                             \n \nThey also discuss Applicant\u2019s son and health issues (Tr. 56). SA has visited Applicant \nand his son four times in the United States since 1993 (Tr. 56, 66). SA most recently \nvisited the United States in May 2008 (Tr. 65). SA will probably not emigrate to the \nUnited States because she lacks English language skills (Tr. 71). SA is aware Applicant \nworks with computers and is a system administrator (Tr. 56). Applicant does not discuss \nwork projects with SA or SA\u2019s common-law husband (SH) (Tr. 57). SA and SH are not \nreally aware of what is involved in being a system administrator (Tr. 56). \n \nSH is a citizen and resident of Russia (SOR \u00b6 1.b, Tr. 50-51). SH is 70 years old \nand employed at the same government-related institute as SA (Tr. 51). SA and SH are \nsemi-retired (Tr. 53). SA and SH receive an old-age type pension similar to U.S. social \nsecurity (Tr. 53). SA and SH have worked at the same place for many years (Tr. 53). \nTheir friends and social network are work-oriented, and they did not want to totally cut \ntheir ties with the institute (Tr. 53). Applicant does not send funds to SA or SH (Tr. 54).  \nSA and SH do not hold Russian security clearances (Tr. 79).  \n \nApplicant maintains contact with a former classmate (CM) and CM\u2019s wife. They \nboth work at Russian facilities connected to the Russian government (SOR \u00b6 1.c). He \nhas been a friend of CM since Applicant and CM were 14 or 15 years old (Tr. 57). \nUsually he spoke to CM \u201calmost every New Year\u201d (Tr. 57). His last communication with \nCM was around New Years 2006 (Tr. 58, 73-74). When they did communicate, the \nconversation focused on their children (Tr. 58). CM knows Applicant is a systems \nadministrator, but CM is unaware of details about Applicant\u2019s employer (Tr. 58-59).    \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant may receive a pension from Russia based on the 15 \nyears he was employed in Russia (SOR 1.d).  Applicant explained he was not aware of \nany such pension (Tr. 67). He has never checked on whether a pension was available \n(Tr. 67). He has no property and no stocks or investments in Russia (Tr. 68). \n \nApplicant\u2019s most important family connection to the United States is his son (SN), \nwho is 26 years old (Tr. 41). SN was 10 when he moved to the United States (Tr. 41). \nSN is a U.S. citizen (Tr. 41). SN last lived with Applicant in 2002 (Tr. 74-75). SN can \nspeak a little Russian, but SN\u2019s English is much better than his Russian language skills \n(Tr. 42). SN has a masters degree, works for a U.S. state government, and is financially \nindependent from Applicant (Tr. 42, 55). SN married a woman from Ukraine (SU), but \nthey do not have any children (Tr. 43, 74). SU has a green card, and has lived in the \nUnited States for three years (Tr. 74). Applicant is very close to SN and he frequently \nvisits SN and SU (Tr. 43-44). Applicant has other more distant relatives who are U.S. \ncitizens and live in the United States, with whom he maintains contact (Tr. 46-48, 61).  \n  \nRecommendations and Work Performance \n \n \nThe government employee who supervises the contractor\u2019s performance (MA) \nand Applicant\u2019s direct supervisor (SD) made statements on Applicant\u2019s behalf at his \nhearing (Tr. 84-96). MA and SD have known Applicant since he came to work for the \ncontractor in February 2005 (Tr. 87). MA had daily contact with Applicant for the first two \n\n \n6 \n                                                                                                                                             \nyears and then weekly contact after 2007. Applicant and MA were required by Base \nClosure and Realignment requirements to work at different locations after 2007 (Tr. 88). \nSD has daily contact with Applicant (Tr. 105). Applicant is entrusted with millions of \ndollars of contractor and government equipment. MA and SD described Applicant as \ntrustworthy, conscientious and responsible about compliance with security requirements \n(Tr. 88-90, 94-95, 106, 108). Applicant is diligent and meticulous in his work \nperformance (Tr. 88-91, 106). Applicant is a \u201ctop notch\u201d employee (Tr. 91). MA believes \nApplicant prefers living in the United States as opposed to Russia (Tr. 93).  SD \nindicated Applicant criticized Russia for its recent invasion of Georgia (Tr. 107).  \nApplicant prefers the political stability of the United States (Tr. 108).  \n \n \nAn affidavit from a senior systems analyst, who has known Applicant since 2005, \ndescribes him as \u201can outstanding employee, dedicated, loyal, on-time, seldom takes \nleave, very good about getting the job done, and easy to manage. In fact, I cannot say \nenough good things to describe [his] character and performance\u201d (AE J at 1).  He also \nemphasized Applicant\u2019s careful, diligent and conscientious handling of sensitive and \nclassified materials and devices (AE J at 1). He recommended Applicant receive a \nclearance because of his confidence that Applicant is a trustworthy person (AE J at 2).   \n \nApplicant provided a 2006 certificate of appreciation which noted, \u201cHe \ndemonstrated superb engineering and technical skills\u201d and lauded his hard work and \ncontributions to the mission (AE A). He also provided a 2007 certificate of completion for \na course (AE B), and two 2006 certificates of training (AE C, D). \n \n      \nRussian Federation \n \nThe Russian Federation is a vast and diverse nation composed of 21 republics \n(GE 6 at 1).  Its population of 142 million people is multinational and multi-ethnic. Id.  \nRussia achieved independence with the dissolution of the Soviet Union in August 1991 \n(AE N at 1).  Russia has retained a powerful military and remains a nuclear superpower \n(GE 6 at 2). The Russian government consists of a strong executive branch, a \nbicameral legislature and a weak judiciary (GE 6 at 1, AE N at 1). \n \nU.S. citizens visiting Russia must always possess a valid U.S. passport (AE N at \n1). \u201cU.S. citizens who are former Russian citizens should be aware that they may be \nviewed as Russian citizens and not allowed to leave Russia except on a Russian \npassport. Also, males who are considered Russian citizens may encounter problems if \nthey did not satisfy Russian military requirements prior to leaving for the United States\u201d \n(GE 6 at 7). \n \n\u201cAlthough there is a general risk of U.S. citizens being subjected to indiscriminate \nacts of terror in Russia, there is no current indication that Americans are targets\u201d (GE N \nat 1). Terrorist activity in Russia includes suicide bombings, hostage taking, especially \nin connection with the Chechen conflict (GE 6 at 4). Russian human rights abuses in the \nChechen conflict include torture, summary executions, use of indiscriminate force and \narbitrary detentions (GE 6 at 4). In addition to problematic behavior in the Chechen \nconflict, Russian authorities engage in arbitrary arrest and detention as well as torture \n\n \n7 \n                                                                                                                                             \nand abuse to obtain confessions (GE 6 at 5). Officials have illegally employed electronic \nsurveillance, monitored internet, telephone and email communications, and entered \nresidences without a warrant (GE 6 at 6). There is widespread government corruption \nand prison conditions are extremely harsh (GE 6 at 5). Government pressure and \ncensoring of the media and endemic crime are also significant Russian problems (GE 6 \nat 5). The Russian legislature has passed a series of reforms in Russian criminal \nprocedural laws, making their law more consistent with Western standards (AE N at 3). \nRussian human rights performance has improved in some areas (GE 6 at 4-5).  \n \nRussia has an active, ongoing collection program targeting sensitive U.S. \nindustrial and military technology as well as commercial and dual-use technology (GE 6 \nat 2-3). Russia also targets national security and environmental researchers as well as \nsignal intelligence (GE 6 at 3). Russia provides technology to other countries that has \nthe potential to be used in the construction of weapons of mass destruction, \nbiotechnology and missiles (GE 6 at 3). \u201cRegional branches of the [Federal Security \nService] reportedly continued to exert pressure on citizens employed by foreign firms \nand organizations, often to coerce them into becoming informants\u201d (GE at 6). \n \nRussia and the United States are frequently aligned on political initiatives and \nhave joined in numerous international agreements, including efforts to resolve \ninternational political problems at the United Nations (AE N at 2-3). For example, the \nUnited States and Russia entered into a bilateral World Trade Organization accession \nagreement in 2006 (AE N at 4). In 2007, Russia imported U.S. goods valued at $7.4 \nbillion (AE N at 2). Russia and United States are allies in the war on terrorism, and both \nseek to suppress the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Both countries have \nspecially emphasized the reduction of strategic arsenals (AE N at 2).  \u201cSince 1992, the \nUnited States has spent over $7 billion in [Cooperative Threat Reduction or] CTR (or \n\u201cNunn-Lugar\u201d) funds and related programs to help Russia dismantle nuclear weapons \nand ensure the security of its nuclear weapons, weapons grade material, other weapons \nof mass destruction, and related technical know-how.\u201d (AE N at 2-3).  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nIn an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s security suitability, an administrative judge must \nconsider Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which sets forth adjudicative guidelines. In \naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines \nare divided into Disqualifying Conditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC), which are \nused to determine an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible ironclad rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge should apply \nthese guidelines in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process \nprovision in Section E2.2, Enclosure 2, of the Directive. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \n \nBecause the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole person concept,\u201d an administrative judge should consider all \n\n \n8 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, the \nfinal decision in each case is arrived at by applying the standard that the issuance of the \nclearance is \u201cclearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.6 The government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive. Once the government has \nproduced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to produce evidence and prove a mitigating condition. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 \nprovides, \u201cThe applicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by \nDepartment Counsel, and [applicant] has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to \nobtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d The burden of disproving a mitigating \ncondition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. \nSep. 22, 2005).7 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. It is a \nrelationship that transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours \nas well. It is because of this special relationship the government must be able to repose \na high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions under this Directive include, by necessity, \nconsideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to \nprotect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of \nlegally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise \nof classified information. \n  \nThe scope of an administrative judge\u2019s decision is limited. Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, and patriotism are not at issue in these proceedings. Section 7 of Executive \nOrder 10865 specifically provides industrial security clearance decisions shall be \u201cin \n \n6 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as \nadequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-\n11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1).  \u201cThis is something less than the weight \nof the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not \nprevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d  Consolo v. Federal Maritime \nComm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a \npreponderance.\u201d  See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n7\u201fThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, [evaluates] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and [decides] whether Applicant [has] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d  \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n\n \n9 \n                                                                                                                                             \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d  See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \nSecurity clearance decisions cover many characteristics of an applicant other than \nallegiance, loyalty, and patriotism. Nothing in this Decision should be construed to \nsuggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied \ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the following with respect to the allegations set forth in the SOR: \n \nForeign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d \nstating: \n \nif the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, [he or \nshe] may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication \nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign \ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign \ncountry is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n \nApplicant\u2019s sister (SA) and her common law husband (SH) are citizens and \nresidents of Russia. SA has visited Applicant and his son four times in the United States \nsince 1993. After moving to the United States, he has had periodic contact with a former \nclassmate (CM) who is a citizen and resident of Russia. SA, SH and CM\u2019s employment \nis linked with the Russian government through funding. Applicant last visited Russia in \n1997. He possessed an expired Russian passport until September 15, 2008.  \n\n \n10 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country, and an Applicant has frequent, non-casual contacts with that relative, \nthis factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could \npotentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).  \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or \nduress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a \nfamily member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence operations against the United States. The complicated, \ncompetitive relationship of Russia with the United States places a significant, but not \ninsurmountable burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his relationship \nwith SA, SH, BA and SN does not pose a security risk and he is not in a position to be \nforced to choose between loyalty to the United States and these four persons.8 With its \nmixed human rights record, and political, economic and military rivalry with the United \nStates, it is conceivable that Russia would target any Russian citizen or former citizen \nliving in the United States in an attempt to gather valuable information from the United \nStates. \n \nThere is evidence that Russian intelligence operatives seek classified or \neconomic information from U.S. businesses and/or government agencies. Applicant\u2019s \nconnections to SA, SH, BA and SN create a potential conflict of interest because these \nrelationships are sufficiently close to raise a possible security concern about his desire \nto help three relatives living in the Russia and/or his son by providing classified \ninformation.    \n \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s contacts with SA, \nSH, BA and SN, his relationships with them, and his travel to Russia in 1997 to raise the \nissue of potential foreign pressure or attempted exploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) apply.  \n \n \n8An applicant with relatives in Iran, for example, has a heavier burden to overcome than an \napplicant with relatives living in Russia. See ISCR Case No. 02-13595 at 3 (App. Bd. May 10, 2005) \n(stating an applicant has \u201ca very heavy burden of persuasion to overcome the security concerns\u201d when \nparents and siblings live in Iran).

Aug. 4, 2006) \n(articulating \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d standard when an applicant has family members living in Iran); ISCR \nCase No. 07-12471 at 9 (A.J. May 30, 2008) (stating \u201cBetween January 9, 2007 and January 18, 2008, \nthe Appeal Board decided 36 appeals involving Iran under the old guidelines, and it reversed 20 decisions \ngranting clearances and affirmed 15 decisions denying clearances.\u201d And listing at 9 n.1 the pertinent \ncases).

In 1992, Applicant \nleft Russia, and returned just once in 1997 on a trip sponsored by the U.S. government. \nHe has not had any telephone or email contact with CM since January 2006, and they \nusually just exchange greetings on New Years. His relationship with CM is not a \nsecurity concern. \u201cIt is unlikely [he] will be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of [CM] and the interests of the U.S.\u201d See AG \u00b6 8(a). His \ninfrequent contacts with CM and not particularly close relationship with CM have a low \npotential of forcing him to choose between the United States and Russia. He met his \nburden of showing there is \u201clittle likelihood that [his relationship with CM] could create a \nrisk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d See generally ISCR Case No. 03-04300 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 00-0484 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2002)). \nHis contacts and communications with CM are sufficiently casual and infrequent as to \nnot create a risk of foreign influence or exploitation.   \n \n\n \n12 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) cannot be applied with respect to SA and SH. Applicant has \nan emotional bond with SA and SH. Applicant communicates with them regularly and \nfrequently. Applicant\u2019s relationships with his sister and her common-law husband (SA \nand SH) require a closer examination than his relationship with CM because Applicant \nhas greater contacts with them than with CM. SA is his relative by blood. SH is his \nrelative by common-law marriage. Although Applicant\u2019s close relationship with these \nfamily members is an important positive reflection of his character, the same close \nrelationships raise security concerns for possible foreign influence.     \n \nThere is no evidence that SA and SH have been political activists, challenging \nthe policies of the Russian Government. There is no evidence these relatives currently \nwork for or have ever worked for the Russian Government or military or any news \nmedia. There is no evidence that terrorists or the Russian Government have \napproached or threatened Applicant, SA or SH for any reason. There is no evidence \nthat these family members living in Russia currently engage in activities which would \nbring attention to them or that they or other Russian elements are even aware that \nApplicant works for a government contractor or might have access to classified \ninformation. As such, there is a reduced possibility that these relatives would be targets \nfor coercion or exploitation. But see n. 9, infra (discussing limited weight that can be \ngiven to the absence of such information). \n \nApplicant deserves some credit because of the reduced possibility that Russia \nwill exploit SA and SH because of the low profile they have in Russian society. \nApplicant\u2019s close relationship with SA and SH, his frequent contacts with them, and the \nnature of the Russian Government and its complicated, and sometimes contentious \nrelationship to the United States, all weigh against mitigating security concerns. See \nADP Case No. 05-17812 at 2, 3 n.2 (App. Bd. Jun. 11, 2007) (finding contacts with \nsiblings in PRC \u201conce every two or three  months\u201d not to be casual and infrequent); \nISCR Case No. 04-12500 at 2, 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (finding contacts with \napplicant\u2019s parents and sisters a total of about 20 times per year not casual and \ninfrequent); ISCR Case No. 04-09541 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2006) (finding contacts \nwith applicant\u2019s siblings once every four or five months not casual and infrequent).9     \n \n9In ISCR Case No. 06-17838 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 28, 2008), the Appeal Board discussed the \nprecedential value of the decisions predating the revision of the Adjudicative Guidelines indicated in n. 3, \nsupra, and determined where the language of the Directive is unchanged or not substantively altered, the \nprecedent remains valid. AG \u00b6 8(c) apparently adopted the Appeal Board\u2019s interpretation of Foreign \nInfluence Mitigating Condition 1 (FIMC 1) under the previous guidelines. The Appeal Board had \ndetermined that contacts with relatives living in a foreign country must be both casual and infrequent to \napply FIMC 1. See ISCR Case No. 04-12500 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). Moreover, contacts with such \nfamily members are presumed to be \u201cnot casual.\u201d Id. In the analysis of countervailing evidence, it is legal \nerror to give significant weight to any of the following facts or factors: applicant\u2019s ties to the United States \n(ISCR Case No. 02-13595 at 5 (App. Bd. May 10, 2005)); lack of prominence of relatives living in a \nforeign country (Id.); \u201cfamily members\u2019 low-key and noncontroversial lifestyle, and the fact that the Iranian \ngovernment has not contacted them about Applicant\u201d (ISCR Case No. 04-12500 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, \n2006); one relative living in a foreign country may be sufficient to negate FIMC 1 (ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006)); a foreign relative\u2019s fragile health (ISCR Case No. 02-29403 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 14, 2004)), advanced age (ISCR Case No. 02-00305 at 7 (App. Bd. Feb. 12, 2003), \nfinancial independence (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005), or lack of financial \ndependency upon applicant (ISCR Case No. 03-15205 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan 21, 2005)); foreign relatives \n\n \n13 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                                                                                                                            \n \nApplicant\u2019s deep relationship with his son and his strong connections to the \nUnited States tends to mitigate foreign interest security concerns. Applicant has \u201csuch \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., [he] can be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d His son is a U.S. citizens, \nand resides in the United States. Applicant and his son have lived in the United States \nsince 1993 and are fully inculcated with U.S. values. Applicant frequently visits and \ncommunicates with his son, who lives hundreds of miles away in a different state. His \nson is Applicant\u2019s closest relative. Applicant has worked for government contractors with \ndedication and distinction. He has buried his wife in a cemetery in the United States and \npurchased a plot in the same cemetery for himself.  He has substantial property and \ninvestments in the United States, and no property or investments in Russia. He has \nmany friends and colleagues in the United States. He is a loyal, dedicated U.S. citizen. \nHe has provided letters and witness statements to corroborate his loyalty and \ntrustworthiness. \n \nForeign Preference \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 9 the security concern involving foreign preference arises, \u201c[W]hen \nan individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over \nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make \ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d \n \nAG \u00b6 10(a) describes one condition that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying in Applicant\u2019s case, \u201c(a) exercise of any right, privilege or obligation of \nforeign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a \nfamily member.  This includes but is not limited to:  (1) possession of a current foreign \npassport.\u201d Applicant possessed a Russian passport that was valid until April 23, 2002, \nestablishing AG \u00b6 10(a). \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 11(b) and 11(e) provide two conditions that mitigate security concerns for \nforeign preference stating, \u201c(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce \ndual citizenship\u201d and \u201c(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the \ncognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated.\u201d Applicant credibly stated he was \nwilling to renounce his Russian citizenship to an investigator from the Office of \nPersonnel Management and subsequently at his hearing. At his hearing he was advised \nthat there was a security concern under Guideline C because he retained his expired \n \nspend part of each year in the U.S. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)); the lack of \nany connection between the foreign relative and the foreign government in question (ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)); the absence of any attempt at exploitation in the past (ISCR Case \nNo. 03-15205 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2005)); a foreign country\u2019s friendly relationship with the U.S., its \nstable, democratic government, or its extensive foreign military agreements with the United States (ISCR \nCase No. 02-22461 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Oct. 27, 2005))  and an applicant\u2019s \u201crefusal to travel to Iran\u201d and \n\u201cmeticulous work habits and practice of strictly following the rules relating to his work\u201d (ISCR Case No. 03-\n15205 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2005)). Notwithstanding the Appeal Board\u2019s position, I conclude that many \nof these attributes are pertinent to the analysis in this case under the whole person concept. \n \n\n \n14 \n                                                                                                                                             \nRussian passport. On September 15, 2008, he obtained his Russian passport and \nprovided it to his security officer, who destroyed it (AE L).   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nIn all adjudications, the protection of our national security is the paramount \nconcern. The adjudicative process is a careful weighing of a number of variables in \nconsidering the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept. It recognizes that we should view a person by \nthe totality of his or her acts, omissions, and motivations as well as various other \nvariables. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into consideration all \nrelevant circumstances and applying sound judgment, mature thinking, and careful \nanalysis.  Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at Directive \u00b6 E2.2.1:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the \nvoluntariness of participation; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other pertinent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E2.2.3, \u201cThe ultimate determination of whether the granting or \ncontinuing of eligibility for a security clearance is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security must be an overall common sense determination based upon careful \nconsideration\u201d of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nApplicant promised to report any Russian contact seeking information to law \nenforcement authorities. I found this promise to be sincere and credible. However, in \nISCR Case No. 06-24575 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 9, 2007), the Appeal Board reversed an \nadministrative judge\u2019s decision to grant a PRC Applicant\u2019s clearance because he gave \ntoo much weight to the Applicant\u2019s \u201cstrong ties to the U.S.\u201d and determined there was \ninsufficient evidentiary support for the conclusion that he \u201ccan be trusted to resolve any \nconflict of interest . . . in favor of the U.S.\u201d The Applicant in ISCR Case No. 06-24575 \nsaid he would not act against the U.S. if faced with the choice. However, the Appeal \nBoard gives such promises little weight in their de novo review of the evidence,10 \nstating: \n                                            \n \n10 The Supreme Court in United States v. Raddatz, 447 U.S. 667, 690 (1980) succinctly defined \nthe phrase \"de novo determination\": \n \n[This legal term] has an accepted meaning in the law. It means an independent \ndetermination of a controversy that accords no deference to any prior resolution of the \nsame controversy. Thus, in Renegotiation Board v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., 415 U.S. 1, \n23 [(1974)], the Court had occasion to define \u201cde novo proceeding\u201d as a review that was \n\"unfettered by any prejudice from the [prior] agency proceeding and free from any claim \nthat the [agency's] determination is supported by substantial evidence.\" And, in United \n\n \n15 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                                                                                                                            \n \nAn Applicant\u2019s stated intention as to what he would do in the future is of \nrelatively little weight, given the record in this case. See ISCR Case No. \n03-09053 at (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2006) (\u201cAn applicant\u2019s stated intention \nabout what he or she might do in the future under some hypothetical set of \ncircumstances is merely a statement of intention that is not entitled to \nmuch weight, unless there is record evidence that the applicant has acted \nin a similar manner in the past under similar circumstances.\u201d) \n \nId. at 4. See also ISCR Case No. 07-00029 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2007) (criticizing the \nadministrative judge\u2019s reliance on PRC-Applicant\u2019s promise to choose the U.S. over \nPRC should a conflict arise, and reversing the administrative judge\u2019s decision to grant a \nclearance).  I respect the Appeal Board\u2019s position and give little weight to Applicant\u2019s \npromise to report any such contacts that might occur. \n    \nA Guideline B decision concerning the Russia must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situation in Russia, as well as the dangers existing in Russia.11 Russia is a \ndiplomatic and strategic partner of the United States in some areas where both \ncountries have mutual interests. For example, Russia is a key partner in efforts to \nreduce proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and control of nuclear materials.  \nRussia\u2019s relationship with the United States has significantly changed over the decades \nand is likely to change again in the future. Russia was an important U.S. ally in World \nWar II, and then an enemy of the United States during the Korean and Vietnam Wars. \nRussia was the United States\u2019 primary antagonist through the Cold war. Russia has a \nmixed to poor human rights record. Russia is one of the most aggressive nations in the \ncollection of U.S. intelligence and sensitive economic information. Although terrorists in \nRussia are not known to target relatives of Americans such as SA and SH, there is a \nsignificant problem in Russia with terrorists, which is a factor in the analysis. \n \nOne element increasing the foreign influence security concern is Applicant\u2019s \nfrequent contacts with SA and SH, and SA\u2019s four visits to the United States since 1993. \nApplicant clearly has a close relationship with SA and SN, and they are vulnerable to \n \nStates v. First City National Bank, 386 U.S. 361, 368 [(1967)], this Court observed that \n\"review de novo\" means \"that the court should make an independent determination of the \nissues\" and should \"not . . .  give any special weight to the [prior] determination of\" the \nadministrative agency.  \n \n(internal footnotes omitted).

Dec. 14, 2007), the Appeal Board \ncriticized the administrative judge\u2019s analysis, supporting grant of a clearance for a PRC-related Applicant, \nand then decided the case itself. Judge White\u2019s dissenting opinion cogently explains why credibility \ndeterminations and ultimately the decision whether to grant or deny a clearance should be left to the \njudge who makes witness credibility determinations. Id. at 5-7. See also ISCR Case No. 04-06386 at 10-\n11 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2006) (Harvey, J., dissenting) (discussing limitations on Appeal Board\u2019s authority to \nreverse hearing-level judicial decisions and recommends remanding cases to resolve material, prejudicial \nerror). \n \n11 See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd. May 23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient \ndiscussion of geopolitical situation and suggesting expansion of whole person discussion).  \n \n\n \n16 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \nRussian coercion and non-coercive measures because of their Russian citizenship and \nwhere they live. They also receive a social security type pension, and the Russian \ngovernment could exert pressure on them by threatening to stop or stopping their \npensions. Because Russian government and intelligence personnel may violate \nRussian law, they are more likely to use improper and/or illegal means to obtain \nclassified information through SA and SH.   \n \nThere are significant factors supporting approval of Applicant\u2019s access to \nclassified information. Applicant has lived in the United States since 1993 (except for his \nvisit to Russia in 1997, which was sponsored by the U.S. government, and a brief visit \nto India). He became a U.S. citizen in 2001. His wife is buried in the United States and \nhe has purchased a cemetery plot close to her, showing his intention to be buried in the \nUnited States. Applicant\u2019s closest relative is his son, who is a U.S. citizen with a career \nin the United States. Applicant is an excellent employee and U.S. citizen. He \ncompellingly explained why his loyalty is to the United States, rather than to the Russia. \nThe United States follows the Rule of Law, and Russian authorities do not necessarily \ndo so. He thoroughly developed the evidence showing his connections to the United \nStates and to the Russia. I found his statements to be honest, candid and credible. He \nprovided corroborating statements concerning his loyalty and trustworthiness. He \nprovided favorable recommendations of employers and friends going back to the time of \nhis entry into the United States.   \n \nIn a 2006 decision, the Appeal Board held the Judge properly determined under \nthe \u201cwhole person\u201d concept that an applicant with very significant connections to Russia \nhad mitigated security concerns under Guideline B.  In ISCR Case No. 03-04300, 2006 \nDOHA Lexis 264 at *17-*21 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2006),12 the applicant had weekly \ncontact with her mother (who lives in Russia), contact three times per year with her aunt \n(who lives in Russia); contact about four times per year with her father-in-law (who lives \nin Russia); and multiple annual contacts with other relatives living in Israel. She had \nvisited her family in Russia and Israel, on more than one occasion, after immigrating to \nthe United States. Moreover, she owned a half interest in her mother\u2019s apartment in \nRussia, and provided financial support to her mother and aunt. The Judge\u2019s whole \nperson analysis (that the Appeal Board determined was sufficient to mitigate such \nsignificant foreign influence security concerns) provides: \n     \nLooking at all of [whole person] factors, I conclude Applicant has \novercome foreign influence security concerns. Given her strong ties to the \nU.S. and her limited contact with Russia and Israel since she became a \nU.S. naturalized citizen, there is limited potential for coercion, exploitation \nor duress. (E.2.2.1.8. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress.)  All of her immediate family are in the U.S., and the majority of \nher financial ties are in the U.S. Applicant has been a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen for over fifteen years. She returned to Russia in April 2005 to \nabjure her Russian citizenship and has had limited visits with her mother, \n \n12The Appeal Board reversed the Judge\u2019s decision to grant a clearance because of the strict \nrequirements of the Money Memorandum (Applicant in ISCR Case No. 03-04300 had not turned in her \nRussian passport to the Russian government by the close of evidence).   \n\n \n17 \n                                                                                                                                             \n                                           \naunt and father-in-law in 1995 and 2002. She provides minimal support to \nher mother and aunt. She has only visited her sister and family in Israel in \n1991, 1994, and 1997. While she has contact with her relatives in Russia \nand her relatives in Israel, that contact is limited.  While her niece serves \nin the Israeli military, she has limited contact with her.  Clearly, she put her \ninterests in the U.S. ahead of her loyalty to her elderly mother when she \nchose to renounce her Russian citizenship. \n \nGiven her long history with her employer since April 2000, it is unlikely that \nshe could be exploited by coercive or non-coercive means by the \ngovernment in Russia or in Israel in a way that could force Applicant to \nchoose between loyalty to her mother, aunt, father-in-law, her sibling and \nfamily and her loyalty to the United States. She stated that should any \nsuch attempt be made she would immediately contact the appropriate \nU.S. authorities. Thus, any risk of either coercive or non-coercive foreign \nduress or influence on Applicant and/or her immediate family would \nappear to be slight and clearly manageable. Contacts with citizens of other \ncountries are relevant to security determinations only if they make an \nindividual potentially vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or pressure \nthrough threats against those foreign relatives. \n \n \nWhile clearance decisions are inherently based on numerous facts, and as such \nare made after a case-by-case analysis, it is beyond debate that the applicant in ISCR \nCase No. 03-04300 had more significant connections to Russia than the Applicant does \nin this case. Whereas, the applicant\u2019s connections to the United States in ISCR Case \nNo. 03-04300 and in this case are similar.13  \n \n \nAfter carefully weighing the evidence of his connections to Russia, and to the \nUnited States, I conclude Applicant has carried his burden of fully mitigating the foreign \ninfluence and foreign preference security concerns.  \n \n           I take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d14 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. For the \nreasons stated, I conclude he is eligible for access to classified information.    \n \n \n13In ISCR Case No. 03-04300 the applicant\u2019s connections to the U.S. are as follows:  (1) the \napplicant\u2019s husband and son live in the United States, and they are both dual citizens of Russia and the \nU.S.; and (2) The applicant has lived in the U.S. since 1989.  The applicant in ISCR Case No. 03-04300 is \na professional with post-doctorate teaching employment. \n \n14See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).  \n\n \n18 \n                                                                                                                                             \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:    \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.d: \n For Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline C:    \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security clearance \nfor Applicant.

Applicant is 26 years old and has worked for a federal contractor since November 2006. He is also a full-time doctorate student in American History. He has held an interim security clearance since his employment in 2006 until it was revoked. Applicant was born in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE) to parents of Indian nationality.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance is granted. \n \nOn October 7, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nto Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuidelines B and C. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 22, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on November 10, \n2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on November 12, 2008, scheduling the hearing \nfor November 24, 2008, at the request of Applicant. On November 18, 2008, Applicant \n \n1 \n \n \nDecember 30, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nrequested a continuance, which was unopposed by Department Counsel and the \nrequest was granted. An amended Notice of Hearing was issued on November 19, \n2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled on December 15, 2008. The government \noffered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3. Applicant did not object and they were admitted. \nApplicant and three witnesses testified. Applicant submitted Exhibits (AE) A-O. \nDepartment Counsel did not object and they were admitted. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 22, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR and provided explanations. \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 26 years old and has worked for a federal contractor since \nNovember 2006. He is also a full-time doctorate student in American History. He has \nheld an interim security clearance since his employment in 2006 until it was revoked.  \n \n \nApplicant was born in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE) to parents of \nIndian nationality. His parents were working in the UAE before they immigrated to \nCanada in 1988. They had hoped to immigrate to the United States, but the wait for \npermanent residency was approximately eight years and the wait in Canada was very \nshort. Applicant\u2019s father works as a manager in the hotel industry and his mother is a \nsmall business owner. Both parents became Canadian citizens and renounced their \nIndian citizenship in 1993. As a minor, Applicant also became a Canadian citizen. In \n1994, his parents applied for permanent residency in the U.S. In 1996, they were \ngranted permanent residency in the U.S., as was Applicant. Applicant and his parents \nbecame naturalized U.S. citizens in July 2002. They retained their dual citizenship \nstatus with Canada. Applicant\u2019s mother lives in Canada and his father lives in the U.S. \nwhere he continues to work in the hotel industry.1 \n \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in Canada in 1999 and attended college for \none year there. After his first year of college, during the summer, he worked as a paid \nintern for one of the local offices of a Canadian ministry. He then attended a prestigious \nU.S. university where he graduated in 2003. During the 2000-2001 academic year \nApplicant applied for an academic internship through his university at a prestigious \nschool of economics in the United Kingdom (UK). This internship was coordinated \nthrough his college and the British institution. He was assigned as an unpaid intern to \nthe office of a minister in the British government. This internship occurred before \nApplicant was a U.S. citizen. From January 2002 to June 2002, Applicant was a visiting \nstudent at another prestigious British university. He received a scholarship from his U.S. \nuniversity to participate in the study abroad program. During his vacations from school \nand over the summer he would return to his mother\u2019s home in Canada to visit her. After \nhe graduated from college he attended an intensive language program at a U.S. \n \n1 Tr. 38-44, 63-64. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \ncollege. Applicant was accepted into a two-year master\u2019s program at Oxford University \nin Britain for the academic year beginning in the fall of 2004. While waiting to attend \nschool Applicant could not find a job in the U.S. so he returned to Canada where he \nlived with his mother and saved on living expenses. He had hoped to work in the U.S for \na Congressman, but because he did not have a connection to any district he could not \nget an appointment. From October 2003 to January 2004 he worked the night shift at a \nconvenience store; from April 2004 to July 2004 he worked as a tutor for the Salvation \nArmy, and he worked one week for the local state assemblyman in his town. He left the \nlocal assemblyman\u2019s employment after a week when he realized the job was clerical \nwork. He had hoped it would be more of a learning position, but it was not.2  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s masters program was unfunded so he needed to find a job to pay his \nexpenses. While studying at Oxford, during vacations the students are not permitted to \nstay on campus. Applicant needed to also find a place to stay and pay for his expenses. \nHe attended a political dinner and met a person who was running a government \nminister\u2019s reelection campaign. He was offered a job with the minister\u2019s campaign \nreelection team. He worked about a month on the campaign. He credibly testified that \nhe did not work for the British government as there is a strict separation between \ngovernment employees working on political campaign. He did work for the minister\u2019s \nreelection campaign and the minister is obviously part of the British government. In the \nspring of 2005, Applicant returned to vacation in Canada with his mother. The second \nyear of his master\u2019s studies required extensive research which he conducted in the U.S. \nat different academic and historical venues. He then returned to Canada to complete \nthe writing of his thesis. In January 2006, Applicant returned to Oxford and completed \nhis master\u2019s degree in July 2006.3  \n \nWhile at Oxford Applicant become friends with a British citizen (Citizen P) whose \nmother is a Russian citizen and father a British citizen. Citizen P completed his \nundergraduate degree in Russia and was doing his graduate work at Oxford. In 2006 \nApplicant visited Russia for ten days. The purpose of the trip was for sightseeing and \nalso to see if he could gain access to Russian archives to do research on a project. \nWhen Applicant traveled to Russia, he used his American passport. Applicant stayed at \nthe Russia family home of Citizen P. The Russian government denied Applicant access \nto their archives.4  \n \nApplicant has maintained some contact with Citizen P through emails since \ncompleting his studies abroad. Their primary relationship is based on their mutual \nacademic interests. Citizen P is an accomplished scholar who is working on his \ndoctorate and Applicant is hoping that Citizen P will be invited by his university to \n \n2 Tr. 44-57; 71-73, 97-104, 113-115; AE N. \n \n3 Tr. 90-97. \n \n4 Tr. 57-60, 74-76, 104-110. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \npresent his research at an academic gathering. Applicant provided all of his email \ncorrespondence with Citizen P since he left the university.5  \n \nAfter completing his masters degree Applicant returned to Canada to visit his \nmother, before moving to the U.S. where he was accepted into a doctoral program at \nanother prestigious university. Through his contacts at the university he was offered a \njob as a contractor with the Department of State. He accepted the job in November \n2006 and has been employed with the contractor since them. He is a full-time student, \nteaching assistant, and a part-time contractual employee. He has completed about one \nhalf of his studies. His job has inhibited him devoting all of his time to working on his \nPh.D.6 \n \nApplicant applied for a visa through Canada in 2004 to attend school in Britain. \nHe was not aware that this would have an impact on his future ability to obtain a \nsecurity clearance. He was living in Canada with his mother waiting to attend school \nand applied through Canada out of convenience. He did not have an address in the \nU.S. and it would have required him to travel to the U.S. and mail the application from \nthere, return to Canada and wait for the application to be returned to an address in the \nU.S. He decided it was less complicated to apply for it under his Canadian citizenship.7  \n \n \nWhile living in Canada from 2003 to 2004 and working at the convenience store \nApplicant fortuitously met a former high school friend. They reacquainted and his friend \nworks as a chef locally in Applicant\u2019s home city. His friend is Canadian. When Applicant \nvisits the city he and his friend will occasionally get together.8  \n \n \nApplicant voted in a Canadian national election in 2006 and a local election in \n2005. He has not voted in Canada since because he does not have ties with the \ncountry. He did not know or understand the security clearance implications when he \nvoted. He has also voted in U.S. elections.9 \n \n \nApplicant was unaware of the security implication created by retaining his \nCanadian citizenship. He credibly testified that since becoming a U.S citizen he has \nalways been totally loyal to only the U.S. It was always his intention to live permanently \nin the U.S. He chose to remain in the U.S. to study for his Ph.D even though it would \ntake him a longer period of time. His mother has remained in Canada because she \n \n5 Tr. 104-110; AE I. \n \n6 Tr.59-62, 80-81. \n \n7 Tr. 58-59, 79, 120. \n \n8 Tr. 76-78. \n \n9 Tr. 68-69, 88; AE K. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nwanted to maintain a stable home because his father is in a job that changes locations \noften. She did not want to live in hotel rooms, so she stayed in Canada.10  \n \n \nApplicant let his Canadian passport expire and formally renounced his Canadian \ncitizenship. He credibly stated that he was never asked to relinquish his Canadian \ncitizenship. Had he been asked he would have willingly done so. He believed that his \nsole willingness to renounce his Canadian citizenship was sufficient and did not believe \na formal renunciation was necessary. He has since formally, unconditionally, and \nwithout reservation renounced his Canadian citizenship.11 His only ties to Canada are \nhis mother and his younger brother who live there. His brother hopes to move to the \nU.S. in the future.12  \n \n \nAppellant has approximately $40,000 in assets all located in the U.S. He has no \nassets in any other country.13 \n \n \nA government employee who has worked with Applicant and is the \u201cTop Secret \nControl and Alternate Unit Security Officer\u201d testified on behalf of Applicant. He considers \nApplicant to be one of the most honest employees he has worked with. He is more \nconscientious than any one of his other employees and during the two years Applicant \nheld an interim security clearance he adopted every security practice and scrupulously \nmaintained \u201ca need to know\u201d protection of classified information. Applicant has a strong \ncode of ethics and is the least likely person he knows who would succumb to social \npressures. He is meticulous in the quality of his work and his complete loyalty to the \nU.S. is unquestioned. If he was to choose his own successor to maintain the protection \nof classified information, he would choose Applicant.14 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s direct supervisor, a State Department employee testified on behalf of \nApplicant. He deals with classified information on a daily basis. He met Applicant in \nNovember 2006 and Applicant has worked directly for him since April 2007. He believes \nApplicant has consistently demonstrated that he is trustworthy and honest. Applicant is \na role model in handling classified information. He believes Applicant\u2019s loyalty is to the \nU.S.15  \n \n \nA coworker who has worked with Applicant on a project since April 2007 testified \non behalf of Applicant. He stated Applicant always followed all of the security rules and \n \n10 Tr. 80. \n \n11 AE A, B, C, D, E, F, G. \n \n12 Tr. 65-68, 118-119. \n \n13 Tr. 80-82; AE J. \n \n14 Tr. 135-142. \n \n15 Tr. 144-151. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \nis one of the hardest workers he knows. He implicitly trusts him and respects and knows \nApplicant was very proud when he became a U.S. citizen.16  \n \n \nAt his present job Applicant coauthored an article for the Agency\u2019s magazine. It \nreferences him as a Ph.D student and noted his commitment to a nationally important \nand prestigious project he has been working on.17 \n \nCanada18 \n \n \n\u201cThe relationship between the United States and Canada is the closest and most \nextensive in the world.\u201d There is a staggering volume of trade and people to people \ncontact with over 300,000 people crossing the border daily. The two countries work \nclosely in a vast number of fields ranging from law enforcement to environmental \nprotection and on multiple government levels from federal to local. Canada considers its \ngood relations with the U.S. critical to a wide range of interests and often looks to the \nU.S. as a common cause partner, promoting democracy around the world. The U.S. \ndefense arrangements with Canada are more extensive than with any other country. \nThe two military forces have cooperated since 1958 on continental air defense within \nthe North American Aerospace Defense Command. The U.S. and Canada enjoy an \neconomic partnership unique in the world. The two nations share the world\u2019s largest and \nmost comprehensive trading relationship. The U.S. is Canada\u2019s leading agricultural \nmarket. The two countries enjoy the largest energy trade relationship and one of the \nlargest investment relationships in the world.  \n \nUnited Kingdom19 \n \n \nThe United Kingdom is one of the United States\u2019 closest allies. British foreign \npolicy is closely coordinated with the U.S. Their bilateral cooperation is reflected in their \ncommon language, ideals, and democratic practices. The two countries\u2019 alliances were \nstrengthened during both World Wars and as founding members of NATO, the Korean \nconflict, in the Persian Gulf War and Operation Iraqi Freedom. The two countries \ncontinually consult on major issues, such as foreign policy, global problems, and \nsecurity policy objectives. The United Kingdom is the fifth largest market for U.S. goods \nexports and the sixth largest supplier of U.S. imports. It is also a large source for U.S. \ntourists and visa-versa. The two countries share the world\u2019s largest foreign direct \ninvestment partnership.  \n \n \n \n \n16 Tr.124-132. \n \n17 AE O. \n \n18 AE M: U.S. Department of State: Background Note: Canada, November 2008.

In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \nUnder AG \u00b6 9 the security concern involving foreign preference arises: \u201cWhen an \nindividual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over the \nUnited States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make decisions \nthat are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 10 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying: I have specifically considered AG \u00b6 10 (a) (\u201cexercise of any right, privilege \nor obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign \ncitizenship of a family member, including but not limited to (1) possession of a current \nforeign passport\u2026 (7) voting in a foreign election\u201d); (b) (\u201caction to acquire or obtain \nrecognition of a foreign citizenship by an American citizen\u201d) and (c) (\u201cperforming or \nattempting to perform duties, or otherwise acting, so as to serve the interests of a \nforeign person, group, organization, or government in conflict with the national security \ninterests\u201d). Applicant was a dual citizen of Canada and United States. He used his \nCanadian passport when applying for a student visa to attend school in the United \nKingdom. He voted in a Canadian election after he was a U.S. citizen. He worked for a \nweek for a Canadian ministry office and served as an intern and campaign worker for a \nmember of the British ministry. I find the above disqualifying conditions apply. \nI have considered all the mitigating conditions applicable to this guideline. \nSpecifically I have considered AG \u00b6 11 (a) (\u201cdual citizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 \ncitizenship or birth in a foreign country\u201d); (b) (\u201cthe individual has expressed a willingness \nto renounce dual citizenship\u201d); (c) (\u201cexercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of \nforeign citizenship occurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the \nindividual was a minor\u201d); (e) (\u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the \ncognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated\u201d), and (f) (\u201cthe vote in a foreign \nelection was encouraged by the United States Government\u201d). Applicant became a \ncitizen of Canada when he was a minor and through his parents. He later became a \nnaturalized citizen of the U.S. along with his parents. He was unaware that to extinguish \nany security clearance implications he needed to express a willingness to renounce his \ndual citizenship with Canada. Since becoming aware he has formally renounced his \ncitizenship ties with Canada. His Canadian passport is no longer valid. Applicant did use \nit as a matter of convenience when he was applying for visa. Applicant is a loyal U.S. \ncitizen who was a young college student when he used his passport. He also voted in a \nCanadian election not truly understanding the significance or impact it would have on \nhim applying for a security clearance. He credibly testified that he is loyal to only one \ncountry and that is the U.S. His unpaid internship with a British minister was an \neducational opportunity that is encouraged by colleges and universities. In addition, I \nfind Applicant\u2019s employment working for a British minister\u2019s campaign was a means of \nemployment so Applicant could pay his expense. It was quite simply a job and an \neducational experience and not a political statement. Applicant needed to make money \nto support himself and found an interesting educational job. While living in Canada \n\n \n9 \n \n \nwaiting to attend Oxford he worked for one week for a local minister\u2019s office. Applicant\u2019s \njobs in the United Kingdom and Canada were means to make money and not a \nreflection of his loyalty to another country. He worked in Canada because he could not \nfind a job in the U.S. He was able to live with his mother and save money. I do not find \nbased on these contacts and actions that he would be prone to make decisions that are \nharmful to the interest of the U.S. because of his ties to Canada or the United Kingdom, \nclearly two of the U.S. strongest allies.  \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 expresses the security concern regarding foreign influence: \u201cForeign \ncontacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided loyalties or \nforeign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, \ngroup, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable \nto pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can \nand should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether \nthe foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The SOR alleged under this guideline that Applicant\u2019s mother, father, and \nbrother are dual citizens of Canada and the U.S. It also alleged that after becoming a \nU.S. citizen he lived in Canada primarily when he was not attending school in the U.S. \nor United Kingdom and he held jobs in Canada during some of that time. He also \nexchanged emails with a British citizen who is studying in the United Kingdom but has \nfamily in Russia. Applicant also visits with a high school friend when Applicant is in \nCanada. The friend is Canadian and lives in Canada. I have considered all of the \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 7. (a) (\u201ccontact with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d); (b) (\u201cconnections to a foreign person, \ngroup, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the \nindividual \u2018s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesires to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information\u201d); (d) \n(\u201csharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that \nrelationship creates a heightened  risk of foreign inducement, manipulation , pressure or \ncoercion\u201d) and (e) (\u201ca substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject the \nindividual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation\u201d). I have carefully \nreviewed all of the allegations and the facts of this case. The countries of interest are \nCanada and the United Kingdom, two of the United States\u2019 strongest and most loyal \nallies, not countries that are known to target U.S. citizens. Applicant\u2019s contacts with dual \ncitizens of Canada and the U.S. do not create a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion. The time Applicant lived and worked in \nCanada and lived, worked and studied in the United Kingdom also does not create a \n\n \n10 \n \n \nsecurity concern. Applicant does not have divided loyalties and credibly testified that he \nis loyal to only the U.S. All of Applicant\u2019s financial interests are in the U.S. I do not find \nexchanging emails with a citizen of the United Kingdom who has family ties in Russia or \nvisiting a Canadian citizen when he is in Canada creates a security concern. After \ncareful consideration of all of the above facts and even taking the most expansive \ninterpretation of the disqualifying conditions I find none of them apply.  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a young man who \nimmigrated with his parents to Canada first because they could obtain permanent \nresidency quicker than in the U.S. Once eligible they became U.S. citizens. He was a \ncollege student in the U.S. and was offered the opportunity to study abroad in the \nUnited Kingdom. He was also offered an educational opportunity to intern with the \nBritish government. Later to earn money he was a paid campaign worker. His work was \nto earn money not promote a political cause. Applicant would return to his mother\u2019s \nhome in Canada during vacation periods and summer recess. He was unaware of the \nsecurity ramifications in retaining his Canadian passport and has renounced his \nCanadian citizenship and his passport has expired. He did vote in a Canadian election \nin 2006. Applicant is earning his doctorate degree in American History. He has worked \nfor the past two years with an interim clearance and his supervisors and coworker are \nconfident that his loyalty is only to the U.S. and he is vigilant in his security awareness. \nBased on all of the evidence and my analysis above, the record leaves me with no \nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising \nfrom Foreign Preference and Foreign Influence.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.h: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFor APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.g: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances it is clearly consistent with national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

Mendez, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by her criminal conduct \nand alcohol use. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \nOn October 17, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct and Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on December 10, 2008, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February 11, 2009. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on February 25, 2009, and the hearing was convened \nas scheduled on March 17, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, \nMarch 31, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \nwhich were received without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf, called one \nwitness, and submitted Exhibits (AE) A through C, which were received without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on March 25, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has an \nassociate\u2019s degree. She is single and has a 19-year-old daughter.1  \n \n \nApplicant was cited in December 1992 for failure to maintain financial \nresponsibility. She did not have car insurance at the time. She was fined $175. The \ncharge is not listed on the FBI Identification Record submitted in evidence.2  \n \n \nApplicant was charged with disorderly conduct in July 1995. She was found \nguilty. She does not recall the circumstances surrounding the charge. There is no \nevidence as to what the sentence was for the charge.3  \n \n \nApplicant was charged with issuing a bad check in September 1996. She \nadmitted that she wrote a check that was returned for nonsufficient funds. The court set \nup a payment plan for her to pay the check. She missed a payment and a bench \nwarrant was issued. She was arrested for the bench warrant in February 1997. She \nmade all the required payments and the bench warrant was withdrawn.4  \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in September 1996, and charged with driving while \nintoxicated (DWI). Her blood alcohol was tested at .15%, and a short time later at \n.152%. Applicant pled guilty and was sentenced to probation for 18 months and a $500 \nfine. She attended several Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings as part of her \nprobation.5 \n \n \nApplicant and a friend were driving aboard a military installation in September \n2000. They were coming from a bar and the friend was driving her car. They both had \nbeen drinking and she had smoked marijuana. It is unclear if her friend had also \nsmoked marijuana. They were stopped by the military police after he failed to stop at a \nstop sign. His driver\u2019s license was suspended. The officer noted an alcohol smell \ncoming from the vehicle and he was given a breath test, which measured .059%. The \ncar was searched and marijuana was found. Applicant was charged with wrongful \npossession of marijuana. She pled guilty and was sentenced to probation for two years \nand a $1,000 fine. She was not required to attend Alcoholics Anonymous meetings but \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 26, 40, 44; GE 1. \n \n2 Tr. at 27; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 4. \n \n3 Tr. at 28; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR. \n \n4 Tr. at 28-29; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR. \n \n5 Tr. at 24, 29-31; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 3. \n \n\n \n3 \n \nfor approximately a six month period, she voluntarily attended about eight to ten \nmeetings. She has not used illegal drugs since she went to court for this incident in \nabout January 2001. She did not stop drinking, which she did every day.6 \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in February 2007, and charged with driving while \nintoxicated, second offense. The police indicated that she almost hit the police car. The \narrest was videotaped. Applicant\u2019s blood alcohol was tested at .24%, which is far more \nthan double the legal limit. She pled guilty and was sentenced to a $2,000 fine and her \ndriver\u2019s license was suspended for a year.7 \n \n \nApplicant continued to drink after the latest DWI. She admitted that she drank on \na daily basis through about May 2007. She drank about six to eight beers a day and \nwould drink to what she considered a level of intoxication, which was about 12 or more \nbeers, about four to five times a month. She stated that after she stopped smoking \nmarijuana, she essentially replaced the marijuana with alcohol. She provided \ninconsistent information about her current alcohol consumption. She told the \nbackground investigator in September 2007 that she had not drank alcohol since May \n2007, and she had no future plans to drink alcohol because of the problems it caused \nher and her family.8 She wrote in her response to the SOR: \n \nI have exercised very poor judgment in the past and have since matured \nand learned from those mistakes. Unfortunately, much of my poor \njudgment and bad choices were directly related to my alcohol intake. I \nnever realized that I had a problem until 2007. The last arrest made me \nrealize that I had to change that habit and I have. Since May 2007, I have \nhad only a handful of drinks. I no longer drink every day, not even every \nweekend. I would estimate that I have drunk approximately a dozen times \nsince then and never to the point of being drunk. I now know that alcohol \nis something that I must refrain from, and that all the positive changes I \nhave made in my life up to this point would be worth nothing if I didn\u2019t \nchange that, and I have. \n \nAt the hearing, Applicant initially provided contradictory information: \n \nI do not drink anymore, have not since May. What I do instead is I call my \ndaughter, I call my mother, I call my grandmother. Sometimes I\u2019ve talked \nto [witness] about it. I even watch Intervention, just to - - I mean, I did it \nlast night, because I was so nervous. And it\u2019s just something that, you \nknow, if I look at and I see, then it reminds me of where I was before and \nwhat I could go back to.9 \n                                                          \n6 Tr. at 31-35, 44; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 4, 5. \n \n7 Tr. at 35-39; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 3. \n \n8 Tr. at 39-41; GE 2. \n \n9 Tr. at 25. \n \n\n \n4 \n \nApplicant also stated that she occasionally watches the videotape of her arrest to deter \nher from drinking. She is disgusted by her behavior in the video. She was later asked \nthe last time she had any alcohol. She stated it was \u201c[p]robably around the end of \nJanuary [2009] or beginning of February [2009].\u201d She stated that she had alcohol on \nabout eight to ten occasions since May 2007, but only in small amounts, three to four \nbeers, or less.10  \n \nApplicant has never been diagnosed as alcohol dependent or an alcohol abuser. \nWhen asked if she considered herself to be an alcoholic, she replied that she did. While \nshe has not been totally abstinent, she stated that she was \u201ctrying to get there.\u201d11 \n \n \nApplicant is highly regarded both professionally and personally. She submitted \nfive character letters and a supervisor testified on her behalf. They are aware of her \npast alcohol issues and believe she has turned her life around. She is considered to be \ndedicated, trustworthy, professional, honest, and reliable. She is recommended for a \nsecurity clearance.12 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n                                                          \n10 Tr. at 25, 38, 41-46. \n \n11 Tr. at 44-45. \n \n12 Tr. at 18-21; AE C. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted; \n \nApplicant\u2019s arrests and convictions are sufficient to raise both of the above \ndisqualifying conditions.  \n \nFour Criminal Conduct mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) through (d) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life;  \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s most serious offenses were related to substance abuse, either \nmarijuana or alcohol. She stopped smoking marijuana in about 2001, but her alcohol \nconsumption increased. Her last DWI arrest was in February 2007, just over two years \nago. There is no bright line rule as to what constitutes \u201cso much time has elapsed since \nthe criminal behavior happened\u201d under AG \u00b6 32(a), and \u201cthe passage of time without \nrecurrence of criminal activity\u201d under AG \u00b6 32(d). It depends upon the facts and \ncircumstances of each case. Two years without recurrence of criminal conduct is a very \ngood start on rehabilitation. There is other evidence of rehabilitation including remorse \nand a good employment record. My remaining concern is Applicant\u2019s issues with \nalcohol, and specifically with her contradictory answers about her alcohol consumption. \nThere is nothing ambiguous about her initial testimony when she said, \u201cI do not drink \nanymore, have not since May.\u201d She later provided totally different information. In order \nto find complete rehabilitation, there must be complete honesty. It is not clear in this \ncase that I have received that. AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and (d) are partially applicable.  \n \n \nApplicant was not pressured or coerced into committing her criminal acts. AG \u00b6 \n32(c) is not applicable. It is unclear if the failure to maintain financial responsibility \ncitation in 1992 was a criminal charge or a civil traffic violation. In either event, it is \nmitigated under AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and (d), as is the bad check offense. \n  \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21:   \n     \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n\n \n7 \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; and \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent.  \n \nApplicant was arrested and convicted in 1996 and 2007 for DWI. She drank six to \neight beers every day, and more than that four to five times a month. Her alcohol-\nrelated incidents and pattern of alcohol consumption are sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) \nand (c).  \n \nTwo Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 23 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; and  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser). \n \nI find that AG \u00b6 23(a) is partially applicable under the same rationale discussed \nabove under the Criminal Conduct section. Applicant has never been diagnosed as \nalcohol dependent or an alcohol abuser, but she admitted that she considers herself to \nbe an alcoholic. Since she has not been diagnosed as alcohol dependent, there is no \nrequirement that she be totally abstinent. She is still trying to become totally abstinent. \nShe reports responsible use. As discussed above, I remain concerned about her \ncontradictory statements about her alcohol use. AG \u00b6 23(b) is partially applicable \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n\n \n8 \n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 36 years old. Her \nsubstance abuse led to at least three convictions. It is unclear if the disorderly conduct \nconviction was alcohol-related because she does not recall the circumstances \nsurrounding the charge. Applicant drank on a daily basis and acknowledges that she \nconsiders herself to be an alcoholic. She has apparently severely cut down on her \ndrinking. Her friends, family, and co-workers have noticed a change in her life since she \nhas reduced her drinking. She is highly regarded at work. While Applicant appeared to \nbe otherwise honest at the hearing, she testified to two diametrically opposite things on \nthe core issue of the case. Moreover, this is a case that when considered in the light \nmost favorable to Applicant, still has Applicant with at least three substance-abuse-\nrelated offenses, the most recent just over two years ago. Although she has taken steps \nin the right direction toward rehabilitation, it is too early to conclude that she has tackled \nher alcohol problems. As discussed above, I am concerned about the conflicting \nstatements about her current alcohol use and therefore, I cannot find complete \nrehabilitation and mitigation.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from her criminal \nconduct and alcohol use. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Glendon, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMASON, Paul J., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SCA), on March 13,\n2006. On February 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under foreign\ninfluence (Guideline B). The action was taken pursuant to Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\nmade effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued on or after\nSeptember 1, 2006. \nApplicant submitted his answer to the SOR on February 28, 2008. DOHA issued\na notice of hearing on April 25, 2008, and the hearing was held on May 21, 2008. Based\non a careful evaluation of all the evidence in the record, Applicant\u2019s eligibility of security\nclearance access is granted. \nJuly 28, 2008\n\n2\nAt the hearing, the government submitted three exhibits (GE). The third exhibit\n(GE 3, administrative notice exhibit) contains publications from United States\nGovernment agencies that describe the government of Iran, its geopolitical problems\nwith its neighbors as well as its internal human rights record, and the various difficulties\nU.S. citizens face in traveling to the country. At the hearing, testimony was taken from\nApplicant and two witnesses. He also submitted three exhibits (AE A through AE C).\nDOHA received the transcript on June 2, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR alleges in paragraph 1 that Applicant\u2019s ties and travel to Iran raise\nforeign influence concerns. He admitted subparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c. The SOR\nalleges in paragraph 2 that Applicant\u2019s possession and use of an Iranian passport\nshows a preference for a foreign country over the United States (U.S.) Applicant\nadmitted 2.a. explaining the Iranian government only recognizes Iranian passports for\nentry into the country. In believing he was complying with Section 11.e. of the foreign\npreference guideline of Directive DoD Directive 5220.6, he indicated he would not use\nhis Iranian passport for as long as DoD mandates it, and his security clearance is\nactive. Applicant is 47 years old. He has worked for his current employer as a network\nadministrator/engineer since 1998. He seeks a security clearance. \nForeign Influence\nApplicant emigrated to the U.S. on a student visa with his mother, stepfather, and\nsister in 1977. The specific reason for his and her move to this country was education.\n(GE 2, Tr. 33) After spending a year majoring in accounting, Applicant switched majors\nand schools in about 1983. He graduated from a local university in August 1984 with a\nBachelors degree in electrical engineering. Th next year he received his U.S. citizenship\nin June 1985 while working for his first engineering job from 1984 to about 1992. He\nworked at two other employers for about six years before beginning employment with\nhis present company in August 1998. \nIn July 1968, Applicant\u2019s wife was born in Iran (SOR 1.a.), and is a citizen of the\ncountry. She graduated from an Iranian university with a degree in photography. She\nalso taught English and another language. Applicant met her in July 2004, during one of\nhis seven pleasure trips to the country. His wife came to the U.S. in May 2005 on a\nfianc\u00e9 visa, and is currently on track to receive her permanent resident card. They were\nmarried in this country five days after her arrival. She gave birth to a daughter in\nSeptember 2006, and is expecting her second child. \nApplicant\u2019s mother is a U.S. citizen, having become naturalized in December\n1978, a year after she emigrated to the U.S. with Applicant\u2019s stepfather, a U.S. citizen,\nwho was born in the U.S. She has not returned to Iran since her emigration in 1977. (Tr.\n58) Applicant\u2019s stepmother, 69 years old, was born and is a resident citizen of Iran.\n\n Applicant\u2019s father worked for the national oil company. He passed away in 1998. (Tr. 39).\n1\n3\n(SOR 1.b.) She married Applicant\u2019s father  in 1978. She worked as an accountant in an\n1\nIranian city for a sufficient number of years to draw a pension that she lives on now that\nshe is retired. \nApplicant and his father made telephonic contact about once a month between\n1977 (when his father remarried his stepmother) and 1998 (when Applicant\u2019s father\npassed away). His father was retired and living on a pension when he passed away. (Tr.\n45)\nApplicant\u2019s stepsister (SOR 1.b.) was born in May 1981, and is a resident citizen\nof Iran. She currently attends an Iranian university where she lives off-campus.\nApplicant has visited his stepsister about six times since 2000. Since his stepsister and\nstepmother live together in the house his stepmother owns, Applicant has telephone\ncontact with them about four times a year. Applicant will inherit nothing from his\nstepmother. The pension of Applicant\u2019s father goes to his stepsister. \nApplicant\u2019s father-in-law and mother-in-law (SOR 1.b.) were born and are\nresident citizens of Iran. His father-in-law is 77, and his mother-in-law is 62. His father-\nin-law was an accountant for an Iranian city, and has been retired for 20 years. He is in\npoor mental health. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law has always been in a homemaker. His\nparents-in-law own their own apartment. \nApplicant\u2019s sister-in-law (SOR 1.d.) was born and is a resident citizen of Iran.\nShe is 38 years old, married, and lives in the same building with Applicant\u2019s parents-in-\nlaw. Applicant has contacted his parents-in-law and sister-in-law through visits in 2004,\n2005 and 2007. He sporadically speaks to his sister-in-law when his wife contacts her\nby phone. Neither Applicant nor his wife has provided financial support to either side of\nhis family. \nApplicant traveled to Iran (SOR 1.c.) on six occasions between 2000 and April\n2007. He did not travel before 2000 because he could have been conscripted to serve\nin the military. He also stated, \u201cMy employer does allow for 3 or 4 weeks vacation all\ntaken at once.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s stepfather was born and is a citizen of the U.S. In addition to\nApplicant and his sister, the stepfather has two children of his own who were born in the\nU.S. \nForeign Preference\nApplicant\u2019s first Iranian passport expired in 1984. He renewed his Iranian\npassport in 1999 to prepare for his travel to the country in 2000. As noted earlier, he did\nnot travel to Iran before 2000 because he did not want to be drafted into the military.\nThe Iranian government allows Iranian born citizens to enter the country on an Iranian\n\n The record is unclear when Applicant first received his US. passport, but he renewed it in 2000. (Tr. 39) \n2\n The document is entitled \u201cDESTRUCTION OF PASSPORT.\u201d Yet, there is not indication the Iranian passport\n3\nwas destroyed. \n4\npassport only. On the six occasions Applicant traveled to Iran, he used his Iranian\npassport to enter the country, and his U.S. passport  to leave. He renewed his Iranian\n2\npassport in August 2004, and used it in April 2005 and March 2006. In his June 2007\nsworn statement explaining the circumstances under which he would not surrender his\nIranian passport, Applicant first stated:\nI am willing to destroy, surrender, or invalidate my Iranian passport, in\norder to obtain a security clearance with the U.S. Government.\nUnfortunately, I cannot relinquish my Iranian passport to the Iranian\ngovernment because they will not accept it. However, there is a possibility\nthat I might travel back to Iran in the future. I have family that are both\ncitizens and residents of Iran. If this should ever happen, I would\nrelinquish my security clearance, quit my job, and look for another position\nthat does not require a security clearance. (GE 2)\nIn explanation of his GE 2 statement about turning in his security clearance,\nApplicant testified that should a time emerge when the government of Iran becomes\nmore friendly to the U.S. than currently, then he might return to the country. (Tr. 65) The\nonly way he will travel back to Iran is to surrender his security clearance and then travel\nback to Iran. (Tr. 65-67)\nApplicant\u2019s security manager testified that he did not witness the surrender of\nApplicant\u2019s passport. See, AE A  The only matter he could testify to was that Applicant\u2019s\n3\npassport was locked up in a file cabinet. The security manager explained that if\nApplicant transferred to an unclassified job, the passport would be returned to him; if\nApplicant transferred to a classified position, then security would annotate the transfer in\nthe government record. \nSince becoming an American citizen, Applicant has had no contact with the\nIranian government except to renew his Iranian passport. He has never held political\noffice or voted in a foreign election. He has never received foreign education benefits,\nunemployment, medical benefits, or a pension. During his trips to Iran, Applicant has\nnever been stopped or detained by Iranian authorities.\nHe has never made any lasting contacts with Iranians. He has never visited the\nIranian diplomatic buildings while in Iran. He has never been involved in any activity that\nwould lead to pressure being placed on him. Applicant has no financial interests or\nproperty in Iran. If anyone tried to influence or coerce him, he would report the attempt\nto the appropriate authorities. \n\n This marriage was actually the stepfather\u2019s second marriage. He had two children from his first marriage.\n4\n Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - 2006 Iran, U.S. Department of State, bureau of Democracy,\n5\nHuman Rights and Labor, dated March 6, 2007.\n Travel Warning: Iran, U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Consular Affairs, dated January 3, 2008.\n6\n Background Note: Iran, U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, dated June 2007.\n7\n Country Reports on Terrorism2006, Chapter 3 - State Sponsors of Terrorism overview, U.S. Department of\n8\nState, Office of the Coordinator for Counterterrorism, dated April 30, 2007; Making America Safer by Defeating\nExtremists in the Middle east, State by President of the United States, released by the Office of the W hite\nHouse Press Secretary, August 28, 2007; Annual threat Assessment for the Senate Select Committee on\nIntelligence, Director of National Intelligence, February 5, 2008.\n5\nApplicant has reported all his trips to his security department. He also reported\nhis marriage to an Iranian citizen to his facility security officer (FSO). The FSO could not\nsay for certain that Applicant told him of the marriage, but concluded that the marriage\nwas the reason for the premature reinvestigation. According to the security manager,\nApplicant has never had a security violation. \nCharacter Evidence\nApplicant\u2019s performance rating for 2007 was \u201c4,\" defined as \u201csuperior\nperformance that frequently exceeds what is expected.\u201d Applicant\u2019s retirement savings\naccount (AE C) at the end of March 2008 was approximately $199,000.00.\nApplicant\u2019s stepfather (U.S. citizen) married  Applicant\u2019s mother in 1977 while\n4\nworking as an executive for a U.S. defense contractor. After grade school, the\nstepfather\u2019s relationship with Applicant has been intermittent because of work\nassignments in different parts of the world for extended periods of time. The stepfather\nbelieves Applicant to be honest. Applicant\u2019s sister (who emigrated to the U.S. with\nApplicant 30 years ago) lives about 40 miles away, and the stepfather intends to spend\nsome time with her. \nAdministrative Notice\nSince the Muslim clergy came to power in the early 1980s, the Islamic Republic\nof Iran has fostered a poor human rights record through repression of its people  as well\n5\nas through mistreatment of U.S.-Iranian dual citizens.  The Iranian government has\n6\npursued weapons of mass destruction  and supported terrorist activities throughout the\n7\nMiddle East.  Applicant is aware of the troubling practices of the Iranian government\n8\nboth inside and outside the government. (Tr. 65) \nPolicies\n\n6\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are flexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of human\nbehavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s ultimate adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial and common sense decision. According to the AG, the entire process is a\ncareful, thorough evaluation of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person\nconcept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2b.\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\nis not restricted to normal duty hours. Rather, the relationship is an-around-the-clock\nresponsibility between an applicant and the federal government. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nForeign Influence (FI)\nThe security issues connected to foreign influence are familial ties, contacts,\nand/or proprietary/financial interests that could be used to generate a heightened risk or\na potential conflict of interest by forcing an applicant into a position of having to choose\nbetween the foreign entity and the U.S. \n\n7\nForeign Preference (FP)\nActing in a way that shows that an individual has a tangible preference for a\nforeign country over the U.S. \nAnalysis\nForeign Influence (FI) \n6. The Concern. \u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target U.S.\ncitizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d\nThe government has established a preliminary basis for denying Applicant\u2019s\nsecurity clearance application. Applicant\u2019s stepmother, stepsister, father-in-law, mother-\nin-law, and sister-in-law are resident citizens of Iran. While Applicant\u2019s wife is still a\ncitizen of the country, she has not been a resident for more than three years. The\ncircumstances raise security concerns under the FI guideline because it makes\nApplicant potentially vulnerable to coercion and pressure. Foreign Influence (FI)\ndisqualifying condition (DC) 7.a. (contact with a foreign family member, business or\nprofessional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or a resident in a\nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion) applies. The risk of Applicant\u2019s\nvulnerability to pressure and influence is heightened by the enmity that the Iranian\ngovernment holds for U.S. interests. Though the DOHA Appeal Board has stated there\nis no pro se rule regarding any foreign country, the policies and practices of the Iranian\ngovernment impose a heavy burden on an applicant to demonstrate he warrants a\nsecurity clearance. See, ISCR Case No. 01-26983 (October 16, 2002) \nApplicant\u2019s contacts with his stepmother and stepsister since 1977 have been\nperiodic. He maintains telephone contact with them about 3 or 4 times a year. Between\n2000 and April 2007, Applicant traveled to Iran six times to see both family members.\nApplicant\u2019s contacts with his stepmother and stepsister have existed for 30 years\nwithout any interference of the Iranian government. Even though it is impossible to say\nwith certainty what is likely to happen in future, the absence of manipulation by the\nIranian government against his stepmother and stepsister for 30 years is credible\nevidence that the chances of exploitation being exerted upon and through them in the\nfuture is low. Due to the sporadic nature of Applicant\u2019s contacts with his father-in-law,\nmother-in-law, and sister-in-law, the chances of the Iranian government trying to reach\nApplicant through them must be assessed as numerically greater, but overall still very\nlow.  \n\n8\nFI DC 7.b. (connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect\nsensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person,\ngroup, or country by providing that information), and FI DC 7.d. (sharing living quarters\nwith a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a\nheightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion) apply even\nthough FI DC 7.a., FI DC 7.b., and FI DC 7.d. overlap considerably in their reach. The\npotential for conflict and the heightened risk for foreign influence is triggered by\nApplicant\u2019s relatives who are resident citizens of a foreign country. As noted there is a\nheightened risk that is assuaged by Applicant\u2019s credible statements and testimony that\nhe would resist and report any foreign influence to the appropriate authorities. \nFI DC 7.d. applies based on fact that Applicant\u2019s wife moving with Applicant in\nMay 2005 and becoming his wife. Though she is an Iranian citizen, she intends to\nbecome a U.S. citizen, and is on track to receive her permanent resident visa. \nThree of the six mitigating conditions (MC) under the FI guideline may apply to\nthe facts and circumstances of this case: \nFC MC 8.a. (the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the\ncountry in which these persons are located, or the position or activities of\nthose persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will\nbe placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a\nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of\nthe U.S.); \nFI MC 8.b. (there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s\nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or\ncountry is minimal, or the individual has such deep and long lasting\nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected\nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest);\n FI MC 8.c. (contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual\nand infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for\nforeign influence or exploitation).\nEven though Applicant\u2019s spouse, stepmother, stepsister, father-in-law, and sister-\nin-law, are resident citizens of Iran, only two of Applicant\u2019s family members worked for a\ncity government in Iran. Applicant\u2019s stepmother and father-in-law worked as\naccountants for a city in Iran. Applicant\u2019s stepmother is retired and his father-in-law has\nbeen retired for 20 years. He is in poor mental health. None of the other family members\nhave ever been employed by or agents of the Iranian government. Because there is no\nevidence that Applicant\u2019s family members have ever been targeted or exploited by the\nIranian government to reach him in 30 years, the chances of the Iranian government\npressuring him through his relatives in the future are low. Applicant has been working\nfor defense contractors since 1985, and has held a security clearance for about eight\n\n9\nyears with his current employer. While he admittedly has a close relationship with his\nstepmother and stepsister, he has successfully convinced me that his sense of\nresponsibility to both the U.S. and his employer means he will successfully work through\nany conflict in favor of the U.S. FI MC 8.a. FI MC 8.b. resolves SOR 1.a., and 1.b. in\nApplicant\u2019s favor. I find for Applicant under SOR 1.c. Even though some of the trips\nwere up to a month in duration, thereby exposing Applicant to exploitation and duress, I\nconclude the allegation in Applicant\u2019s favor for the same reasons that I have found the\nother two allegations in his favor. \nFI MC 8.c. is inapplicable to this case. Evidence that an applicant has contacts\nwith an immediate family member in a foreign country raises a rebuttable presumption\nthe contacts are not casual in nature. ISCR Case No. 00-0484 at 5, (App. Bd. Feb. 1,\n2002) Applicant\u2019s contacts with his listed family members are periodic rather than\nsporadic or nonexistent. Hence, the contact or communication cannot be considered\ncasual and infrequent. \nForeign Preference (FP)\n9. The Concern. \u201cWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for\na foreign country over the U.S., then he or she may be prone to provide information or\nmake decision that are harmful to the interests of the U.S.\u201d\nApplicant renewed his Iranian passport in 1999 and 2004, and used the passport\nto enter Iran on seven occasions between 2000 and April 2007. The renewal and use\ncame after he received his U.S. citizenship in 1985. FP DC 10.a.1. (Exercise of any\nright, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or\nthrough the foreign citizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: 1.\npossession of a current passport) applies. \nApplicant\u2019s view toward keeping his Iranian passport has evolved since he\nprovided his sworn statement in June 2007. Though he seemed initially reluctant to turn\nover his Iranian passport, he has successfully persuaded me he understands that\npursuant to the mitigating condition of the Directive, the Iranian passport must be\ndestroyed or otherwise invalidated because it is incompatible with possession of a\nsecurity clearance.\nApplicant\u2019s honesty in having hopes that relations between Iran and the U.S.\nimprove to a level where he can travel to the country does not show an impermissible\nemotional attachment (preference) for Iran that automatically disqualifies him under the\nFP guideline, especially with the significant evidence of Applicant\u2019s developing ties to\nthe U.S. since his arrival in 1977.\nWhile Applicant renewed his Iranian passport two times, and used it several\ntimes after receiving his U.S. citizenship in 1985, his conduct must be viewed in the\ncontext that he was not aware that his continued use of the Iranian passport was\nsecurity disqualifying. His reluctance to surrender his Iranian passport because of the\n\n10\npolices of the Iranian immigration service, must also be weighed in understanding his\nconduct. Having expressed a preference solely for the U.S. during the security\ninvestigation and at the hearing, and having found his testimony credible, Applicant has\ndemonstrated by his actions that his sole preference is for the U.S. In conclusion, FP\nMC 11.e. (the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security\nauthority, or otherwise invalidated) applies to find the FP guideline in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \nWhole Person Concept (WPC)\nMy finding for Applicant under the FI and FP guidelines must still be evaluated in\nthe context of nine variables known as the whole person concept. In evaluating the\nrelevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the administrative judge should consider the\nfollowing factors: (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the\nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time\nof the conduct; (5) the extent to which the participation was voluntary; (6) the presence\nor absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9)\nthe likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nApplicant came to the U.S. in 1977 with his stepfather, mother and sister. In\n1984, he received his Bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering. In 1985 he was\nnaturalized as a U.S. citizen. For the next 13 years, he worked for defense contractors.\nIn August 1998, he began working for his current employer as a network\nadministrator/engineer, and received a security clearance. He officially briefed his\nsecurity office of his trips to Iran. I also believe he told them of his pending marriage to\nan Iranian citizen in May 2005. While he has six family members who are citizens of\nIran, his wife has been living with him in the U.S. since May 2005, and intends to\nbecome a U.S. citizen. His mother and sister are naturalized U.S citizens. Applicant has\nno property or financial interests in Iran, but he has saved about $200,000.00 in stocks\nand other financial instruments in his U.S. retirement savings account. He and his wife\nhave a two-year-old child and are expecting a second child in the near future.\nConsidering the whole person with the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, I find\nApplicant has satisfied his heavy burden of persuasion under the FI and FP guidelines. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1 (Foreign Influence, Guideline B):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b.\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c.\nFor Applicant\n\n11\nParagraph 2 (Foreign Preference, Guideline C): FOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a. \nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b.\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n                       \nPaul J. Mason\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance is denied. \n \nOn June 20, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nto Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuidelines E and J.1 The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \n1 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on August 1, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on September \n \n1 The SOR has a mark striking \u201cISCR\u201d and replacing it with \u201cADP.\u201d Department Counsel \nconfirmed the case is an ISCR. \nNovember 28, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \n23, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on September 29, 2008, and I convened the \nhearing as scheduled on October 28, 2008. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 4. Applicant did not object and they were admitted. The government also \noffered GE 5, which was marked for identification and was used to refresh Applicant\u2019s \nrecollection, but was not admitted. An additional exhibit was marked as Hearing Exhibit \n(HE) I. Applicant and three witnesses testified. Applicant submitted Exhibits (AE) A-B. \nDepartment Counsel did not object and they were admitted. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on November 6, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant denied the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 32 years old and works as an information technology \ntechnician/project manager for a defense contractor. He graduated from high school in \n1994. He served in the Marines for six years and was honorably discharged at the rank \nof sergeant. He earned an associate\u2019s degree and has approximately 16 credits \nremaining to complete a bachelor\u2019s degree. He is engaged to be married.  \n \nOn December 21, 1996, Applicant was charged with Driving Under the Influence \nof Alcohol.2 On about September 17, 1997, the court granted Applicant Probation \nBefore Judgment, and he was required to pay a fine of approximately $255, \nsuccessfully complete an alcohol counseling session and was placed on probation for \n18 months.  \n \n \nOn July 12, 1997, Applicant was arrested and charged with (1) DUI with a Blood \nAlcohol Content of .10% or above, and (2) Violation of Provisional License Restriction. \nOn about November 13, 1997, Applicant was found guilty of DUI, fined approximately \n$1,000, with $800 suspended, plus $20 court cost, his driver\u2019s license was suspended, \nand he was placed on supervised probation for three years. Count (2) was nolle \nprossed. Applicant was ordered to attend a 26-week Problem Drinkers Program and \nAlcohol Anonymous Meetings for about six months. On September 29, 1998, the state \nmedical advisory board imposed an alcohol restriction on Applicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license, \nand it was still in effect in 2003.  \n \n \nOn December 13, 2002, Applicant was charged with 4th Degree Burglary. He was \nintoxicated at the time he was arrested. The charge was subsequently nolle prossed.  \n \n \n2 The actual charge was \u201cDriving While Intoxicated.\u201d Both \u201cDriving While Intoxicated\u201d and \u201cDriving \nUnder the Influence\u201d are essentially the same offense, but are referred to differently depending on the \njurisdiction. To eliminate confusion they both will be referred to as DUI. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant testified he has been arrested three times, twice for DUI and once for \nburglary.3 He claimed that when he was interviewed for his first security clearance he \nrevealed his three arrests.4 \n \nIn a sworn statement provided to a special agent of the Defense Security Agency \non September 15, 2003, Applicant stated he had been arrested in December 2002 for \n4th Degree Burglary and had twice been arrested for DUI sometime in 1995 or 1996. In \nthis statement Applicant stated:  \n \nWhen I completed my security forms, I neglected to list both of my \noffenses. I thought that the DUI offense for which I received Probation \nBefore Judgment had been expunged from my record, and I therefore was \nnot required to list i[t] on my security forms. I made no attempt to \nintentionally withhold information or to falsify my forms. I thought that I had \ntruthfully and accurately answered all questions.5  \n \nApplicant was asked \u201cwhy didn\u2019t you disclose the other offense on your security \nform in 2003\u201d He responded, \u201cI don\u2019t recall any information regarding that. I mean, I \ndon\u2019t know.\u201d6 Applicant claimed he listed his other two offenses on his 2003 SCA.7  \n \nApplicant testified that after he completed the SCA in 2003 he received a Top \nSecret clearance through the Department of State. In 2005, he was given interim \naccess to sensitive compartmented information (SCI). Later he was working as a \ncontractor for an agency that required a polygraph and an updated background check. \nHe was required to complete another SCA for access to SCI. He stated he was given \nvery little time to complete the forms.8 \n \n \nApplicant completed another SCA and signed it on November 21, 2006. In that \nSCA Question 23 asked him about his police record and if he had \u201cever been charged \nwith or convicted of any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs,\u201d to which he answered \n \n3 Tr. 98. \n \n4 Tr. 99. \n \n5 GE2 at 5. I have not considered for disqualifying purposes the fact that Applicant failed to \ndivulge his criminal conduct on his 2003 security application, but will consider it in the whole person \nanalysis and to analyze a pattern, credibility, honest mistake, and a course of conduct. Conduct not \nalleged in the SOR may be considered: \u201c(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an \napplicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the \nAdjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (citations omitted). \n \n6 Tr. 121. \n \n7 The 2003 Security Application was not provided by either party. \n \n8 Tr. 95-98. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \n\u201cno.\u201d Question 26 asked him if he had \u201cever had a clearance or access authorization \ndenied, suspended, or revoked,\u201d to which he answered \u201cno.\u201d  \n \nApplicant was interviewed twice by an OPM investigator in 2007, but could not \nrecall the specifics of the interview.9 He could not recall if he told the investigator that \nhis security manager had told him that his SCI had been revoked.  \n \n \nApplicant completed a signed, sworn statement dated February 11, 2008. In that \nstatement Applicant stated he had been arrested on two occasions in his life, one arrest \nin 1996 for DUI, and one arrest in 2001 for 4th Degree Burglary. This statement is not \ntrue. Applicant was arrested twice for DUI and once for Burglary. \n \n \nIn a sworn affidavit of February 11, 2008, provided to a Special Agent for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM), Applicant stated:10  \n \nAs I have always fully divulged during prior background investigations, I \nhave been arrested on two occasions over the course of my life. The first \narrest came in 1996 (exact date unrecalled). I was arrested in City B by \nCity B police for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI).11  \n \n* * * \n \nMy other arrest occurred in 2001 (exact date unrecalled), and also \noccurred in City B.12  \n \n* * * \n \nAside from my aforementioned 1996 DUI arrest and 2001 arrest for \nburglary, I have never been questioned, detained, or arrested by any law \nenforcement body. Aside from my 1996 DUI arrest, I have never been \ncharged or convicted of any offenses related to alcohol, regardless of \nwhether they have been expunged, sealed, or stricken from court records. \nThere will be no arrest or court records found that will allude to me being \ninvolved in any other criminal-related acts other than the two I have \nalready discussed.13 \n \n* * * \n \n9 Tr. 125. \n \n10 GE 3. \n \n11 Id. at 3. \n \n12 This was the 4th degree burglary arrest. \n \n13 GE 3. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nAside from my 1996 court-mandated alcohol counseling, I have never \nbeen counseled or medically treated for alcohol abuse or misuse.14  \n \n* * * \n \nDespite my affirmation immediately above about full disclosure of my \ncriminal past, it was brought to my attention during my interview with the \nOPM Investigator that I did not admit to any arrests on my most recently \nsubmitted Standard Form 86 (SF86). I was unable to offer a response as \nto why I failed to list these arrests on my SF86. However, as I explained to \nthe OPM Investigator, there is no way I would attempt to conceal my \narrest information because I fully divulged it to the Defense Security \nService (DSS) Investigator during my last background investigation which \noccurred in 2003. Additionally, I could not offer reasons why I failed to list \nthe fact that I had my TS/SCI security clearance revoked on my SF86. \nDespite not being able to provide said reasoning, I affirmed during my \ninterview that I was not attempting to withhold or conceal a material fact.15 \n \n \nThroughout his statement of February 11, 2008, Applicant refers to his TS/SCI \nclearance as being \u201crevoked.\u201d He stated:  \n \nUpon being read-off the contract, I was allowed to stay employed with \u2026. \nHowever, since my TS/SCI clearance was revoked, which limited my \ncapabilities and usefulness at work, I began to seek employment \nelsewhere.16  \n \n\u2022 * * \n\u2022  \n [T]o present day, I have never been told why my clearance was revoked.  \n \n* * * \n \nThe \u2026representatives informed me that there were inconsistencies in my \npolygraph examination responses which specifically pertained to my past \ncriminal history. I have no idea why this was the case. I have been \npreviously arrested on two occasions, and I fully divulged that to the \u2026 \nduring the polygraph examination.17  \n \nApplicant refers to only two arrests that he divulged.  \n \n14 Id. \n \n15 Id. \n \n16 Id. \n \n17 Id. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant testified that he was interviewed twice in 2007. After the last interview \nthe investigator prepared a written statement and he met with the investigator to go over \nthe statement in February 2008. Applicant confirmed that he was provided the written \nstatement that was prepared by the investigator; he had an opportunity to read it and \nmake corrections. Applicant testified: \n \nI did notice that the \u201997 arrest was missing, but I figured, you now, the \ninvestigator, you know, had that information, you know, in the two-week \ntime period would have brought it up and certainly asked questions about \nit. I asked the investigator, \u2018is this, you know, the last time we\u2019re going to \nhave to talk about this?\u2019 He said, \u2018Yes, you\u2019ll probably never see me again, \nand you probably won\u2019t have to worry about this for five years.\u201d So, I \nsigned the paperwork and I have not seen him again.18  \n \nI explained everything, you know, to the investigator. You know, we looked \nover everything. You know, I\u2019ve already explained everything in the past \nbefore, so, why\u2013why it isn\u2019t on there, you know, I don\u2019t know.19  \n \nApplicant stated he did not intentionally omit the pertinent information and he did \nnot fail to discuss all of his arrests to the investigator. He further stated: \u201cI thought it was \nan update and I didn\u2019t need to.\u201d20 Applicant was asked if he knew when he read the \nstatement that it was not \u201ctotally correct\u201d and he admitted he was aware it was not. He \nadmitted that when he signed it he knew there were mistakes in the statement.21 He \nwas asked why he did not correct them. He stated:  \n \nWell, the investigator had it for two years\u2014I mean, I mean two months\u2014or \ntwo weeks. I figured if he had any problems with it he would have \naddressed it at the time. And this is all information that was already \nrevealed in 2003.22  \n \nHe stated: \u201cI know it isn\u2019t in there, and I didn\u2019t read it thoroughly enough and I wish that I \nhad.\u201d23 He confirmed that he initialed grammatical changes made by the investigator but \nnot substantive matters.  \n \n \n18 Tr. 103. \n \n19 Tr. 105-106. \n \n20 Tr. 99. \n \n21 Tr. 135-136. \n \n22 Id. \n \n23 Tr. 153-155. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \nRegarding Applicant\u2019s failure to divulge the revocation of TS/SCI access, he \nstated he had not received a \u201cformal letter or reasoning\u201d for being read-off the \ngovernment contract. He stated: \n \nYou know, when I met with the investigator, you know, he and I spoke \nabout that and the investigator brought up the term, you know, \u2018revoked.\u2019 \nSo I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s been revoked. I don\u2019t know if it was downgrade[d].24  \n \nHe stated that it was never explained to him what \u201crevoked\u201d meant. When asked what \nhis understanding of the word \u201crevoked\u201d was, he stated \u201ctaken away\u2026 or to tell you the \ntruth, I really don\u2019t have a full understanding of that word.\u201d25 After further questioning he \nstated he did not know a \u201cWebster\u2019s version, you know of the\u2026not a Webster\u2019s \nDictionary version,\u201d26 but then stated it meant \u201cto be taken away.\u201d27  \n \nApplicant admitted that when he worked for a different defense contractor he was \ntold by his facilities security officer that he was being read-off the contract because he \ndid not pass the polygraph. He understood that he did not have access to SCI. He \nunderstood that a decision was made that he was not going to have access to SCI. \nApplicant was concerned because \u201cI never received any reasons for that.\u201d28 \n \n \nI find Applicant\u2019s testimony throughout the proceeding was not credible or \nbelievable. I find he was evasive and lacked candor. His explanations regarding his \nomissions on his SCA were not believable. His testimony as to why he failed to list his \nrevocation of his TS/SCI security clearance was not believable. He was aware his \nTS/SCI security clearance had been revoked and deliberately omitted it on his SCA. \nEven if he were to be believed that he was in a hurry when he completed his SCA in \n2006, when he was interviewed later he failed to ensure the investigator had all of his \ncorrect information. In his written statement of February 11, 2008, he had an opportunity \nto correct the omissions and mistakes and he intentionally and deliberately chose not \ntoo. He repeatedly provided conflicting statements that contradicted sworn statements \npreviously made. \n \n \nThree witnesses testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf and a character letter was \nprovided. One a former coworkers/friend considers Applicant an excellent worker, who \nis reliable and dependable. He and Applicant lived together for a period of time and \nsocialized. He did not notice any alcohol-related issues during this time. He believes \n \n24 Tr. 109, 150-151. Apparently Applicant was interviewed twice by the OPM investigator, once \nregarding his criminal activity and another time regarding his SCI revocation. \n \n25 Tr. 111. \n \n26 Id. \n \n27 Id. \n \n28 Tr. 132-133, 144. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant is thorough and not forgetful.29 The other considers Applicant an honorable \nperson that he trusts and respects. Both recommend he be granted a security \nclearance.30 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9 testified that she believes Applicant is truthful and he made a \nmistake. She believed he forgot to divulge the omitted information and did not \nunderstand the questions and thought he only had to go back five years. She \nrecommends Applicant for a position of trust.31 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor testified on his behalf. The supervisor received positive \nfeedback from customers about Applicant. He trusts Applicant and recommended that \nhe be given a security clearance.32  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \n \n29 Tr. 29-51. \n \n30 AE B. \n \n31 Tr. 55-74. \n \n32 Tr.78-90. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct. \u201cConduct \ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any \nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or \nany other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\u201d  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have specifically considered (a) (\u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or \nfalsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities\u201d); and (b) (\u201cdeliberately providing \nfalse or misleading information concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity \nofficial, \ncompetent \nmedical \nauthority, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative\u201d) under this guideline. I have considered all of the facts and find \nApplicant deliberately omitted, concealed, misled, and falsified information on his \nSeptember 2006 SCA, on his signed sworn statement of February 11, 2008, and at this \nhearing. I find he deliberately failed to divulge all of his criminal conduct and the \nrevocation of his TS/SCI security clearance by another government agency. I find in his \nsigned sworn statement of February 11, 2008, he deliberately failed to disclose he had \nbeen arrested twice for DUI. I find both disqualifying conditions apply. \n\n \n10 \n \n \n                                                          \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions and especially considered AG \u00b6 17(a) (\u201cthe individual made prompt, good-\nfaith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being \nconfronted with the facts\u201d); (b) (\u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or \nthe behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment\u201d); and (e) (\u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to reduce or \neliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress\u201d). Applicant did not make \nan effort to correct the omissions and falsifications on his SCA or in his February 11, \n2008, sworn statement. To the contrary, he was aware of mistakes in his sworn \nstatement, had an opportunity to correct them and did not act to do so. Applicant did not \ndivulge all of his criminal conduct in his first SCA.33 When he was interviewed in 2003, \nhe provided an explanation for why he failed to divulge all of his criminal conduct. Later \nhe stated he relied on previous admissions of his conduct to supplement his 2006 SCA. \nHowever, he provided different reasons why he did not fully divulge all of the information \nwhen he completed his 2006 SCA, and, when he was later interviewed and signed and \nswore to his statement. His explanations were: He believed it was an update and the \ninformation was already available; he was in a hurry; he did not understand what \n\u201crevoked\u201d meant; he forgot; he assumed the investigator chose not to address one of \nhis DUI convictions when he transcribed the statement. Based on his numerous \nexplanations, I find Applicant\u2019s actions were not the result of an honest mistake, but \nwere deliberate. He perpetrated a falsification and continued his affirmation of it \nthroughout his hearing. Applicant\u2019s actions can not be considered minor because he \nfailed to divulge information that was pertinent to his security clearance investigation at \nvarious stages throughout the process, thereby casting doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness and good judgment. Applicant\u2019s testimony was unreliable and untruthful. \nI find insufficient evidence was presented to confirm he has taken steps to reduce his \nvulnerability. I find none of the mitigating conditions apply. \nCriminal Conduct \n \nAG\u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct: ACriminal \nactivity creates doubt about a person=s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its \nvery nature, it calls into question a person=s ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules and regulations.@ \n \nThe SOR cross-alleges Applicant\u2019s falsifications regarding his failure to fully \ndivulge his criminal conduct, his security clearance revocation and statements in his \nFebruary 11, 2008, signed sworn statement. I previously found his falsifications and \nomissions were deliberate and intentional. I have considered the disqualifying \nconditions under Criminal Conduct AG \u00b6 31 (a) (\u201ca single serious crime or multiple \n \n33 I have not considered for disqualifying purposes any possible omissions made in his 2003 SCA \nor statement. However, I have considered them, as stated above, when analyzing the whole person or as \na course of conduct, including analysis of a deliberate falsification or a mistake.  \n\n \n11 \n \n \n                                                          \nlesser offenses\u201d), and (c) (\u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted\u201d). \n \nIt is a felony, punishable by a fine or imprisonment for not more than five years or \nboth, to knowingly and willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent \nstatement or representation in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive branch \nof the government of the United States.34 Security clearances are matters within the \njurisdiction of the executive branch of the government of the United States. A \ndeliberately false answer on a security clearance application is a serious crime within \nthe meaning of Guideline J. Applicant\u2019s false answers on his security clearance \napplication and signed sworn statement raise disqualifying conditions (a) and (c). \n \n \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for criminal conduct and \nespecially considered AG \u00b6 32 (a) (\u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal \nbehavior happened, or it happened under unusual circumstances that is it unlikely to \nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness or good \njudgment\u201d), and (d) (\u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not \nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive \ncommunity involvement\u201d). Appellant provided incomplete and false information \nthroughout the course of the security investigation and at his hearing. For example, \nwhen confronted with the inconsistencies regarding why he did not list the revocation of \nhis security clearance and access to SCI, he elaborated that he never received formal \nnotification; he did not know what the word \u201crevoked\u201d meant; and he did not know the \nWebster\u2019s definition of it. When directly confronted, he admitted it meant \u201ctaken away.\u201d \nHis actions did not happen under unusual circumstances, and consequently they do \ncast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. Due to Applicant\u2019s \ncontinuing conduct and lack of credibility during his testimony, I find there is insufficient \nevidence of successful rehabilitation. I find none of the mitigating conditions apply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \n \n34 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.  \n\n \n12 \n \n \nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a 32-year-old man who \nis a valued dependable worker. He has served his country for six years as a Marine. He \nfailed to be completely honest and provide a complete picture of his criminal history and \nthat he previously had his security clearance and access to SCI revoked. He had \nopportunities to correct the omissions, but did not. Even if he were to believed that he \nhad listed everything on his 2003 SCA regarding his criminal conduct, his statement of \nFebruary 11, 2008, clearly asserts he was arrested only twice, which was false. He \nfailed to provide a credible explanation why he did not list his security clearance \nrevocation. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts \nas to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, \nI conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from personal \nconduct and criminal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances it is not clearly consistent with national security \nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

I\nreceived the case assignment on May 19, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nMay 22, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on June 10, 2008. During the\nhearing, I received four government exhibits and Applicant\u2019s testimony. DOHA received\nthe hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 18, 2008. Based upon a review of the record\nevidence, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s application for a security clearance must be\ndenied.\nJuly 30, 2008\n\nThe girlfriend was the woman he later married. He characterized their relationship through the 1990s as \u201con\n1\nagain, off again\u201d (Tr. 35).\n2\n \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 42-year-old, single man with three children ages nineteen, nine, an\neight. He has been married once, previously. It ended in divorce in 2003. Currently he\nlives with his girlfriend and his nine-year-old son. He has had custody of his son for two\nyears (Tr. 15). He is actively involved with his family, volunteering as a coach for his\nson\u2019s YMCA football team (Tr. 38). For the past two years, he has worked for a\ncontractor that manufactures night vision goggles.\nIn June 1989, Applicant was arrested and charged with assault after a domestic\nviolence incident with his then girlfriend. Approximately five months later, the charge\nwas dismissed.\nIn July 1997, Applicant was arrested and charged with property damage and\ndomestic assault after another incident involving his then-girlfriend.  He was found guilty\n1\nof the domestic assault charge, and the court dismissed the property damage charge.\nIn November 1997, Applicant was charged with domestic assault. The charge\nwas later dismissed. Applicant and his then girlfriend were ordered to attend anger\nmanagement classes after each of the domestic incidents (Tr. 42).\nIn January 2007, Applicant was charged with assault and battery - family\nmember. The charges stemmed from an argument his current girlfriend initiated in the\nmorning while he was in the process of getting his son ready to go to daycare. As\nApplicant prepared to leave with his son, his girlfriend blocked the door. Applicant then\ncalled 911. The girlfriend moved from the doorway before the police arrived, and\nApplicant left with his son. Before leaving, he told the 911 operator that police\nassistance was unnecessary. \nWhile Applicant was dropping off his son, his girlfriend contacted the police, and\nsought a restraining order (Tr. 17). When Applicant returned home, a policeman arrived,\nserved him with the restraining order, charged him with assault and battery, and\narrested him (Tr. 22). He was not handcuffed and he was not \u201cread his rights\u201d (Tr. 19).\nAt a subsequent hearing, the court nolle prossed the charge.\nIn June 2007, Applicant completed a security clearance application. Question 23\nrequired him to list any arrests, charges or convictions that had occurred within seven\nyears of completing the application. He did not disclose the January 2007 incident. At\nthe hearing, he stated he did not list it because he did not think he was actually arrested\n(Tr. 19). Later during the hearing, he explained that he omitted it because \u201cit was\nthrowed [sic] out of court\u201d (Tr. 20). He understood that he was facing charges when he\nwent to court (Tr. 23). \n\n3\n \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, they are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in\nthe adjudicative process. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present\nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15,\nthe Applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department\nCounsel. . . .\u201d The Applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a\nfavorable security decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d \nAnalysis\nApplicant\u2019s conduct raises criminal and personal conduct security concerns under\nAdjudicative Guidelines J and E. \u201cCriiminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s\njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness,\u201d and by its very nature raises questions about\na person\u2019s willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations (AG \u00b6 30). Under\nGuideline E, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information\u201d (AG \u00b6\n15).\nApplicant\u2019s domestic violence-related arrests trigger the application of AG \u00b6\n31(a), \u201ca single serious crime, or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d None were serious, and only\none occurred in the last 10 years. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s role as a stabilizing influence in\nhis son\u2019s life, whom he is raising and maintains custody, is evidence of rehabilitation.\nNevertheless, I conclude that none of the criminal conduct guideline\u2019s mitigating\nconditions apply. He omitted the most recent charge from his security clearance\napplication. His contradictory explanation leads me to conclude that he falsified the\napplication. This constitutes a felony under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001, and together with the four\nearlier domestic violence arrests represents an unacceptable pattern of criminal\nbehavior. Applicant has not mitigated the criminal conduct security concern.\n\nDeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\n2\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities.\n4\n \nThe intentional nature of Applicant\u2019s security clearance application omission also\ntriggers the application of AG \u00b6 16(a) of the Personal Conduct guideline.  For the\n2\nreasons set forth above, none of the corresponding mitigating conditions apply.\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. Considering this case in light of the\nwhole person concept, I conclude Applicant\u2019s criminal and personal conduct remain a\nsecurity concern. Clearance is denied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n5\n \nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \n_________________\nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant admitted the allegation in subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d of the SOR. He denied subparagraphs 2.a and 2.b. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 60 years old and works for a federal contractor in the information assurance field. He has had a secret clearance since approximately 1994. He is a recovering alcoholic.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance is denied. \n \nOn June 12, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nto Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuidelines H and E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on September 2, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on January 13, \n2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 22, 2009, and after coordinating the \ndate with both sides I convened the hearing as scheduled on February 3, 2009.

Applicant did not object and they were \nadmitted. Applicant also offered a post-hearing exhibit marked as AE A. Department \nCounsel had no objection and it was admitted. DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on February 10, 2009.  \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. \nApplicant admitted the allegation in subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d of the SOR. He \ndenied subparagraphs 2.a and 2.b. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is 60 years old and works for a federal contractor in the information \nassurance field. He has had a secret clearance since approximately 1994. He is a \nrecovering alcoholic. He is married and has three children. His youngest child, a son, \nnow 21 years old, was born with a serious congenital heart and pulmonary disease. He \nhas had many surgeries from the time he was born to the present. The disease he has \nhas a high mortality rate and Applicant never knew whether the next medical issue \nwould be debilitating or cause his son\u2019s death. Dealing with his son\u2019s illness was very \nstressful. Despite his illness, his son completed high school and is now in college.1   \n \nIn 2006, Applicant\u2019s son\u2019s health was deteriorating and he was becoming a \n\u201ccardiac cripple\u201d, unable to walk or climb stairs. The doctors gave him three medical \noptions, none of which were good. In desperation they agreed to an experimental \ncorrective heart surgery. During 2006 Applicant was experiencing a high level of stress \ndue to his son\u2019s health crises. In November 2006, his son had an experimental \noperation. The operation was successful, but Applicant also was confronted with the \nfact that his son was still sick and would never be normal or healthy. Applicant\u2019s son is \npresently stable, but he is not healthy.2  \n \nSome time before December 2006 Applicant\u2019s wife found marijuana and a pipe in \nthe purse of one of their daughter\u2019s friend\u2019s who was at their house. His wife took the \nmarijuana and placed it in a cabinet drawer in the master bathroom. Applicant was \naware it was in the cabinet and did not throw it out. He did not know why he did not \nthrow it out. He knows marijuana is illegal and he had no plans on returning the \nmarijuana to the owner. In December 2006 Applicant used the marijuana that was found \nin the purse several times to address the stress he was feeling. He did not contact his \nAlcoholic Anonymous (AA) sponsor. He held a security clearance at the time he used \nmarijuana.3 \n \n \n1 Tr. 9, 18-22. \n \n2 Tr. 22-27, 65-68. \n \n3 Tr. 27-32, 46. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \nIn March 2007 Applicant began completing his security clearance application on-\nline. He started it and then would stop and continue it at a later time after he had \ngathered the pertinent information for it. Between approximately April 15 and 21 2007, \nhe completed the application, but had not yet submitted it. He did not divulge his \nDecember 2006 drug usage.4  \n \nApplicant was attending a family baptism at the end of April 2007. He was not \nenjoying himself and left the event where his wife and children were and went home by \nhimself. He was depressed and did not think life was worth living. He wanted to feel \ngood and considered using alcohol but was afraid to use it. He understands from AA \nthat any mind-altering substance is prohibited and use of marijuana is a violation of \nsobriety. He again used some of the marijuana that was stored in his bathroom. He did \nnot have an explanation for why he kept the drugs in the house in the first place or after \nhe had used the marijuana in December 2006. He stated he did not know why he did \nnot get rid of it. He said: \u201cI don\u2019t know, maybe I wanted to keep it around.\u201d5 After his \nApril 2007 use he flushed the remainder of the marijuana down the toilet and threw the \npipe away. He held a security clearance when he used marijuana on this date.6 \n \nApplicant contacted his AA sponsor the next day and told him he was using \nmarijuana. He told his sponsor he wanted to get sober.  \n \nApplicant previously used marijuana from 1969 to 1970. He admitted this usage \nwhen applying for a secret security clearance in 1994. He stated on the questionnaire \n\u201cmarijuana-1969-1970 weekends. No intention to use\u2026.experimental and social use in \nlate 60\u2019s early 70\u2019s.\u201d 7  \n \nOn May 3, 2007, Applicant completed and submitted his SCA. He did not change \nhis answer on his SCA and intentionally failed to divulge his illegal uses of marijuana.8 \nHe did not put any comments on the form under \u201cadditional comments.\u201d He was \nspecifically asked if he knew when he certified and signed his SCA on May 3, 2007, that \nhe provided false answers about his drug use. He stated:  \n \nI did. I also knew that I was going to at that point in time, knew that there \nwas an investigation that followed and that\u2019s \u2013-I just didn\u2019t know that there \nwas enough writing in the world to explain what I was going to do on a \nform.9  \n \n4 Tr. 30-32. \n \n5 Tr. 53-55. \n \n6 Tr. 32-35, 48. \n \n7 Tr. 35, 47; GE 1. \n \n8 Tr. 49-50. \n \n9 Tr. 50. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \nApplicant did not request an interview. He waited until he was contacted by an \ninvestigator. 10 Applicant vacillated on the reasons why he did not change his answer \nand admit his drug use. In his interview with the Office of Personnel Management \n(OPM) investigator on June 13, 2007, he told her that he did not intentionally fail to \ndivulge his marijuana use, but rather forgot about the use in December 2006 and was in \na hurry to complete his security questionnaire. He also told the interviewer that he \nsubmitted his SCA prior to his April 29, 2007 use. He reiterated these responses on his \nsworn answer to the SOR on September 2, 2008. He stated: \u201cI was in a hurry to \ncomplete the questionnaire, forgot about the use in December, and had prepared my \nanswer before the April use.\u201d These statements are inconsistent with his hearing \ntestimony.11 At his hearing he stated that when he certified and signed the SCA he \nknew he was not divulging his drug use. He said \u201cI probably did not forget about my \nmarijuana use.\u201d He then stated: \u201cI knew I had used marijuana when I certified.\u201d When \nasked directly what his rationale was for lying on his SCA he stated: \u201c[A]t that point in \ntime I thought it would be better to just try to get it out in person.\u201d12 He testified he was \naware he was going to talk to an investigator, but doesn\u2019t know why he did not list his \ndrug use on the SCA. He also stated that he knew he was going to tell the investigator \nand he was not sure if he would have the opportunity to explain. He admitted he did not \ncontact the investigator prior to her interview with him. In June 2007 when he was \ninterviewed by the OPM investigator, he divulged his drug use when she was going over \nthe questions on his SCA. However, his explanation to the investigator for why he failed \nto divulge his drug use was inconsistent with his hearing testimony. On one hand he \nstated the reason he did not divulge it was because he wanted to tell the investigator \nand have an opportunity to explain. However, during his interview he told her the reason \nhe did not reveal the illegal drug use was because he forgot about the December 2006 \nuse and he had submitted the SCA prior to his final use. He reiterated this explanation \non his sworn answer more than a year later. I find Applicant\u2019s testimony was not \ncredible.13  \n \nApplicant referred himself to the employment assistance program and was \nsubsequently referred to a psychologist. He had three appointments with the \npsychologist. He was diagnosed with depression and it was recommended because he \ndid not want to take any prescribed medications, that he should continue attending AA \nfor support. He attends AA three times a week and holds service positions at all three \nmeetings. Since returning to AA he is more honest about his feelings and has turned his \nwill and life over to God. He will continue to attend AA in the future because he believes \n \n \n10 Tr. 51-52. \n \n11 GE 4. \n \n12 Tr. 71. \n \n13 Tr. 35-37, 68-76. I have not considered Applicant\u2019s statements made to the investigator for \ndisqualifying purposes, but I have considered them when evaluating his credibility and under the whole \nperson. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nit works and he has a life worth living. If something should happen to Applicant\u2019s son he \nwould continue to use the AA program for support.14  \n \nApplicant admits that his use of marijuana was wrong and he has no intention of \nusing it again in the future. He provided a signed document indicating that his clearance \nmay be automatically revoked if he uses illegal drugs in the future.15 He admits he used \npoor judgment.  \n \nApplicant first attended AA in approximately April 2001 and cut back on his \nattendance in 2006.16 \n \nApplicant told the Vice President of the company where is employed about his \nmarijuana use and that his clearance was going to be revoked. He also told the Director \nwho he reports directly to. He was concerned about how his job would be affected if he \ndid not have a clearance. He admitted he is embarrassed and humiliated about his drug \nuse.17 \n \nApplicant\u2019s program director testified on his behalf. He has been his supervisor \nfor approximately a year and a half. Applicant informed him of his drug use and that he \ndid not intend to use drugs in the future. He also told him about the falsification. The \nprogram director considers Applicant trustworthy and would trust him with a top secret \nclearance. He considers Applicant an excellent worker. He was aware of Applicant\u2019s \nson\u2019s health problems and that when Applicant came to work for the company he was \nvery interested in the company\u2019s health benefits.18  \n \nApplicant\u2019s former program manager and AA sponsor testified on his behalf. He \nhas known Applicant for eight years. Since late April 2007 he has almost daily contact \nwith Applicant and believes he wants to be sober. Applicant admitted to his sponsor that \nhe lied on his SCA and was remorseful. He would trust Applicant with classified \ninformation.19 \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife testified on his behalf. Sometime in May 2007, Applicant \nadmitted to her that he smoked marijuana. She believes he was depressed about their \nson and made a mistake. She thinks he is happier now and more relaxed. He is a good \nhusband and a good father. She believes he was under a great deal of pressure and his \n \n14 Tr. 37-43, 61-63, 76-77. \n \n15 AE A. \n \n16 Tr. 19. \n \n17 Tr. 42-45, 57-58. \n \n18 Tr. 59, 81-93. \n \n19 Tr. 19, 95-104. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \nactions were in the past and they will not happen again. She commented that when a \nfamily has a sick child it tears some families apart, but it has made their family closer.20  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n \n20 Tr. 106-110. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement:  \nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may \nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Drugs are \ndefined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include: (1) \nDrugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed in \nthe Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or \ncannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2) \ninhalants and other similar substances; Drug abuse is the illegal use of a \ndrug or use of a legal drug in a manner that deviates from approved \nmedical direction.\u201d \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions under Drug Involvement AG \u00b6 25 \nand especially considerer the following: \n \n(a) any drug abuse; \n \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia, and  \n \n(g) any illegal drug use after being granted a security clearance. \n \nApplicant had marijuana in his house from at least November 2006 to April 2007. \nApplicant used marijuana on several occasions during December 2006 and again in \nApril 2007. He held a security clearance at the time he used the marijuana. I find all of \nthe above disqualifying conditions apply. \n \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under Drug Involvement AG \u00b6 \n26 and especially considered the following: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent or happened \nunder circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment, and  \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(b) a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs are used; (3) an appropriate period \nof abstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of \nclearance for any violation.  \n \n \nApplicant used illegal drugs in 1969 and 1970. His son was born with serious \nongoing life threatening health issues. He knew marijuana was in his house in \nNovember 2006 and he did not remove it. He became depressed and stressed and \nused marijuana on several occasions in December 2006 while holding a security \nclearance. Although he felt badly that he used the drugs he still did not remove them \nfrom his house. Again in April 2007 he used the marijuana that was in his house.  \n \nApplicant has lived for 21 years under the strain of his son\u2019s fragile health. His \nson\u2019s health continues to be fragile and at times life threatening. Applicant held a \nsecurity clearance during the occasions he used marijuana in December 2006 and April \n2007. He was 58 years old at the time. It is undeniable that he was under a great deal of \nstress, but his decisions on more than one occasion to resort to drug use are troubling. \nAlthough he has the support from AA, I am not convinced that the circumstances under \nwhich he used illegal drugs were unusual or unlikely to recur. His willingness to \njeopardize his job and the health insurance his son desperately needs leads me to \nquestion his judgment and reliability. His actions were not spontaneous. Rather he kept \nthe marijuana in his house for a significant period of time and after his uses in \nDecember 2006 he continued to keep the drugs. This is a cause for concern. I find (a) \ndoes not apply. \n \n \nApplicant sought help from his AA sponsor and is now regularly attending AA and \nhas daily contact with his sponsor. His approach to sobriety is one day at a time. His \nson\u2019s health, although stable, continues to be serious. He has not used illegal drugs \nsince April 2007. Applicant promised not to use illegal drugs again and has offered a \nsigned statement of automatic clearance revocation. It appears he is following through \nwith regular attendance at AA and daily contact with his sponsor. I find (b) applies.  \n \n \nI find the allegation in SOR \u00b61.c is redundant with \u00b61.a. I also find that SOR \u00b61.d \nis not a disqualifying factor, but rather is mitigating.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n\n \n9 \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have specifically considered the following: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nI have considered all of the facts and find Applicant deliberately failed to divulge \nand intentionally meant to mislead the government about his December 2006 marijuana \nuses and his April 2007 marijuana use. I find (a) applies. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from personal conduct. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions and especially considered the following under AG \u00b6 17: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and  \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant was aware that when he completed his SCA that he was not truthful \nand failed to divulge his illegal drug use. His explanation that he was going to divulge it \nto the investigator when he was interviewed is not believable. It is also inconsistent with \nhis later answer to the SOR that states he merely forgot to divulge the information and \nhad submitted his SCA before his last use. He never contacted the investigator prior to \nthe interview to divulge the information. He vacillated during his testimony with different \nexplanations for why he did not divulge the information. I do not find AG \u00b6 17(a) applies \nbecause Applicant did not make a good-faith effort to correct the concealment. I also do \nnot find AG \u00b6 17(b) applies because his falsification was not minor, but rather serious \nconsidering the nature of the omission and the fact he held a security clearance at the \ntime. His explanations and falsifications continue to cast doubt about his \ntrustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment. Although Applicant has now \nacknowledged his drug use he seemed to have difficulty admitting his falsifications and \n\n \n10 \n \n \nrepeatedly contradicted himself. He was not completely honest with the investigator \nwhen he told her he submitted his SCA before the April 2007 drug use. That statement \nwas not true. When he did admit the December 2006 drug use to the investigator he \nrevealed that the reason for his failure to divulge it on his SCA was because he forgot. \nThis explanation was a clear contradiction from his explanation that he wanted to have \nan opportunity to provide an explanation to the investigator so he did not divulge it \nearlier. He reiterated this explanation in his answer to the SOR. Applicant lied by not \ndivulging his drug use on his SCA. He lied again when he explained the reason for not \ndivulging the information was because he wanted to first have an opportunity to explain \nhis use to the investigator. Instead he told the investigator that he forgot the drug use so \ndid not include it. I did not find his testimony credible. I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(d) and (e) do not \napply. \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was 58 years old when he \nreintroduced illegal drug use into his life. His illegal drug use was while holding a \nsecurity clearance. He is a recovering alcoholic and has been dealing with the serious \nmedical condition of his son for his entire life. He has signed a statement and agreed to \nthe automatic revocation of his security clearance should he abuse drugs in the future. \nHe is committed to AA and he is in contact with his sponsor daily. Although Applicant \nhas professed and made a firm commitment to never use illegal drugs again, I am \nconcerned about his untruthfulness when coming to grips with why he failed to divulge \nhis drug use. He sought help from his sponsor the day after his last marijuana use. He \nsubmitted his SCA days later on May 3, 2007, but did not change his answer. Later in \nJune 2007, with time to reflect on his marijuana use and discuss it with his sponsor, he \ndivulged the use to the investigator, but was not honest in telling her why he failed to \n\n \n11 \n \n \ndivulge it in the first place. He told the investigator that he forgot the drug use in \nDecember 2006 and the drug use in April 2007 was after he had submitted the SCA. \nThis was not true. Both of his explanations provided to the investigator were \ninconsistent with his hearing testimony. If Applicant was truly committed to the tenants \nof AA and abstaining from future drug use he would have been consistently honest. I \nam unable to reconcile his commitment to abstention of illegal drug use with his \nexplanation failing to divulge it on his SCA. Therefore I find he failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns under the guidelines for Drug Involvement and Personal Conduct. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.d: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph, Guideline E: \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Coacher, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nHistory of Case\nOn June 10, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant\nto Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated\nJanuary 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the\nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to\ndetermine whether his clearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on July 2, 2008, and elected to have his case\ndecided on the basis of the written record.  Applicant received the File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM) on December 5, 2008.  Applicant did not submit any information in\nresponse to the FORM.  The case was assigned to me on January 6, 2009.  Based upon\na review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility to access classified\ninformation is denied.\nMarch 10, 2009\n\n2\nBesides its 11 exhibits, the Government requested administrative notice of six\ndocuments: Background Note: Nigeria, U.S. Department of State (July 2008);\nCongressional Research Service, CRS Report for Congress, Nigeria: Current Issues\n(January 2008); Country Specific Information, Nigeria, U.S. Department of State (June\n2008); Country Reports on Human Rights Practices - 2007, Nigeria, U.S. Department of\nState (March 2008); Travel Warning: Nigeria, U.S. Department of State (October 2007);\nWarden Message, U.S. Diplomatic Mission, Nigeria (June 2008).\nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for\nadministrative proceedings.  See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. April 12, 2007);\nISCR Case No. 05-11292 (App. Bd. April 12, 2007).  Administrative notice is appropriate\nfor noticing facts or government reports that are well known.  See Stein, Administrative\nLaw, Sec. 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006).  For good cause shown, administrative notice was\ngranted with respect to the above-named background reports addressing the geopolitical\nsituation in Nigeria.  Administrative notice was extended to the documents themselves,\nconsistent with the provisions of Rule 201 of Fed. R. Evi.  This notice did not foreclose\nApplicant from challenging the accuracy and reliability of the information contained in the\nreports addressing Nigeria\u2019s current state.  \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline B, Applicant is alleged (a) to have a mother and father who are\ncitizens and residents of Nigeria, (b) to have a sister and brother who are citizens and\nresidents of Nigeria, and (c) to have traveled to Nigeria every other year during the\nperiod 1998 through 2005. \nUnder Guideline C, Applicant is alleged to (i) possess a Nigerian passport that\nwas issued in November 2005 and does not expire until November 2010 and (ii) be a\ndual citizen of the U.S. and Nigeria.\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have nine delinquent that exceed\n$7,000.00.  Two of these debts are allegedly charged off.\nFor his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted some of the allegations, but denied\nothers.  He admitted that he traveled to Nigeria on several occasions between 1998 and\n2005 to visit his parents, but did not answer any of the remaining allegations concerning\nthe country status of his parents and siblings.  He admitted to carrying a Nigerian\npassport with his green card when he joined the military.  He claimed to have last used\nhis Nigerian passport when he traveled to Nigeria to visit his parents, and is willing to\nturn in the passport to demonstrate his U.S. allegiance as a U.S. army veteran of the Iraq\nWar.  Applicant stressed the importance he attached to his U.S. citizenship and\nexpressed his willingness to resolve all of his Nigerian citizenship issues.\nApplicant admitted most of his alleged debts.  He denied any debts with creditors\n3.c and 3.g through 3.i., however, and claimed to have paid off these latter disputed\ncreditors.  \n\n3\n      \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 37-year-old technician for a defense contractor who seeks a\nsecurity clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are\nadopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nApplicant\u2019s background\nApplicant was born and raised in Nigeria to parents of Nigerian citizenship and\nresidency.  By virtue of his birth to Nigerian parents, Applicant was eligible for Nigerian\ncitizenship himself.  Through his parents he became a Nigerian citizen and attended\nNigerian primary and secondary schools.\nApplicant immigrated to the U.S. from Nigeria in July 1997 to pursue higher\neducation goals.  He applied for U.S. citizenship and became a naturalized U.S. citizen\nin September 2004 (see ex. 8).  After becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen, he retained\nhis Nigerian citizenship.  He remains a dual citizen of the U.S. and Nigeria (ex. 8).\nApplicant also retained his Nigerian passport (due to expire in November 2010) and used\nit on several occasions between 1998 and 2002 when traveling to Nigeria to visit his\nfamily (ex. 8).  He expressed a willingness to surrender his Nigerian passport should he\nbe asked to do so, but has failed to take any steps to surrender it to date (see exs. 7 and\n8).  So, too, he expressed his willingness to renounce his Nigerian citizenship should he\nbe asked, but has failed to take any documented steps to surrender the passport to his\nfacility clearance officer (FSO), or other authorized official.\nShortly after his arrival in the U.S., Applicant enlisted in the U.S. Army (ex. 8).\nBetween August 1998 and March 2005, he served in the Army as a new member/gunner\n(see ex. 1).  \nApplicant\u2019s mother and father are citizens and residents of Nigeria.  His father is a\nretired school teacher, and his mother is a trades woman (see ex. 8).  Also, he has a\nsister and brother who are citizens and residents of Nigeria (ex. 8).  His sister is a\nbanker; while his brother\u2019s occupation is unknown.  The administrative record does not\nprovide any documentation of whether or not the parents and siblings have ever worked\nor associated with officials of the Nigerian government and military.\nDuring the period of 1998 through 2005, Applicant traveled bi-annually to Nigeria\nto visit his family.  Typically, he spent 10 to 14 days on his visits.  Before he became a\nU.S. citizen, he used his Nigerian passport to visit his parents in Nigeria.  On his last visit\nto Nigeria in 2005, though, he used his U.S. passport (see ex. 8).  He renewed his\nNigerian passport in November 2005 only to avoid \u201ccorrupted Nigerian officials\u201d when he\ntraveled to Nigeria (ex. 7).\nApplicant communicates with his parents monthly by telephone, and speaks with\nhis sister once or twice a month by telephone (see ex. 8).  He maintains no reported\ncontacts with his brother in Nigeria (ex. 8).  \n\n4\nBefore immigrating to the U.S., Applicant married the woman he met in high\nschool and dated in college.  He married W in July 1997 just before departing for the\nU.S. (Ex. 8).  Following his 1998 enlistment in the Army, he applied for W\u2019s entry into the\nU.S.  Three years later (in 2002), he was advised by U.S. Immigration officials that W\ncould not be granted an immigration visa (reasons unknown).  For the three years of W\u2019s\npending visa application, Applicant mailed money to W in Nigeria (ex. 8). \nTired of waiting for a visa, W filed for divorce in Nigeria and obtained a marriage\nnullification in February 2005.  Applicant mailed his last payment ($1,500.00) to W in\nFebruary 2005.  It is unclear whether Applicant mailed the $1,500.00 before or after he\nwas notified of W\u2019s divorce application (see ex. 4).  \nApplicant has no children from his marriage to W.  He has no property in Nigeria,\nand has never served in the Nigerian military.  Nor has he ever voted in a Nigerian\nelection.  Applicant has three half-sisters.  His last contact with his ex-wife and her family\nwas in 2005 (ex. 8).\nNigeria\u2019s country status\nNigeria is a federal republic in western Africa that gained its independence from\nGreat Britain in 1960 as a federation of three regions (northern, western and eastern).\nToday, Nigeria comprises 36 states and the capital territory of Lagos.  It has a population\nbase of 140 million (see Background Note: Nigeria, U.S. Department of State (July\n2008).  Since gaining its independence, Nigeria has experienced periods of political\ninstability, economic crises, ethnic and religious conflict, extreme poverty, a lack of law\nand order, judicial corruption, and military coups (CRS Report for Congress, Nigeria:\nCurrent Issues (January 2008).  Nigeria has been ruled by its military for 28 of its 43\nyears since independence (see Background Note, Nigeria, supra, at 2-5).  The country\nreturned to civilian rule in May 1999 with the democratic election of Olusegun Obasanjo\n(id. at 5).\nBesides being the largest trading partner of the U.S. in sub-Saharan Africa, with\ntotal two-way trade valued at $30.8 billion, Nigeria remains Africa\u2019s largest oil producer.\nState Department reports confirm that Nigeria\u2019s bilateral relationship with the U.S. has\ncontinued to improve (see Background Note, Nigeria, supra, at 6-7).  However, the trade\nbalance favors significantly favors Nigeria due to its oil exports, which continue to be\nsubstantial, \n Insurgent activities have brought turmoil to the Niger Delta region\u2019s oil producing\nsector over perceived uneven and/or unfair oil revenue distribution (see Background\nNote: Nigeria, supra, at 7-8).  In response to numerous reports of kidnaping for ransom\nof persons associated with the petroleum sector (including U.S. citizens), the U.S. State\nDepartment has updated its Travel Warning for Nigeria in October 2007 (see Travel\nWarning: Nigeria, U.S. Department of State (October 2007)).  The Travel Warning\nadvises U.S. citizens of the dangers of travel to Nigeria and of further deterioration of\nsecurity in the Niger Delta region. The Travel Warning states, too, that al-Qaida\n\n5\nleadership operating in the region has expressed interest in overthrowing the ruling\nauthorities (see id., at 1).\nWidely circulated reports of ransom kidnaping of oil sector personnel in recent\nyears in the Niger Delta region of Nigeria are attributed to hatched schemes by radical\ngroups in the oil-rich Delta region to extort money out of foreign governments (see CRS\nReport for Congress, Nigeria: Current Issues, supra, at 16).  This has created tensions\nwith the U.S., and the long-term impacts these actions have on Nigeria\u2019s oil industry in\ngeneral are still unclear.\nDespite its democratic government and an established judiciary, Nigeria\u2019s\ngovernment suffers from a poor human rights record (see  Country Reports on Human\nRights Practices - 2007, Nigeria, U.S. Department of State (March 2008)).  The State\nDepartment\u2019s Country Reports on Human Rights Practices documents Nigerian\ngovernment officials at all levels committing serious abuses against Nigeria\u2019s citizens\nand visitors.  Sani Abacha\u2019s regime was especially repressive. Under his regime, all\nbranches of the security forces committed serious human rights abuses.  Documented\nabuses by security forces include politically motivated, extrajudicial killings as well as\ntorture and arbitrary arrest (see id., at 5-6).  Instability and incidents of armed conflicts\nbetween religious, political, and ethnic factions comprising Muslim, Christian and other\nethnic groups have marked Nigeria\u2019s political landscape (see Travel Warning: Nigeria,\nsupra, at 1).  Since Abacha\u2019s death in June 1998, his replacements have released most\nknown civilian political detainees (see Background Note: Nigeria, supra, at 5).  \nIn the areas of peace and security, the U.S. has supported peacekeeping and\nsimulation centers at Nigeria\u2019s armed forces staff college (Africa\u2019s only such center),\nwhile promoting effective civilian oversight of the military and its adherence to human\nrights norms (see  Background Note: Nigeria, supra, at 10).  In addition to its efforts\naimed at fostering maritime cooperation with security services in the Niger Delta region,\nthe U.S. has continued to support the European union\u2019s leading role in helping Nigeria\nfight corruption, organized criminal elements, drug traffickers, and terrorists (see id.).\nReports confirm that Nigeria remains a member in good standing of ECOWAS, a West-\nAfrican trade union and a constructive trading partner with the U.S. (see id.). \nApplicant\u2019s finances\nApplicant incurred a number of delinquent debts before he relocated to a Western\nEuropean country in 2001.  One of the listed debts represents a personal loan he used to\nsend money to his parents following his immigration to the U.S.  The delinquent amount\non this creditor 3.a debt is $1,320.00.  Applicant has not heard from this creditor since\n2001, and has not repaid this debt. \nApplicant disputes two of the listed delinquent debts.  He claims he paid the\ncreditor 3.d debt in 2005 through a represented collection agent (see ex. 8).  He\ndocuments a money order made out to the collection agent of the creditor in the amount\nof $550.00 (see ex. 3).  Applicant\u2019s credit report lists a past due balance of $1,328.00 for\n\n6\nthis creditor, as of October 2005, and Applicant provides no further proof of his satisfying\nthis debt in full.  Applicant also disputes the listed delinquent debts with creditors 3.c, 3.f,\n3.g and 3.I (ex. 3). Of these debts, he documents payments in full to creditors 3.c and\n3.h (see exs. 3 and 8).  He claims no familiarity with creditors 3.f and 3.g.  Applicant\nprovides no proof of any documented disputes with the credit reporting agencies or the\ncreditors themselves with respect to any of his disputed creditors.  However, none of\nApplicant\u2019s claimed disputes with creditors 3.c, 3.f, 3.g and 3.i (see ex. 3) are listed in his\nmost recent credit report (see ex. 3).  Based on Applicant\u2019s claims and the absence of\nany notation of these creditors in his most recent credit report, Applicant is credited with\nresolving his disputed debts with creditors 3.c, 3.f, 3.g, and 3.i.\nApplicant does not dispute any of the remaining debts listed in the SOR (i.e.,\ncreditors 3.a, 3.b, and 3.e), and provides no proof of payment of these debts (see exs. 3\nand 8).  By all credible accounts, he remains indebted to these creditors in the\napproximate total amount of $5,300.00.  He provides no evidence of payment plans to\naddress any of these listed creditors and no documented credit counseling.\nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\nadministrative judges in the decision-making process covering DOHA cases.  These\nGuidelines require the administrative judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could\nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and\nall of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\" if any, before deciding whether or not a security\nclearance should be granted, continued or denied.  The Guidelines do not require the\nadministrative judge to assess these factors exclusively in arriving at a decision.  In\naddition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, administrative judges must take into\naccount the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in\nE.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are intended to\nassist the administrative judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy concerns are pertinent herein:\nForeign Influence\nThe Concern: \u201cForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under the this Guideline can and should considered the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism.\u201d  See Adjudicative Guideline (AG) B, \u00b6 6.\n\n7\nForeign Preference\nThe Concern: \u201cWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference\nfor a foreign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide\ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d  See\nAG C, \u00b6 9.\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is\nalso a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\u201d See AG F \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the Directive, a decision to grant or continue\nan Applicant's request for security clearance may be made only upon a threshold finding\nthat to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.  Because the Directive\nrequires administrative judges to make a common sense appraisal of the evidence\naccumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an applicant's eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance and materiality of that\nevidence. As with all adversary proceedings, the Judge may draw only those inferences\nwhich have a reasonable and logical basis from the evidence of record.  Conversely, the\nJudge cannot draw factual inferences that are grounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfacts alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not require\nthe Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually mishandled\nor abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security clearance.\nRather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an applicant may\ndeliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted or\ncontroverted facts, the burden of proof shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation or\nmitigation of the Government's case.\n\n8\nAnalysis\nApplicant presents as a technician for a defense contractor who after being born\nand raised in Nigeria, immigrated to the U.S. in 1997 to pursue his education and\nbecame a naturalized citizen in 2004.  Claiming the need for a Nigerian passport to aid\nhim in traveling back to Nigeria, he retained his Nigerian passport after becoming a U.S.\ncitizen and obtaining a U.S. passport. \nDual citizenship concerns necessarily entail country allegiance assessments and\ninvite critical considerations over acts indicating a preference or not for the interests of\nthe foreign country over the interests of the U.S.  In a different vein, the continued\nresidence of his immediate family members (his parents and younger brother) and his\nwife\u2019s immediate family members in Nigeria raise potential concerns about their being\nvulnerable to future pressure or duress that could result in the compromise of classified\ninformation. The issues, as such, raise concerns over Applicant\u2019s preference for a\nforeign country over the U.S., and the potential for members of Applicant\u2019s immediate\nand extended family being placed at risk to pressure or duress to induce Applicant to\ndivulge classified information he might be privy to.\nForeign Influence\nSecurity concerns are raised over the presence of Applicant\u2019s immediate family\n(i.e., his parents, sister and brother) who are citizens and residents of Nigeria, a country\nhistorically plagued by military coups, domestic turmoil, and a poor human rights record.\nDepartment Counsel urges security concerns over risks that Applicant\u2019s parents, sister,\nand brother residing in Nigeria might be subject to undue foreign influence by Nigerian\ngovernment and military authorities to access classified information in Applicant\u2019s\npossession or control. \n Because Applicant\u2019s immediate family members reside in Nigeria, they present\npotential heightened security risks covered by disqualifying condition (DC) \u00b6 7(a),\n\u201ccontact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or\nother person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a\nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion,\u201d\nof the Adjudication Guidelines for foreign influence. The citizenship/residence status of\nthese immediate family members and in-laws in Nigeria pose some potential concerns\nfor Applicant because of the risks of undue foreign influence that could compromise\nsensitive or classified information under Applicant's possession and/or control. \nThe administrative record does not contain enough information to determine\nwhether any of Applicant\u2019s parents or siblings have any connections with the Nigerian\ngovernment or military.  Without some evidence of family connections to the Nigerian\ngovernment or military, consideration of DC \u00b6 7(b), \u201cconnection to a foreign person,\ngroup, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the\nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s\n\n9\ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information,\u201d is not\nwarranted. \nFurther, from what is known from the presented evidence, it remains unclear\nwhether any of Applicant\u2019s  immediate family residing in Nigeria have any (a) political\naffiliations with Nigeria\u2019s government or military, (b) history to date of being subjected to\nany coercion or influence, or (c) are vulnerable to the same.  All that is known about\napplicant\u2019s parents is that Applicant\u2019s father is a retired school teacher and his mother is\na trades woman.  With the exception of his father\u2019s likely teacher\u2019s pension, neither his\nparents nor siblings have any known tangible financial interests associated with the\nNigerian government. \nNigeria, although a country reported to have a history of military coups and human\nrights violations, enjoys a non-hostile relationship with the U.S., and is a democratic\ngovernment with some respect for the rule of law in the areas of foreign trade and\ncommerce.  While Nigeria has a documented record of turmoil and kidnaping in its oil-\nrich Niger Delta region, it generally enjoys stable diplomatic and trade relationships with\nthe U.S. \nThe Adjudicative Guidelines governing collateral clearances do not dictate per se\nresults or mandate particular outcomes for applicants with relatives who are\ncitizens/residents of foreign countries in general.  What is considered to be an\nacceptable risk in one foreign country may not be in another.  While foreign influence\ncases must by practical necessity be weighed on a case-by-case basis, guidelines are\navailable for referencing in the supplied materials and country information about Nigeria. \nNigeria remains a non-hostile trading partner of the U.S. and is a country whose\ndemocratic institutions are not wholly incompatible with our own traditions and respect\nfor human rights and the rule of law.  Unlike the old Adjudicative Guidelines, the new\nones do take into account the country\u2019s demonstrated relations with the U.S. as an\nimportant consideration in gauging whether the particular relatives with citizenship and\nresidency elsewhere create a heightened security risk. The Appeal Board has been clear\nand consistent in its holdings that the nature of the foreign government, the intelligence\ngathering history of that government, and the presence of terrorist activity in the country\nare material to a foreign influence case.  See ISCR Case No. 07-07266 (App. Bd. Dec.\nJune 27, 2008); ISCR Case no. 02-26130 (App. Bd. Dec. Dec. 7, 2006). \nSo, clearly, the geopolitical aims and policies of the particular foreign regime\ninvolved do matter.  Nigeria, while reported to have human rights and insurgency issues\nin its Niger Delta region, is still a country with no known recent history of government-\nsponsored hostage taking or disposition for exerting undue influence against family\nmembers to obtain either classified information, or unclassified economic and proprietary\ndata. \n\n10\nAs for security concerns associated with the presence of Applicant's relatives in\nNigeria, any potential heightened risk of a hostage situation or undue foreign influence\nbrought in the hopes of eliciting either classified information or economic or proprietary\ndata out of Applicant through his family members residing in Nigeria is quite remote.\nApplicant, accordingly, may take advantage of one important mitigating condition: MC \u00b6\n8(a), \u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these\npersons are located, or the persons or activities of these persons in that country are such\nthat it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between\nthe interests of a foreign a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S.\u201d  Since relocating to the U.S. in  1997, Applicant has demonstrated\nloyalty, patriotism, and professional commitments to the U.S.  Whatever potential\nconflicts he may have through his dual Nigerian citizenship and contacts with his family\nmembers in Nigeria have been more than counterbalanced by his demonstrated U.S.\ncitizenship responsibilities.  \nAppraising risks associated with Applicant\u2019s dual citizenship status with Nigeria,\nthe presence of Applicant family members in Nigeria, his past family visits to Nigeria, and\nhis regular contacts with these family members, any risk of undue foreign influence on\nApplicant and/or his parents and siblings, who reside in Nigeria would appear to be\ninsubstantial, and clearly not of the magnitude that could make them subject to a\nheightened security risk of coercion, pressure or compromise under Guideline B.\nWhole person assessment also serves to minimize Applicant\u2019s exposure to\nconflict of interests with his Nigerian family members.  Not only is Applicant a naturalized\nU.S. citizen and U.S. Army veteran, but he has made every effort to work, save, and\npursue his financial interests exclusively in the U.S.  Any likelihood of coercion, pressure,\nor influence being brought to bear on any of his immediate family members would\nappear to be minimal.  By all reasonable accounts of the presented record, Applicant has\nno visible conflicts of interest with Nigerian citizen/residents or property interests in\nNigeria that could be at risk to exploitation or compromise by Nigerian military or\nintelligence officials.  \nOverall, any potential security concerns attributable to Applicant's family members\nresiding in Nigeria are sufficiently mitigated to permit safe predictive judgments about\nApplicant's ability to withstand risks of undue influence attributable to his familial\nrelationships in Nigeria.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations\ncovered by sub-paragraphs 1.a through 1c of Guideline B.\nForeign Preference\nBy virtue of his birth in Nigeria to parents of Nigerian descent and citizenship,\nApplicant was endowed with Nigerian citizenship through his parents.  This citizenship\ncould not be lost except by express renunciation, approved by the Nigerian Government,\nwhich Applicant has never explored.  He has never used his renewed Nigerian passport,\nsince he became a naturalized citizen, and indicates a willingness to surrender it if he\n\n11\nwere asked to do so.  Presumably, he still retains his Nigerian passport.  He has\nprovided no documentation of his surrendering the passport to his FSO, or other\nauthorized official.  Risks of his being taken hostage behind Nigerian lines and denied\nthe customary diplomatic intercession made available to U.S. citizens traveling on U.S.\npassports remain for so long as Applicant retains his Nigerian passport. \nThe Appeal Board has tended to blur convenience/force of law distinctions when\nappraising claimed legal necessity reasons (concerns about dealing with Nigerian\nofficials in applicant\u2019s case) for holding onto a foreign passport.  See ISCR Case No. 99-\n0424 (App. Bd. February 8, 2001); ISCR Case No. 99-0254 (App. Bd. February 16,\n2000).  To be sure, his exercise of choice to renew and retain his Nigerian passport for\nback-up support when traveling to Nigeria after becoming a U.S. citizen is itself a\nvoluntary election.  His election was  not a submission to legal compulsion, when made\nin juxtaposition to known security risks extant in traveling to a country that lacks\nacceptable security protections against terrorists operating within the country.  By\napplying for renewal of a Nigerian passport, Applicant provides some indicia of a\nconscious preference for Nigeria, even if it was for perfectly logical and understandable\nreasons: wanting to avoid confrontations with Nigerian officials. \nSo, even Applicant\u2019s limited exercise of dual citizenship is sufficient under the\nfacts of this case to invoke one disqualifying condition of the Guidelines covering foreign\npreference: DC 10(a), \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or obligation of foreign citizenship\nafter becoming a U.S. citizen or through the foreign citizenship of a family member\n(inclusive of possession of a current foreign passport.\u201d  Concerns over Applicant\u2019s\nforeign preference for Nigeria through his continued possession of his Nigerian passport\nand dual U.S.-Nigerian citizenship remain considerable.  \nApplicant has no assets in Nigeria, though, and assures his preference is for the\nU.S.  He has never voted in a Nigerian election, served in Nigeria\u2019s military, or worked\nfor Nigeria\u2019s government.  By contrast, all of his assets and financial interests are\nsituated in the U.S..  And in his case, his dual citizenship with Nigeria is based solely on\nhis parents\u2019 Nigerian citizenship and his birth in that country. Based on these\nconsiderations, one mitigating condition is partially applicable to Applicant\u2019s situation: MC\n\u00b6 11(b), \u201cthe individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.\u201d\nHowever, because he conditioned his willingness to renounce his Nigerian citizenship on\nsomeone\u2019s requesting him to do so first, the mitigating condition has only limited\napplication. \nTwo potentially applicable mitigating conditions may not be considered.  Having\nexercised a privilege of his dual Nigerian citizenship by renewing his Nigerian passport in\n2005, Applicant is not in a position to claim the mitigation benefits of these two mitigating\nconditions: MC \u00b6 11(a), \u201cdual citizenship is based solely on his parents\u2019 citizenship or\nbirth in a foreign country,\u201d and MC \u00b6 11(c), \u201cexercise of the rights, privileges, or\nobligations of foreign citizenship occurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or\nwhen the individual was a minor.\u201d\n\n12\nConsidering all of the circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s dual citizenship\nexercise and lack of any documented surrender of his Nigerian passport or clear\nexpression of an intent to renounce his Nigerian citizenship, conclusions warrant that\nApplicant\u2019s exhibited active dual citizenship by his renewing and possessing a Nigerian\npassport after becoming a U.S. citizen is not mitigated.  His qualified intentions with\nrespect to his Nigerian passport and dual citizenship status do not satisfy expressed\nAppeal Board burden requirements relative to successful discounting residual security\nrisks that exist with his continued exercise of dual Nigerian citizenship.  Unfavorable\nconclusions warrant with respect to sub-paragraphs 2.a and 2.b of Guideline C. \nFinancial concerns\nSecurity concerns are also raised under the financial considerations guideline.\nApplicant\u2019s accumulation of a number of delinquent debts and his failure to mount any\nsustained effort to resolve the three largest debts listed in the SOR warrant the\napplication of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the AGs for financial\nconsiderations: \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history\nof not meeting financial obligations.\u201d  \nSince receiving the SOR, Applicant has not provided any documentation of his\npursuing financial counseling, establishing a payment plan, or addressing his three\nlargest debts.  Aside  from his probative efforts in paying or resolving his six smaller\ndebts listed in the SOR, he has not been able to make any tangible headway with any of\nhis other charged off and collection accounts.  Without any evidence of counseling and\naddressing these remaining debts, Applicant may not take advantage of MC \u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe\nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear\nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d \nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.  Financial\nstability in a person cleared to access classified information is required precisely to\ninspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While the principal concern of\na clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and\ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are explicit in financial cases (as here) and bring\ninto play security concerns covered by the financial considerations guideline. \nBased on the limited information available in this administrative record, it appears\nthat Applicant has not been in a financial position to make any concerted progress in\naddressing his three largest debts to date.  Based on these exhibited circumstances, MC\n\u00b6 20(b) of the financial considerations guideline, \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nbehavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the\nindividual acted responsibility,\u201d has some applicability to Applicant\u2019 inability to resolve his\ndebt issues.  MC \u00b6 20(b) cannot be fully applied, however, due to the lack of sufficient\n\n13\ninformation from Applicant on the origination, payment history, and attempted repayment\nefforts since receiving the SOR.   \nTo be sure, Applicant could reasonably be expected to have initiated more timely\nand material repayment efforts with the resources available to him following his military\ndischarge.  While his initiated debt identification efforts are encouraging, it is still too\nsoon to mitigate his historical difficulties with his finances, given the lack of any\nsignificant repayment progress he has been able to demonstrate to date with his three\nmajor creditors..\nWhole person assessment of Applicant\u2019s financial problems is hampered by the\nlimited amount of information supplied in this administrative record.  Applicant is able to\nshow some extenuating circumstances associated with his divorce.  And his military\nservice with the Army is commendable and worthy of increased overall trust.  His\ndemonstrated resolution of his smaller debts is indicative of some earnest resolve and\naccountability, and adds some positive reflections of his overall judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness while holding a security clearance.  His lack of any tangible attention to\nhis old debts, however, still leaves doubts about the stability of his finances at the\npresent time. These doubts cannot be reconciled with minimum requirements for\nretaining the Government\u2019s confidence in his financial judgment, reliability and\ntrustworthiness.\nTaking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s\ndebt accumulations and corrective steps she has demonstrated to date, Applicant fails to\nmitigate security concerns related to his outstanding debt delinquencies and judgment\nlapses associated therein. Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the\nallegations covered by the financial considerations guideline.\n  \nIn reaching my recommended decision, I have considered the evidence as a\nwhole, including each of the factors and conditions enumerated in E2(a) of the\nAdjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR in the context of the findings of fact,\nconclusions, and the factors and conditions listed above, I make the following separate\nformal findings with respect to Applicant's eligibility for a security clearance.\nGUIDELINE B: (FOREIGN INFLUENCE):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 1.a through 1.c::\nFOR APPLICANT\nGUIDELINE C (FOREIGN PREFERENCE):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 2.a and 2.b:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n\n14\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 3.a:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 3.b:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 3.c:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 3.d:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 3.e:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSub-para. 3.f:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 3.g:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 3.h:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-para. 3.i\nFOR APPLICANT\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant's security\nclearance.
