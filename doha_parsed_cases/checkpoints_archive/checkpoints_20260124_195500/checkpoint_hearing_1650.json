His \nsingle use of cocaine in 2017 while unemployed, and his conduct between 2013 and 2015 \nthat resulted in two reprimands by his employer was infrequent, is unlikely to recur, and \nis not recent. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on April 5, 2019. On \nApril 10, 2020, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), alleging security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct). The DOD acted under Executive Order (Ex. Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective \nJune 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 22, 2020, and requested a decision based \non the written record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s \nfile of relevant material (FORM) on July 31, 2020, which included Government Exhibits \n(GX) 1 through 5. On August 12, 2020, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) transmittal letter and a complete copy of the FORM were sent to Applicant. \nApplicant\u2019s receipt is dated August 19, 2020. The DOHA transmittal letter informed \nApplicant that he had 30 days after his receipt to submit information. Applicant timely filed \na response. The DOHA transmittal letter and receipt are marked as Administrative Exhibit \n1. The case was assigned to me on October 20, 2020.  \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, 62, is a logistics analyst employed by a federal contractor since August \n2017. He served on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps from December 1984 until he \nretired in January 2005. While on active duty, he was awarded numerous medals and \ncommendations. He earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in 2002 and his master\u2019s degree in \n2015, and was enrolled in a technical institute from 2015 until 2016. He is divorced and \nhas three adult children. He previously held a security clearance while on active duty and \nwhile working for the government. (GX 1.) \nThe SOR alleges two debts: SOR \u00b6 1.a is a past-due mortgage loan for $60,036 \nand SOR \u00b6 1.b is a charged-off car-lease debt for $9,226. Applicant denies SOR \u00b6 1.a \nstating that he rehabilitated the account, and admits SOR \u00b6 1.b with an explanation. The \ndebts are reflected in Applicant\u2019s October 2019 credit bureau report (CBR) (GX 5). \nThe SOR further alleges that Applicant tested positive for cocaine in June 2017, \nwas reprimanded by his employer in 2014 and 2015 for failing to appear at work and for \nsubmitting improper timesheets, and was also reprimanded by his employer in 2014 for \nthe unauthorized use of a government sponsored credit card. In his answer, Applicant \nadmits these allegations. However, in his response to the FORM, Applicant explains that \nhe was reprimanded twice, once in 2014 for unauthorized use of his government-\nsponsored credit card and once in 2015 for failing to appear at work and submitting \nimproper timesheets in 2013 and 2015. The underlying facts of these reprimands and \nsuspensions are discussed more fully below. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated in \nmy findings of fact. \nAfter retiring from the Marine Corps, Applicant was employed by a federal \ncontractor from 2005 until 2009, when he obtained a position with a federal government \nagency. Following the Washington Navy Yard shooting in September 2013, Applicant \nmisunderstood the guidance for reporting in, and failed to timely contact his supervisor. It \nwas later determined by Applicant\u2019s employer that Applicant was absent from work \nwithout authorization and that he failed to properly submit his timesheets. In 2014, \nApplicant used his government-sponsored credit card for $260 of unauthorized charges. \nHe promptly repaid this account in full. However, these two actions resulted in Applicant\u2019s \nemployer reprimanding Applicant and suspending him for five days in June 2014. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn March 2015, there was a snowstorm and Applicant lost power to his home. He \nwas under the mistaken impression that the base where he was employed was closed \ndue to the inclement weather conditions. He did not report to work and did not contact his \nsupervisor until his power was restored. Applicant\u2019s employer took into account \nApplicant\u2019s prior conduct that resulted in his 2014 reprimand, and reprimanded him with \na suspension for 10 days. He remained employed by this federal agency until November \n2016. Applicant fully disclosed the circumstances of his two reprimands and suspensions \non his e-QIP. He regrets his actions and has no intention of engaging in any similar future \nconduct. \nIn November 2016, Applicant left his position with a federal agency to pursue other \nopportunities, but was not immediately successful. He was unemployed from November \n2016 until July 2017. During this period of unemployment, Applicant experienced \nsignificant financial strains and was unable to maintain his mortgage loan and automobile \nlease payments. \nIn 2016, Applicant contacted the creditor for his automobile lease, returned the \nvehicle, and paid the early termination fee for the lease. He thought the lease account \nwas satisfied and closed. It was not until he received the SOR that he became aware of \nthe outstanding balance of $9,226 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) on this account. He again contacted the \ncreditor and was told that the creditor had sold the vehicle and charged off the account. \nThe creditor informed Applicant that it would accept payment in full on the charged-off \naccount. This account remains unresolved. \nIn December 2018, Applicant entered a repayment agreement for his $60,036 \ndelinquent mortgage loan (SOR \u00b6 1.a). His monthly payments are $200. Applicant\u2019s \nmortgage lender stated in a letter from April 2020 that Applicant was in compliance with \nthe agreement and the loan balance was $32,142. (Answer.)  \nApplicant\u2019s CBR shows a credit history dating back to 2000 that includes paid off \npersonal loans, vehicle loans, credit cards, and current student loans. Applicant has not \nincurred any other delinquent accounts since his 2016-2017 period of unemployment. He \nis current on all his open accounts. (GX 5.) \nDuring his period of unemployment, Applicant became \u201cdepressed and \ndisillusioned about [his] possibilities and future.\u201d While attending a party in June 2017, \nsomeone offered Applicant cocaine and he used it. Applicant deeply regrets this conduct. \nShortly after this single use of cocaine, he tested positive during a pre-employment drug \nscreening. He stated that he has \u201cnot been involved with any of this type of activity before, \nor since.\u201d He recognizes the negative impact such conduct could have on his family, his \ncommunity and himself. He has no future intention of any illegal drug use. He fully \ndisclosed this conduct on his e-QIP. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack ofjudgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information\u2026. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe record evidence establishes the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: AG \u00b6 19(a): an inability to satisfy debts; and AG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances, and \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe conditions that caused Applicant to become delinquent on two of his financial \nobligations arose due to circumstances which were largely beyond his control. \nSpecifically, Applicant\u2019s financial issues are the result of a sustained period of \nunemployment. However, Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances. He \ncontacted the creditor of his vehicle lease, returned the vehicle, and paid the early \ntermination fee. Upon learning that there was a past-due balance on this account, \nApplicant again contacted the creditor but was informed that payment-in-full was required \nto resolve the account. The creditor did not attempt to collect this debt and has charged \noff the account. Applicant has been in compliance with the repayment agreement with his \nmortgage lender since December 2018. \nDespite his financial strains, Applicant managed to live within his means without \nincurring any additional debts. With the exception of the one outstanding SOR debt he \nincurred in 2016, Applicant has a long-standing sound financial record, which includes \nconsistent repayment of personal loans, credit cards, and vehicle loans. His credit report \nis indicative of someone who is currently financially stable and lives within his means. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts did not arise from lack of self-control, irresponsibility, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations and do not cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(c) apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide truthful and candid \nanswers during national security investigative or adjudicative processes. \nApplicant admitted that he was reprimanded by his employer between 2013 and \n2015 for failing to appear at work, for submitting improper timesheets, and for the \nunauthorized use of a government-sponsored credit card. His misconduct raises the \napplicability of the following personal conduct disqualifying conditions: \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under \nany other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \nThe following mitigating condition is potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct which resulted in two suspensions and reprimands at work and \nhis one-time use of cocaine constitute questionable judgment. However, Applicant has \nnot engaged in any type of misconduct in the workplace since 2015. I considered his 2014 \nand 2015 misconduct to be minor offenses because they did not result in his termination \nand he continued in this employment until he voluntarily left in November 2016 to seek \nother opportunities. He fully disclosed the circumstances of the events that led to the \nreprimands on his e-QIP. He is remorseful for his actions. \n \n \nApplicant stated that he regrets his decision to use cocaine one time in 2017. He \nhas no history of drug use and no future intent to use illegal drugs. He recognizes the \nnegative effects that could result from any such future conduct. In explaining the \ncircumstances surrounding his conduct, Applicant did not make any excuses for his \nbehavior, but instead accepted responsibility for his actions and expressed remorse. \n \n \nThere are no Abright line@ rules for determining when conduct is Arecent.@ The \ndetermination must be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence. If the \nevidence shows Aa significant period of time has passed without any evidence of \nmisconduct,@ then an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time \ndemonstrates Achanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform \nor rehabilitation.@ ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004).  \n \n \nIt has been over five years since Applicant has had any disciplinary issues in the \nworkplace and more than three years since his one-time use of cocaine. Applicant\u2019s past \nconduct was infrequent, is unlikely to recur, and does not cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 17(c) applies. \n \n \n \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances.  I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but I \nhave also considered the following: \n \n \nApplicant served honorably on active duty in the Marine Corps for over 20 years \nand was awarded multiple medals and commendations for his service. Due to a sustained \nperiod of unemployment, he became delinquent on two accounts, but acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. He has a strong credit history and is currently financially stable \nand fiscally responsible. He had a few instances of questionable judgment between 2013 \nand 2017 but accepts full responsibility for his mistakes and will not act in a questionable \nmanner in the future.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and \nE, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nhas mitigated the potential security concerns raised by his financial issues and personal \nconduct. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts regarding \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for access to classified information. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nFormal Findings \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.c: \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

Applicant has a history \nof problematic alcohol use as evidenced by six alcohol-related arrests and the \ntermination of his employment in June 2014 for violating his then employer\u2019s policy \nprohibiting alcohol consumption during duty hours. Although his last incident of alcohol-\nrelated misconduct occurred over six years ago, Applicant continues to consume \nalcohol daily. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 10, 2020, the DOD issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under the alcohol consumption and personal conduct guidelines. This \naction was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry, signed by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as \namended; as well as DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended (Directive), and the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position, implemented on June 8, \n2017.

(GE 5) \nSince 2014, there is no evidence that Applicant has engaged in any other \nalcohol-related misconduct. In a March 2019 interview with a background investigator, \nApplicant admitted consuming four beers every night at home. (SOR \u00b61.i, 2.a) He \nreported that he does not consume alcohol to the point of intoxication. Applicant \nexplained that he limits his alcohol consumption to only four beers to set a positive \nexample for his four children, ages 32, 29, 27, and 22. Aside from his criminal history \nand his 2014 termination, Applicant does not believe that his alcohol consumption has \nhad a negative impact on his life. (GE 3, 6) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nAlcohol Consumption \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. The record establishes the Government\u2019s \nprima facie case. Applicant has a 23-year history of alcohol-related criminal conduct, \nresulting in six alcohol-related arrests, four convictions, and two alcohol-related \nincidents at work that resulted in a June 2014 job termination. Applicant\u2019s history of \nalcohol-related misconduct is also evidence of habitual consumption of alcohol \nconsumption to the point of impaired judgment. Alcohol consumption disqualifying \nconditions 22(a), (b), and (c), apply. \nNone of the alcohol consumption mitigating conditions apply. Applicant has \nmisused alcohol for over 40 years with significant consequences. He continued to \nmisuse alcohol after four convictions, at least two alcohol education classes, the \nrevocation of his security clearance, and the loss of employment. Although the record \ndoes not contain any evidence that Applicant has been diagnosed with an alcohol-use \ndisorder, his attitude about his alcohol use is disconcerting. Applicant does not believe \nthat his use of alcohol is problematic. The latest available information indicates that \nApplicant continues to use alcohol daily and that he only limits on his daily alcohol \nconsumption to model appropriate use for his adult children. Given his attitude about his \nalcohol consumption, the problem is ongoing and continues to cast doubt on his current \nsecurity worthiness. Also, based on Applicant\u2019s history it is more likely than not that \nApplicant will engage in alcohol-related misconduct in the future. \nPersonal Conduct  \nAn applicant\u2019s personal conduct becomes a security concern when he acts in a \nway that raises questions about his judgment or his ability to protect classified \ninformation. The SOR cross-alleges Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related criminal and workplace \nmisconduct, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.g and 1.i, under this guideline. Because that conduct falls \nclearly within the alcohol consumption guideline, the security implications of that \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nconduct are most appropriately analyzed under that section. However, one allegation, \nSOR \u00b6 1.h, regarding Applicant\u2019s 2014 termination for violating his employer\u2019s alcohol \nuse policy is also disqualifying as a violating of a written or recorded commitment made \nby the individual to the employer as a condition of employment. Personal conduct \ndisqualifying condition 16 (f), applies. \nNone of the personal conduct mitigating conditions apply. Applicant\u2019s policy \nviolation is not minor. He intentionally violated company policy on multiple occasions. \nHe dismissed his employer\u2019s policy aimed at ensuring a safe work environment in favor \nof his personal preferences. Given this behavior, there is concern that Applicant could \ntreat the rules pertaining the protecting and handling of classified information in a similar \nmanner. Accordingly, the circumstances surrounding his 2014 termination continue to \nraise doubt about his security worthiness. \nWhole-Person Concept \nApplicant has failed to mitigate the alcohol consumption and personal conduct \nconcerns alleged in the SOR. Accordingly, doubts remain about his current security \nworthiness. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-person factors \nat AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol misuse and resulting criminal record is \nextensive. His decision to drive a vehicle as well as his decision to consume alcohol \nduring duty hours, despite being warned not to do so, suggests a disregard for rules and \nregulations that is incompatible with the responsibilities and expectations of a clearance \nholder. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Alcohol Consumption  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

(Item \n2 at 3)   \n \n \nDuring a background interview in May 2019, Applicant stated his financial status \nwas \u201chealthy.\u201d (Item 4 at 5) He told the interviewer that he contributes to his 401(k) \npension plan and stays on a budget. He has not participated in financial counseling. (Id.)  \n \n \nBased on an April 2019 credit bureau report (CBR), the SOR alleged six delinquent \ndebts that totaled about $32,000 and arose between 2010 and 2016. Applicant stated \nthat some debts were cancelled, that he received Internal Revenue Forms1099-C for \nthem, and he paid taxes on them. (Item 2 at 3) He did not submit documentation \nconfirming those assertions.  \n \n \nApplicant submitted a February 2020 CBR to show that many of the alleged \ndelinquent debts are no longer listed by that agency. (AE A) However, that CBR still \nshows the delinquent debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d for $1,129 , and lists his last payment as \nJune 2013.  \n\n \n \n \n \n3 \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions, which \nare useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states that an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.  \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that an adverse decision shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of \nthe applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n4 \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. Financial distress can also be caused by or \nexacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of \npersonnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise sensitive information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nsensitive information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding sensitive \ninformation. (See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes three disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \n \n  \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n \n  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n \n  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \n \n \nIn about 2010, Applicant began accumulating debts related to his son\u2019s medical \nconditions, which he was unable to pay. However, later he decided not to pay them and \nrelied on the expiration of the SOL to remove his legal liability for them, demonstrating his \nunwillingness to pay valid debts. The record establishes the above disqualifying \nconditions, requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating \nconditions. \n \nAG \u00b6 20 sets out five conditions that could potentially mitigate financial security \nconcerns under this guideline: \n\n \n \n \n \n5 \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nWith sufficient support from the record evidence, the SOR alleges six delinquent \ndebts totaling about $32,000, which arose over a period of six or seven years. Applicant \ndid not pay or resolve any of the debts and asserts he is no longer legally responsible for \nthem because five of them do not appear on his recent CBR. One debt, from 2013, \ncontinues to appear. He did not provide any evidence to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 \n20(a). Applicant stated that the delinquent debts arose during a period when his son \nexperienced serious mental health problems, for which Applicant did not have insurance. \nThose were conditions largely beyond Applicant\u2019s control. However, Applicant did not \nproduce evidence that he acted responsibly under those conditions. The evidence \nestablishes partial mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b).  \n \nApplicant has not participated in financial counseling, and there is no credible \nevidence that he took responsible actions to recently pay or resolve the alleged delinquent \ndebts. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. He did not provide evidence that he ever attempted to \nmake payments on the debts, including the one that is listed on his 2020 CBR. AG \u00b6 20(d) \ndoes not apply.  \n \nApplicant reported that five of the six delinquent debts alleged in the SOR have \nbeen deleted or no longer appear on his credit report, implying that he is not responsible \nfor them. In order to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(e), Applicant must provide \nevidence that he had a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debts \nor otherwise took actions to resolve the issues. The fact that a creditor has charged off or \ndeleted a debt is not a valid basis to mitigate a debt under AG \u00b6 20(e). \u201cMere evidence \nthat debts no longer appear on credit reports is not reason to believe that they are not \n\n \n \n \n \n6 \nlegitimate or that they have been satisfactorily resolved.\u201d ISCR Case No. 16-02941 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-03747 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Nov. 13, \n2015)). Applicant failed to establish mitigation under this guideline for security concerns \narising from any of the debts.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) \nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security eligibility \nmust include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \nApplicant is a 55-year-old man who served in the U.S. Army for four years. He is \nmarried and has five children. He has been steadily employed since 2010. In or around \n2012, his son began experiencing serious mental health issues that continued for the next \nyear or longer and resulted in expensive medical costs not covered by his insurance. \nWhile paying some of those costs, he was unable to maintain payments on other living \nexpenses and debts. Subsequently, six delinquent debts accumulated and totaled about \n$32,000 at the time the SOR issued. Instead of resolving any of those debts, he chose to \nallow the SOL to expire on his legal responsibility, and at least five of the six debts have \nbeen removed from his 2020 CBR.  \n \nGenerally, the Appeal Board has held that debts that are beyond the statute of \nlimitations for collections cannot be mitigated solely because they are not collectable. \n(See ISCR Case No. 08-01122 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 9, 2009); ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at \n5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008); ADP Case No. 07-13041 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, 2008); ISCR \nCase No. 07-11814 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2008); ADP Case No. 06-14616 at 3 (App. \nBd. Oct. 18, 2007). \n\n \n \n \n \n7 \nThe Appeal Board further noted that reliance upon legal defenses such as the \nstatute of limitations does not necessarily demonstrate prudence, honesty, and reliability. \nIt has limited probative value in addressing [security] concerns arising out of financial \nissues. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). A [security] \nadjudication is not aimed at collecting an applicant\u2019s personal debts. Rather it is aimed at \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness to make a decision \nabout the applicant\u2019s [security] eligibility. \n \nApplicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion. There is insufficient evidence to \novercome the security concerns raised by his financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n  \n   AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.f: \n   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nNational security eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The \nSOR further informed Applicant that, based on information available to the government, \nDoD adjudicators could not make the preliminary affirmative finding it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 6, 2020, and requested that his case be \ndecided by an administrative judge without a hearing. (Item 2.) On May 22, 2020, \nDepartment Counsel submitted the Department=s written case. A complete copy of the \nfile of relevant material (FORM), consisting of Items 1 to 5, was provided to Applicant, \nwho received the file on June 15, 2020.  \n \n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant was given 30 days from receipt of the FORM to file objections and \nsubmit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. He submitted additional \nmaterial, which is identified as Applicant Exhibit A and admitted without objection. The \ncase was assigned to me on July 28, 2020.

Department Counsel \nprovided a seven-page summary of the facts, supported by 14 Government documents \npertaining to Pakistan, collectively identified as Item 6. The documents provide \nelaboration and context for the summary. I take administrative notice of the facts \nincluded in the U.S. Government reports. They are limited to matters of general \nknowledge, not subject to reasonable dispute. They are set out in the Findings of Fact. \n \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nApplicant admitted SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.f. He denied \nallegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.e. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 71-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He is married and \nhas two adult children. Applicant was born in Pakistan in 1949, entered the United \nStates in 1973, and became a naturalized American citizen in 1982. He has a master\u2019s \ndegree. Applicant has been employed by a defense contractor since June 2018. He \ndoes not currently hold a security clearance, but has held one in the past. (Item 3 at \nSections 1-4, 9, and 13B; Applicant Exhibit A.) \n \n \nApplicant worked as a Federal civilian employee from 1982 to 1990, and again \nfrom 2005 to 2012. Applicant worked overseas in the Persian Gulf area from 2005 to \nAugust 2014, and again from September 2015 to January 2018. Applicant returned to \nthe United States full-time in January 2018. (Item 3 at Sections 11 and 13B; Applicant \nExhibit A.) \n \n \n1.a. Applicant has two brothers and four sisters. Except for one brother, all of his \nremaining family now lives in the United States. His brother retired from the Pakistani \nArmy as an officer in 2017. Applicant has not seen this brother since he returned to the \nUnited States in January 2018. His only contact with this brother since then is through \nsocial media.  (Item 2; Item 4; Applicant Exhibit A.)  \n \n \n1.b. The SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s son resided in Saudi Arabia. Applicant \nstated that his son returned to the United States in 2017. The Government conceded \n\n \n3 \n \nthat this allegation has been mitigated. Accordingly, it is found for Applicant. (Item 2; \nFORM at footnote 1.) \n \n \n1.c. The Government alleged that Applicant maintained close and continuing \ncontact with various friends and family members in Pakistan. In this regard Applicant \nstated, \u201cSince 2018, there is ONLY minimal/infrequent contacts with friends and \nrelatives in Pakistan using social media (WhatsApp) for personal greetings.\u201d (Applicant \nExhibit A at 1-2.) \n \n \nThe following three allegations, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f, concern Applicant\u2019s financial \nconnections in Pakistan. For ease of discussion they will be addressed together. At the \ntime the SOR was issued in February 2020, Applicant had cash and property assets in \nPakistan worth between $140,000 and $160,000. This included $22,000 in several bank \naccounts; an apartment owned by Applicant\u2019s wife worth approximately $70,000; and \nproperty that was alleged to be worth $111,000, but due to currency deflation in \nPakistan had been reduced to approximately $70,000. (Item 5.) \n \n \nApplicant submitted documentation from his bank in the United States showing \nthat approximately $100,000 had been remitted from his Pakistani bank. Applicant \nstated that only approximately $20,000 remained in Pakistan as of June 29, 2020, and \nthat amount was in the process of being transferred. (Applicant Exhibit A.) Item 5 \nindicated that Applicant had approximately $601,000 worth of assets in the United \nStates, before transfer of the funds from Pakistan. \n \nPakistan \n \n \nI take administrative notice of the facts set forth in Item 6. Pakistan is a \nparliamentary federal republic, created in 1947 after British India was partitioned when \nthe British government granted India its independence. Pakistan was created for the \nMoslem population of the Indian sub-continent. Its population is about 170 million. After \nSeptember 11, 2001, Pakistan reassessed its relations with the Taliban and supported \nthe U.S. and international coalition in its efforts to remove the Taliban from power. Many \nIslamic extremists and terrorists are known to inhabit parts of Pakistan, leading to a \ngrowth of their insurgency. Although Pakistan has intensified its efforts to deal with the \nviolence and terrorists, the country continues to experience serious problems. The U.S. \nDepartment of State confirms that many border cities are known as safe havens for \nterrorists. Numerous suicide bombings and kidnappings have taken place over the past \nyears. Human rights violations continue to be a significant problem, as killings, torture, \nand disappearances remain prevalent. The Pakistani government maintains domestic \nintelligence surveillance activities. The U.S. government warns Americans against travel \nto Pakistan. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.  \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires that the Government must present sufficient \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe \u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \nclearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \n \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Three are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject \nthe individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or \npersonal conflict of interest. \n \n  \nApplicant is originally from Pakistan and has one family member there. He also \nhas social contact with friends in Pakistan. Applicant had substantial financial assets in \nPakistan. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 including: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \n\n \n6 \n \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s evidence supports the fact that he is a conscientious and patriotic \nAmerican citizen and member of the defense industry. He has demonstrated that, while \nhe is in minimal contact with his single brother in Pakistan, there is no conflict of \ninterest, because his sense of loyalty or obligation to Pakistan is minimal. Further, he \nhas deep and longstanding loyalties to the United States. Applicant moved to the United \nStates in 1973. He was employed by the United States government for many years in \nimportant jobs, many overseas. His wife is an American citizen, and his two children are \nnative-born American citizens. In addition, his other brother and four sisters all live in \nthe United States. Applicant has liquidated almost all of his financial interests in \nPakistan, and submitted evidence that the assets have been moved to the United \nStates. Applicant presented evidence of substantial ties to the United States. Applicant \nhas successfully maintained a security clearance in the past. He can be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States interest. Guideline B is found \nfor Applicant. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \n\n \n7 \n \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but may warrant additional comment.  \n \nApplicant was born in Pakistan, he is an American by choice and worked with the \nUnited States military for many years. His financial assets are in the United States. His \nclosest familial ties are with his wife and children, all of whom are American citizens. His \nremaining contacts in Pakistan are infrequent. He can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the United States due to his longstanding ties here.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for national security eligibility and a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the Foreign Influence \nsecurity concerns.  \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.f: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n________________________ \nWilford H.

(Item 4.) On February 28, 2020, the Department of \nDefense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). (Item 1.) The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of Defense on June 8, \n2017. \nApplicant signed his Answer to the SOR (Answer) on March 13, 2020, and \nrequested his case be decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing.

He elected not to submit any \nadditional material. The case was assigned to me on July 7, 2020. Based upon a review \nof the pleadings and exhibits, national security eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 38, married but separated, and has one child. Applicant served in the \nArmy from 2001 until 2004, when he received an Honorable Discharge. He has been \ncontinuously employed since leaving the Army in 2004. He is currently employed by a \ndefense contractor and seeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his \nemployment. (Item 3 at Sections 13A, 15, 17, and 18.) \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe Government alleged in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for \nclearance because he is financially overextended and therefore potentially unreliable, \nuntrustworthy, or at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nApplicant admitted all 33 allegations in the SOR under this paragraph. The total \namount of money Applicant allegedly owed on all SOR-listed debts is approximately \n$34,802. Delinquent medical debts comprise $14,516 worth of this debt. The existence \nand amount of the debts is supported by credit reports dated October 20, 2018; \nNovember 25, 2019; and April 22, 2020. (Items 6, 7, and 8.) \nApplicant stated in his Answer at 5, \u201cI have made some financial mistakes in the \npast, as has everyone at some point in their life. It is a slow process, but I am confident \nthat I can achieve the goal.\u201d Applicant further stated in his Answer that he is working \nwith the VA to have some of his medical debts paid for by the Government, and he now \nhas a health insurance plan through his employer. \n1  Department Counsel submitted eight Items in support of the SOR allegations. Item 5 is inadmissible. It \nis the summary of an unsworn interview of Applicant conducted by an interviewer from the Office of \nPersonnel Management on July 16. 2019. Applicant did not adopt the summary as his own statement, or \notherwise certify it to be accurate. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20, this Report of Investigation (ROI) summary \nis inadmissible in the Government\u2019s case in chief in the absence of an authenticating witness. (See \nExecutive Order 10865 \u00a7 5.) In light of Applicant\u2019s admissions, Item 5 is also cumulative. Applicant is not \nlegally trained and might not have understood Department Counsel\u2019s FORM commentary, which \ndescribed the potential admissibility of Item 5. I therefor reviewed it for any potentially mitigating \ninformation that Applicant might have thought would be considered. Any such mitigating information will \nbe discussed later in this decision. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe debts in the SOR range from $29 (SOR 1.p) to $10,921 (SOR 1.a). Applicant \nsubmitted no evidence showing that he has made payment arrangements with any of \nthe creditors named in the SOR, even the smallest. While he admitted allegation 1.g, he \nadded that this is a debt he might have a reason to dispute. He further stated in his \nAnswer that he is working with the creditor in allegation 1.gg, to reach a resolution. \nApplicant submitted no documented financial information, such as a budget, from which \nto determine whether he is now financially stable. Applicant did not submit any evidence \nconcerning the quality of his job performance. He submitted no character references or \nother evidence tending to establish good judgment, trustworthiness, or reliability. I was \nunable to evaluate his credibility, demeanor, or character in person since he elected to \nhave his case decided without a hearing. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant=s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant=s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge=s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG & 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the Awhole-person concept.@ The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG & 2(b) \nrequires that, AAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.@ In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nAccording to Directive & E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive & E3.1.15, \u201cThe \napplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201cAny determination under this \norder adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified \nor sensitive information).   \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personal security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant, based on documentary evidence, has 33 delinquent accounts totaling \napproximately $34,802 that he could not or chose not to resolve. The evidence is \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, shifting the burden to \nApplicant to demonstrate mitigation. \nThe guideline includes five conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s debt problems have been in existence for many years. In addition, he \nprovided no information to show that his current financial situation is stable. AG \u00b6 20(a) \ndoes not apply. \nApplicant has been continuously employed since he entered the Army in 2001. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not applicable. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), (d), and (e) do not have applicability to the facts of this case. \nIt is Applicant\u2019s burden to show with sufficient evidence that he has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns of his financial situation. He has not done so, for the reasons set forth \nin this decision. Paragraph 1 is found against Applicant. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant=s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant=s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG & 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual=s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG & 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties are \nrecent, voluntary, and occurred when he was a mature adult. Rehabilitation was not \ndemonstrated, nor was unlikelihood of recurrence. Overall, the record evidence as \ndescribed above leaves me with questions and substantial doubts as to Applicant=s \nsuitability for national security eligibility and a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising under the guideline for \nFinancial Considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.gg:  \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on April 18, 2018. On \nMarch 17, 2020, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline B. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by \nthe DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on April 3, 2020, and requested a decision on the \nwritten record without a hearing. On May 26, 2020, the Government sent Applicant a \ncomplete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), including \ndocuments identified as Items 1 through 6. He was given an opportunity to submit a \ndocumentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, extenuation, mitigation, or \nexplanation to the FORM and submit any additional information. He received the FORM \non June 1, 2020, and did not respond.

Items 4 and 5 are admitted into evidence as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2. \nItem 6 is appended to the record as Administrative Exhibit (AE) I. The case was \nassigned to me on July 21, 2020. \nProcedural Matters \nGE 2 was not authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. However, I \nconclude that Applicant waived any objection to GE 2. The Government included in the \nFORM a prominent notice advising Applicant of his right to object to the admissibility of \nGE 2 on the ground that it was not authenticated. Applicant was also notified that if he \ndid not raise any objection to GE 2 in his response to the FORM, or if he did not \nrespond to the FORM, he could be considered to have waived any such objection, and \nthat GE 2 could be considered as evidence in his case. Applicant received the FORM, \nincluding a copy of GE 2. He did not respond to the FORM or otherwise object to GE 2. \nAE I is the Government\u2019s request for me to take administrative notice of certain \nfacts about Venezuela that are supported by source documents, which are official U.S. \nGovernment publications. Without objection by Applicant, I have taken administrative \nnotice of the facts contained in the request. Several of the source documents proffered \nin AE I have been recently updated. To ensure that I consider the most current political \nconditions in Venezuela, I sua sponte appended the updated documents to the record \nas AE II and have taken administrative notice of the facts contained therein. The \nupdated documents did not contain facts that affected either the relative positions of the \nparties or my decision. The facts administratively noticed from AE I and AE II will not be \nrepeated verbatim in this decision, but are summarized in the Administrative Notice \nsection, below.

They all reside in the state of Bolivar, \nVenezuela. His father, mother-in-law, and father-in-law are deceased. Applicant\u2019s \nmother is a homemaker. None of his siblings are employed by the Venezuelan \ngovernment. He communicates by either telephone or email with his: mother, weekly; \nsister, monthly; and brothers, quarterly. He travelled to Venezuela in 2011 and 2015 to \nvisit his family. (GE 1 at 26-30, 32; GE 2 at 4) \nApplicant and his wife own an apartment in Venezuela that they purchased in \n1991. This was their primary residence when they lived in Venezuela. The purchase \nprice was approximately $40,000. Applicant is not sure what the current value of the \napartment is, but estimates that it has very little value due to the poor economy in \nVenezuela. The apartment is currently vacant. He does not intend to sell the property at \nthis time, but may consider doing so if and when the economy improves. The apartment \nis not important to Applicant\u2019s overall financial situation. (GE 1 at 31; GE 2 at 3) \nApplicant has sent money to his mother in the approximate amount of $400 per \nquarter for the past 30 years. This money helps with her day-to-day expenses. He \nintends to continue these payments for the foreseeable future. He has owned his home \nin the United States since 2006. The record did not contain information concerning any \nother U.S. assets. (GE 1 at 12-14, 32; GE 2 at 3-4) \nAdministrative Notice \nVenezuela is legally a multiparty, constitutional republic. However, for more than \na decade, political power has been concentrated in a single party with an authoritarian \nexecutive. \nThe United States, along with nearly sixty other countries, recognizes Interim \nPresident Juan Guaido and considers the Venezuelan National Assembly (NA), which \nhe currently leads, to be the only legitimate federal institution, according to the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nVenezuelan Constitution. The United States works with Interim President Juan Guaido \nand his team on a number of areas of mutual concern, including humanitarian and \nmigration issues, health issues, security, anti-narcotrafficking initiatives, and \nreestablishment of the rule of law. The United States proposed a Democratic Transition \nFramework in 2020 as a guide to help Venezuelan society achieve a peaceful, \ndemocratic transition. \nVenezuela\u2019s previous presidents, the late Hugo Chavez (1999-2013) and Nicolas \nMaduro (2013-2019), defined themselves in large part through their opposition to the \nUnited States, regularly criticizing and sowing disinformation about the U.S. \ngovernment, its policies, and its relations with Latin America. Maduro, who was not \nreelected via free and fair elections, clings to power through the use of force. Maduro\u2019s \nformer regime has consistently violated and abused the human rights and dignity of the \ncountry\u2019s citizens, plundered its natural resources, and driven a once-prosperous nation \ninto economic ruin with authoritarian rule and ruinous economic policies. Maduro\u2019s \nthugs have reportedly engaged in killings and physical abuse, detained political \nopponents, and severely interfered with the exercise of freedom of expression, all in a \nbrutal effort to retain power. \nMaduro and his associates use criminal activities to help maintain their \nillegitimate hold on power, fostering a permissive environment for known terrorist \ngroups, including dissidents of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC-D), \nthe Colombian-origin National Liberation Army (ELN), and Hezbollah sympathizers. \nFinancial ties with FARC-D, ELN, and Venezuelan paramilitary groups facilitate the \npublic corruption and graft schemes of the regime to include members of the armed \nforces. \nSignificant human rights issues exist in Venezuela including: unlawful or arbitrary \nkillings, including extrajudicial killings by security forces of the former Maduro regime, \nincluding regime-sponsored armed groups; forced disappearances; torture by security \nforces; arbitrary detention by security forces; harsh and life-threatening prison \nconditions; political prisoners; unlawful interference with privacy; and lack of judicial \nindependence. The former Maduro regime restricted free expression and the press by \nroutinely blocking signals and interfering with the operations of, or shutting down, \nprivately owned television, radio, and other media outlets. Libel, incitement, and \ninaccurate reporting were subject to criminal charges. The former Maduro regime used \nviolence to repress peaceful demonstrations and repressed freedom of assembly. Other \nissues included: intimidation, harassment, and abuse of NA members, including denial \nof due process and parliamentary immunity; pervasive corruption and impunity among \nall Maduro-aligned security forces and in other national and state regime offices, \nincluding at the highest levels; trafficking in persons; violence against indigenous \npersons; and the worst forms of child labor, which the former regime made minimal \nefforts to eliminate. \nVenezuela has one of the highest number of violent deaths in the region and in \nthe world.

In 2020, anti-corruption watchdog \nTransparency International rated Venezuela 173rd out of 180 countries in its Corruption \nPerception Index, rating Venezuela less corrupt than only Yemen, Syria, South Sudan, \nand Somalia. Corruption takes many forms, from motorists bribing traffic police to \nallegations of bribes and kickbacks in the allocation of government contracts. Corruption \nappears to have reached record levels in recent years, with government institutions \nbecoming increasingly criminal in nature, including activities such as rampant corruption \nin the state-controlled food distribution, active black market dollar trading, gasoline \nsmuggling, drug trafficking, illegal gold mining, and other activities. \nThe U.S. Department of State continues to assess Venezuela at Level 4 (out of \n4), which indicates that travelers should not travel to the country due to crime, civil \nunrest, poor health infrastructure, kidnapping, and arbitrary arrest and detention of U.S. \ncitizens. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at \n3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition \nby substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a \nmitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. \n(ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe following are potentially relevant disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \nand \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's \nobligation to protect classified or sensitive information or technology and \nthe individual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information or technology. \nApplicant\u2019s close familial ties to his mother, sister, and two brothers establish AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) based on the heightened risk associated with Venezuela and the \npotential conflict of interest that arises from his connection to them. A heightened risk is \nassociated with Venezuela due to Maduro\u2019s continued repressive, authoritarian, and \nanti-American regime which supports known terrorist groups. Moreover, violent crime, \ncorruption, drug trafficking, and human-rights abuses are prevalent. Applicant bears the \nburden of persuasion to mitigate these concerns. (ISCR Case No. 99-0532 at 7 (App. \nBd. Dec. 15, 2000) \nApplication of AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) is not a comment on an applicant\u2019s patriotism \nbut merely an acknowledgment that people may act in unpredictable ways when faced \nwith choices that could be important to a loved one, such as a family member. (ISCR \nCase No. 08-10025 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2009). Family relationships can involve \nmatters of influence or obligation. (ISCR Case No. 02-04786 (App. Bd. Jun. 27, 2003). \nThe following are potentially relevant mitigating conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that \ncountry are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government \nand the interests of the United States; \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, government, or \ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the United States, that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \nAG \u00b6 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation. \nFor the reasons set out in the discussion of AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) above, I cannot \nconclude that it is unlikely that Applicant will be placed in a position of having to choose \nbetween the interests of his family and that of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(a) is not \nestablished. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has established strong ties to the United States, where he has lived \nwith his family for over 28 years. He has owned a home in the United States for 14 \nyears. However, the record contains insufficient facts to overcome the equally strong \nties that he has to his family in Venezuela, who are at a heightened risk of coercion or \npressure from a foreign government. Under these circumstances, I cannot conclude that \nApplicant could be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterest. AG \u00b6 8(b) is not established. \nNone of Applicant\u2019s familial relationships are casual; nor is his contact with them \ninfrequent. There remains a potential risk for foreign influence or exploitation. AG \u00b6 8(c) \nis not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nAG, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. In evaluating \nthe relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, an administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline B in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors AG \u00b6 2(d). I weighed the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline B, and evaluated all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person and the heightened risk associated with Venezuela. Applicant has not \nmitigated the security concerns raised by his close familial ties to citizens and residents \nof Venezuela. Accordingly, I conclude that he has not carried his burden of showing that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Applicant pays his friend 5 to 10 percent of his monthly pension for his assistance. \nDuring his August 2019 background interview with a government investigator, Applicant \nstated that he was not willing to give up this pension because he uses it to support his \nfamily in the United States. (Item 5) \nApplicant owns an apartment in Iraq with an estimated value of $40,000 to \n$50,000. He said he owns it on behalf of his spouse and sister-in-law, who cannot legally \nown the property. To date, his wife and sister-in-law have not chosen to sell the property. \n(Item 5) Applicant rents his home in the United States. (Item 4) He did not submit any \nevidence pertinent to his financial interests in the United States. \nIraq \nI have taken administrative notice of facts contained in U.S. Government \ndocuments concerning the Federal Republic of Iraq, as outlined in Item 7, including the \nfollowing: Iraq faces many challenges fueled by sectarian and ethnic divisions. Numerous \nterrorist groups are increasingly active throughout Iraq. The Islamic State of Iraq and the \nLevant (ISIL or Islamic State) controls some of the country\u2019s territory. Threats of \nkidnapping and violence are high, and the Department of State warns U.S. citizens that \nall travel to Iraq should be avoided. Additionally, human-rights-related problems including \ndisappearances, torture, denial of fair public trial, and limits on freedom of expression, \nare present.  \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \n \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201c[a]ny determination \nunder this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is set out in AG \n\u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline describes conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying under AG \u00b6 7.

However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, that factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. \n15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \nIraq has significant numbers of internal anti-western terrorists who operate openly \nand contrary to U.S. interests. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s close connections to a friend and \nthree family members, who have ties to the Iraqi government, generate significantly \nheightened risks of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion \nunder AG \u00b6 7(a). \nApplicant has ongoing contacts with his father, two sisters, and a friend, who are \ncitizens and residents of Iraq. He visited his family for three weeks in 2019 to see his \nfather. He has ongoing contact with a friend, who sends Applicant his monthly pension \ncheck from the Iraqi government. Applicant also legally owns an apartment in Iraq. These \npersonal and financial relationships create a heightened risk of foreign pressure or \nattempted exploitation because terrorists or insurgents in Iraq engage in behaviors that \nare hostile to the United States\u2019 interests. Those connections also create a potential for \nconflict of interest between Applicant\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or \ntechnology and his desire to help family members living in Iraq or protect his financial \ninterests. The evidence is sufficient to raise a disqualification under AG \u00b6 7(b). \nSince 2017, Applicant has received a $5,400 annual pension from the Iraqi \ngovernment, which he does not want to relinquish. Although he said that his wife and \nsister-in-law own his apartment in Iraq, he has legal ownership of the property, which is \nworth $40,000 to $50,000. Those two financial interests are sufficient to raise disqualifying \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 7(f). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAfter the Government produced sufficient evidence of those disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant to rebut them or otherwise prove mitigation. \nFour mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially applicable to the disqualifying \nsecurity concerns based on these facts: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest;  \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not be \nused effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \nConsidered in light of the anti-western insurgent threats in Iraq, Applicant did not \nsufficiently demonstrate that it is unlikely he could be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of a foreign individual or government and those of the \nUnited States due to his personal and financial ties to Iraq. In fact, he noted that one of \nthe reasons he immigrated to the United States was because he and his family were not \nsafe in Iraq, and he had been kidnapped in 2007. \nApplicant has monthly contact with his father, who worked for the Iraqi government \nand now collects a pension. He has annual contact with his two sisters, who work for the \nIraqi government. He has monthly contact with a friend, who transmits Applicant\u2019s pension \ncheck to him. Applicant has legitimate and appropriately close relationships with those \nfamily members and friend, and also a strong interest in protecting them. His \ncommunication and contact with them are ongoing. Accordingly, he failed to establish the \nmitigating conditions set out in AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and (c). \nThe evidence also fails to establish sufficient mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(b). A key \nfactor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and longstanding relationships and \nloyalties in the United States.\u201d The record does not contain persuasive documentation as \nto the extent of Applicant\u2019s personal and financial connections to the United States. He \nand his family arrived here in August 2010 and became citizens in 2016, about four years \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nago. He rents his home. He has worked for private companies periodically, and also \nexperienced periods of unemployment. While these facts demonstrate a growing \nconnection to the United States, they do not outweigh his 40 years of history and ongoing \nfamilial relationships with Iraq. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant\u2019s \nU.S. ties are sufficiently deep and longstanding that he can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest involving his family in Iraq in favor of the U.S. interests. Accordingly, he \ndid not mitigate the foreign influence security concerns under this condition. \nApplicant did not provide information about his finances, the value of his assets, or \nproperty interests he has in the United States. Consequently, there is insufficient evidence \nto determine whether his assets in the United States sufficiently outweigh his Iraqi assets, \nand are unlikely to result in a conflict of interest that could be used to pressure him. He \ndid state that he needed his Iraqi pension to help support his family in the United States. \nHe did not establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 8(f). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nThe foreign influence security concerns do not arise from any questionable \nconduct by Applicant, but rather circumstances that are the normal results of his familial \nties and years of living in Iraq. There is no evidence that he has ever taken any action \nthat could cause potential harm to the United States. However, after weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all pertinent facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole-person, I conclude Applicant failed to sufficiently mitigate the security \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                      \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconcerns pertaining to foreign influence. The significant potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress remains unmitigated.

Applicant responded to the FORM \non June 12, 2020, and submitted an eighteen page document, referred to as Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit A, which was admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA assigned the \ncase to me on July 7, 2020. Items 1 through 5 are admitted into evidence and \nhereinafter referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 5. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 34 years old. He is married a second time. He has three children. \nHe has a high school diploma and a certificate of completion of the Automotive \nTechnology Program. \nHe holds the position of heavy equipment operator and is \nseeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.   \nThe SOR identified three allegations under this guideline concerning Applicant\u2019s \nfailure to file his Federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2007, 2008, 2009, \n2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017; and a delinquent medical debt \nthat was placed for collection.  In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admits allegations \n1.a. and 1.b, and he denied allegation 1.c., asserting that the debt has been paid.  \nApplicant has no prior military service.  He has primarily worked as an automobile \ntechnician from September 2005 to July 2011; and from September 2011 to the present.  \n1.a., and 1.b. \nApplicant explained that during his marriage to his ex-wife, from \nSeptember 2006 to February 2014, she would file their income taxes each year claiming \nonly herself and their children in order to receive a tax refund. She would keep the \nrefund for her spending. Instead of filing and owing taxes, Applicant simply did not file \nincome tax returns. Applicant stated, \u201cI failed to take adequate action to curb her [his \nwife\u2019s] behavior.\u201d (Government Exhibit 2.) For eleven years, Applicant allowed her to \ncontinue these false tax filings during and after their marriage. Applicant was aware \nthat her false tax filings would cause him future tax problems. Applicant and his wife \ndivorced in 2014. At some point, due to his ex-wife\u2019s drug addiction, Applicant filed for \ncustody of his children. The divorce and child custody matters caused Applicant serious \nfinancial hardship which delayed his ability to address his tax issues. In May 2017, at \nthe conclusion of the child custody case, Applicant was awarded full legal and physical \ncustody of their two children. At that time he began to explore his options on how to \naddress his tax issues. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant provided several documents that are not definitive concerning his \ndelinquent tax indebtedness to the state.  A copy of a check to the state tax authorities \ndated November 26, 2019, shows that he made a payment in the amount of $373.  \n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)  An installment bill from the state dated February 18, 2020, \nreflects a balance due of $3,186.19, with a required monthly payment of $102.42.   \nApplicant\u2019s bank records show that he has made at least four payments toward this \ndebt.  (Government Exhibit 2.)  He also submitted a remittance notice showing a refund \nof $732.39 was issued to him on May 19, 2020 by the state.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.)  \nApplicant has also filed his 2018 income tax returns.  Applicant submitted a payment \nagreement which sets forth a payment plan of $191.35 per month for 36 months, the \nfirst payment being due on June 15, 2020.   \n \n \nRegarding his federal back taxes, Applicant submitted a bill from the IRS dated \nFebruary 17, 2020, indicating that he owes $1,146.07 for tax year 2017. (Applicant\u2019s \nExhibit A.) Applicant stated in his response to the FORM that he initially wanted to \nnegotiate a payment plan of $150 monthly, but the IRS requested $250 monthly, which \nhe agreed upon.  At that time he was waiting for the finalized agreement from the IRS in \norder to begin this payment plan.  (Government Exhibit 2.)  There is nothing in the \nrecord that confirms the total amount of back taxes owed to the federal government.       \n \n \n1.c. A delinquent medical debt in the amount of $114 that was sent to collection \nwas paid in full on June 26, 2019, in the amount of $120.89.

(Government Exhibit 5 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.) In \nFebruary 2019, when Applicant had completed payments for their services, the tax relief \ncompany began working to resolve Applicant\u2019s tax problems. Applicant contends that \nhe was advised by the tax relief program that he did not have to file his state or Federal \nincome tax returns for tax years 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013. \nApplicant submitted no documentation for this assertion. Applicant states that he was \nrequired to file his state and Federal income tax for tax years 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, \nand 2018. \nHe provided copies of those income tax returns, which were filed in \nNovember 2019. (Government Exhibit 2.) Applicant was told by the tax relief company \nthat he would owe approximately $3,000 for each tax year that he did not file a tax \nreturn. They are currently negotiating a settlement with the tax authorities to help \nApplicant begin a repayment program. \nApplicant admits his mistakes of the past and states that they will not be \nduplicated. He states that this tax situation has caused him much grief, anxiety and \nmoney. He also states that he started rectifying his tax situation well before he applied \nfor a government position.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are possibly applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as \nrequired or the fraudulent filing of the same. \nApplicant failed to file state or Federal income tax returns for eleven years, from \n2007 through 2017. During this period, he knew his spouse was improperly filing her \ntax returns in order to obtain a tax refund. For over ten years, Applicant did nothing to \ncorrect this situation. In fact, he continued to allow her to do this during his marriage \nand even three years post-divorce. \nThis shows poor judgment and unreliability. \nApplicant has not acted responsibly under the circumstances, nor is he the type of \nindividual to be trusted with the national secrets. There is nothing in the record to \nmitigate this violation of the laws and there is no excuse for this misconduct. Applicant \nhas not demonstrated the high degree of judgment, reliability and trustworthiness \nrequired to hold a security clearance. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAlthough Applicant went through a divorce, and a lengthy and expensive child \ncustody case, he is not excused from failing to file his income tax returns for eleven \nyears. Applicant knew that his wife was submitting false tax filings to both the state and \nFederal tax authorities and did nothing about it. \nAs a result, Applicant has no \nmeaningful track record of resolving his tax obligations or following rules and \nregulations. \nApplicant has made some recent changes in his life to correct his past income \ntax problems. He is commended for filing some of his delinquent income tax returns \nand for beginning to pay his back taxes. He has filed his state and Federal income \ntaxes for tax years 2014 through 2018. He states that he is no longer required to file \nreturns for tax years 2007 through 2013, but provides no supporting documentation \nfrom the tax authorities for the basis of this contention. He states that he is resolving his \nstate tax liability, and is in the process of entering into a payment plan with the Federal \ngovernment to resolve that tax liability.  He has also paid his delinquent medical bill. \nDespite these recent efforts, by failing to file his income tax returns in the first \nplace, Applicant has participated in a fraudulent scheme, and has created a situation \nthat imposes an undue burden on the taxing authorities. He has been completely \nirresponsible under the law. Applicant has not demonstrated a track record of diligence, \nresponsibility, or even common sense. In fact, his past record shows poor judgment, \nunreliability and untrustworthiness. He has failed to show that he has earned the \nprivilege to access to classified information, or that he will abide by the rules and \nregulations required of him while holding a security clearance. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a., and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c.: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

On July 22, 2019, the Defense Counterintelligence and \nSecurity Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued her a set of \ninterrogatories. Applicant responded to those interrogatories on October 26, 2019. On \nApril 13, 2020, the DCSA CAF issued her a Statement of Reasons (SOR) under Executive \nOrder (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and \nmodified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) (December 10, 2016), effective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand detailed reasons why the DCSA adjudicators were unable to find that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. \nThe SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nIn an unsworn and undated statement, supplemented by an e-mail, dated June 15, \n2020, Applicant responded to the SOR and elected to have her case decided on the \nwritten record in lieu of a hearing.

Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete \nand thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, \nI make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving \nas a subcontract administrator with her current employer since December 2018. She \npreviously worked as a programs purchasing manager from December 2013 until \nDecember 2018. From January 2005 until February 2017, she was a part-time office \nmanager for a business that she and her husband owned. While her high school \neducational background was not reported, she received an associate\u2019s degree in 2012. \nShe has never served with the U.S. military. She has never held a security clearance. \nApplicant was married and divorced in 1995, and remarried in 2009, and again divorced \nin 2017. She has one child, born in 1993. \nFinancial Considerations \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial issues discussed below can \nbe found in the following exhibits: Item 2 (Answer to the SOR, dated June 15, 2020); Item \n3 (SF 86, dated January 14, 2019); Item 4 (Enhanced Subject Interview, dated February \n27, 2019); and Item 5 (Responses to Interrogatories, dated October 26, 2019). \nAs of June 15, 2020, when she answered the SOR, Applicant had failed to file her \nfederal income tax returns for the tax years 2016, 2017, and 2018, and she still owed the \nInternal Revenue Service (IRS) approximately $12,868 in unpaid 2015 income taxes, \naccrued interest, and accrued penalty.

She claimed \nthat she had contacted a tax relief company for help in resolving her 2015 issues, and \nthat she would start making monthly payments, and anticipated that the unpaid income \ntaxes would be paid within the next 36 months. (Item 3, at 34) With respect to the unfiled \n2016 and 2017 federal income tax returns, she claimed to have filed for an extension for \n2016, but missed the filing date. Both federal income tax returns would be filed either \n\u201csoon\u201d or \u201cvery soon.\u201d (Item 3, at 34) Neither action has yet been taken. \nDuring an interview with an investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) on February 27, 2019, Applicant acknowledged that she had not \npaid the federal income taxes for 2015 through 2017. She claimed to be willing and able \nto pay those federal income taxes, but contended that the 2015 debt was associated with \nher husband\u2019s business and solely that of her husband. She also stated that the federal \nincome tax returns for 2016 and 2017 would be filed during the 2018 tax filing period. \n(Item 4, at 1) Those actions have not been taken. She acknowledged that she never \nfollowed up with the tax relief company for help in resolving her 2015 issues. (Item 4, at \n1) \nWith respect to the unpaid federal income taxes for 2016, 2017, and 2018, \nunalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as discussed by the DOHA \nAppeal Board. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered: (a) to assess an \napplicant's credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant's evidence of extenuation, mitigation, \nor changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant has demonstrated \nsuccessful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative \nGuidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person analysis under \nDirective \u00a7 6.3.).

Applicant\u2019s unalleged and unpaid federal income taxes, \nwill be considered only for the five purposes listed above. \nIn her October 2019 responses to the interrogatories, Applicant acknowledged that \nshe had still not filed the federal income tax returns for 2016, 2017, and 2018. She also \nstated that after the income tax returns are filed, she would start making payments to \ncover any taxes left due. She planned for all actions to be \u201cimplemented\u201d by the end of \nNovember 2019. (Item 5, at 2) As of October 30, 2020, because Applicant failed to \nrespond to the FORM, she has offered no evidence to indicate that those federal income \ntax returns have yet been filed, or the payments made. \nAlthough Applicant claimed to be willing and able to pay her federal income taxes, \nit is not known what her current financial resources may be because she did not report \nher current net monthly income; monthly expenses; and any monthly remainder that might \nbe available for discretionary spending or savings. There is no evidence of a budget. \nThere is no evidence of financial counseling. \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)) \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file her federal income tax returns for the \ntax years 2016, 2017, and 2018, and failed to pay approximately $12,868 in 2015 federal \nincome taxes. She made no assertion that her failure to pay her income taxes was due \nto an inability to do so. Instead, she claimed to be willing and able to pay her federal \nincome taxes. As of October 30, 2020, none of those income tax returns had been filed, \nand the 2015 income tax had not been paid. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(b), 19(c), and 19(f) have been \nestablished. AG \u00b6 19(a) has not been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) minimally applies, but none of the other mitigating conditions apply. A \ndebt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can \napplicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, \ncan be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d (ISCR \nCase No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). The nature, frequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s continuing \nfinancial issues, and her failure to voluntarily and timely resolve those delinquent federal \nincome tax issues for several years, despite repeated promises to do so, make it rather \neasy to conclude that they were not infrequent and they are likely to remain unchanged, \nmuch like they have been for several years. Applicant has attributed her financial issues \nessentially to her separation and eventual divorce, but she failed to specify in what ways \nthose factors were largely beyond her control with respect to filing her federal income tax \nreturns or paying her federal income taxes, especially when she has taken no action for \nthree years after her divorce. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his or her financial problems only after being \nplaced on notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the \njudgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no \nimmediate threat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). \nApplicant completed her SF 86 in January 2019; underwent her OPM interview in \nFebruary 2019; completed her responses to the interrogatories in October 2019; the SOR \nwas issued in April 2020; and the FORM was issued in August 2020. Each step of the \nsecurity clearance review process placed her on notice of the significance of the financial \nissues confronting her. With respect to her unfiled federal income tax returns and unpaid \nincome taxes, there is no evidence that Applicant took any action to resolve any of those \nissues. Instead, she made repeated promises to do so, and none of those promises were \nfulfilled. By failing to do so, she does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has observed: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961).  \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). See ISCR Case No. 14-05476 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, \n2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to resolve financial issues in the \nfuture, without further confirmed action, are insufficient.  \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIt should be noted that the Appeal Board has indicated that promises to pay off \ndelinquent debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of paying debts in a \ntimely manner and otherwise acting in a financially responsible manner. (ISCR Case No. \n07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 19, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 3 (App. Bd. \nDec. 1, 1999)) In this instance, there is no evidence, either verbally or supported by \ndocumentation, that Applicant fulfilled her promises or took any good-faith corrective \nactions with respect to her financial issues, to date. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to \nclaim the benefit of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition]. \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001) \nApplicant\u2019s actions, or inaction, under the circumstances cast doubt on her current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. (See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010).) \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006)) \nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving \nas a subcontract administrator with her current employer since December 2018. She \npreviously worked as a programs purchasing manager with another company, and from \nJanuary 2005 until February 2017, she was a part-time office manager for a business that \nshe and her husband owned. She received an associate\u2019s degree in 2012. She \nacknowledged in her SF 86 that she had continuing federal income tax issues. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. Applicant failed to file federal income tax returns for the tax years 2016, 2017, \nand 2018; and she has not paid her federal income taxes for the tax years 2015 through \n2018. As of October 30, 2020, none of those income tax returns had been filed. None of \nthe federal income taxes had been paid, despite Applicant claiming she had the ability to \ndo so. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG 2(d)(9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Due to unusual circumstances largely beyond his control, Applicant \nexperienced financial delinquencies, but mitigated the concern by acting responsibly \nunder the circumstances. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on September 20, \n2018. On April 18, 2020, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of \nReasons (SOR), alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The DOD acted under \nExecutive Order (Ex. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR and requested a decision on the record without a \nhearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on July 14, 2020. \nOn July 17, 2020, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) transmittal letter \nand a complete copy of the FORM, including Government\u2019s Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5, \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwere sent to Applicant.

He did \nnot respond. The DOHA transmittal letter and receipt are marked as Administrative \nExhibit 1. The case was assigned to me on October 29, 2020.  \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges two debts: a $22,136 charged-off vehicle loan \nand a $136,902 charged-off mortgage loan. Applicant admits each of these debts. The \ndelinquent debts are reflected in Applicant\u2019s September 2018 and September 2019 credit \nbureau reports (CBR) (GX 4; GX 5) and discussed in his personal subject interview (PSI). \n(GX 3.) His admissions in his Answer are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant, 46, is a supervisor employed by a defense contractor since June 2018. \nHe has worked for federal contractors since at least January 2008. He served honorably \nin the U.S. Army from January 1993 until July 2002. He received two aerospace \ncertifications in 2012. He was denied a security clearance in 2013 due to financial issues. \nHe married in 1996 and divorced in 2002. Applicant remarried in 2016. He has an adult \nson and a 17-year-old daughter. (GX 2.) \nIn February 2012, Applicant cosigned a vehicle loan for his then-girlfriend. \nApplicant accepted a position to work overseas from October 2012 until October 2014. \nHe left his then-girlfriend in charge of his finances to include his mortgage loan, his truck \nloan, and several consumer accounts. Applicant\u2019s then-girlfriend did not pay the accounts, \nincluding her vehicle loan on which Applicant was the cosigner and Applicant\u2019s mortgage \nloan. (GX 2 through 5.) Applicant\u2019s then-girlfriend routinely withdrew money from \nApplicant\u2019s accounts in the amounts of the account payments that were due which \nresulted in Applicant\u2019s believing that she was timely paying his accounts. (GX 2.) \nApplicant was informed by a relative of his then-girlfriend that his accounts were not being \npaid in about October 2013. Applicant contacted the creditors and began attempting to \nresolve the delinquent accounts. (GX 2; GX 3.) \nThe $22,136 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a is for the charged-off vehicle loan that \nApplicant cosigned for his then-girlfriend. Applicant was contacted in 2015 by an agent \nattempting to recover the vehicle. Applicant explained to the agent that Applicant\u2019s former \ngirlfriend was in possession of the vehicle and that he had not seen the vehicle since he \nreturned from overseas. He provided the agent with as much information as he had to \nassist in the recovery of the vehicle. This debt was charged off to profit and loss in July \n2017. (GX 2; GX 4.) \nUpon learning that his accounts were delinquent, Applicant contacted his \nmortgage-loan lender and was informed that his loan was in foreclosure. He attempted to \nresolve the account but was informed by the lender that it was too late to stop the \nforeclosure process. The $136,902 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b was charged off to profit \nand loss in July 2017.

He resolved the \nmajority of these accounts in 2013 and the final outstanding account in March 2017. (GX \n2; GX 4.) \nApplicant purchased his current house in June 2018 and is current on his mortgage \nloan with no record of any late payments. He is current on all his open accounts, including \nhis child support payments, a credit card, and several consumer accounts. He lives within \nhis means and has not incurred any delinquent debt since 2013. (GX 4; GX 5.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe record evidence establishes two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations\u201d). The following mitigating conditions under this guideline are potentially \napplicable: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation...) and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems arose in 2012 under unusual circumstances and \nwere due to conditions that were largely beyond his control. Applicant misplaced his trust \nin his former girlfriend which resulted in numerous accounts of Applicant\u2019s becoming \ndelinquent, including the two debts alleged in the SOR. Upon learning that his accounts \nwere not being paid by his former girlfriend, Applicant acted responsibly by contacting his \ncreditors and resolving the majority of his delinquent accounts in 2013. He contacted his \nmortgage-loan lender but was unsuccessful in preventing the foreclosure. He provided \ninformation to the agent attempting to recover the vehicle that Applicant cosigned for his \nformer girlfriend. He has continued to act responsibly by living within his means, \nremaining current on all his open accounts, and by not incurring any additional delinquent \ndebts since 2013. The two SOR debts have been charged off to profit and loss and are \nunlikely to be sources of vulnerability to coercion or exploitation. His current mortgage \nlender clearly determined that lending money to Applicant was an acceptable risk.  \nThe unusual circumstances under which Applicant\u2019s debts arose are unlikely to \nrecur and do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nThe age of his debts and his established pattern of overall management of his finances \nsince 2013 are indicative of a responsible person who can be entrusted with access to \nclassified information. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but I \nhave also considered the following: \nApplicant served honorably in the U.S. Army for over nine years. He has not \nincurred any delinquent debt since 2013 and clearly lives within his means. The denial of \nApplicant\u2019s previous security clearance in 2013 occurred in the midst of Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial difficulties that he has since resolved. I am confident that Applicant will continue \nhis efforts to maintain financial stability. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. Accordingly, I conclude \nhe has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStephanie C. Hess \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

He stated in his \nanswer to the SOR that the accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g through 1.p have been \nconsolidated into one account, and he is making payments. In his FORM response, he \nprovided a copy of a budget that includes a payment of $193. He did not provide evidence \nof any other past payments or that he has been making his budgeted payment. The \ndocument from the creditor shows that the past due amount is zero and the current \nbalance owed is $46,992. It appears the creditor has agreed to accept minimal payments. \n(Item 2, 5; AE A, D) \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he stated that he was offered a settlement \nagreement from the creditor for the debt in \u00b6 1.a ($20,003) if he made consistent \npayments for eight months. In his FORM response he provided a copy of an agreement \ndated June 2020, which requires monthly payments of $100. The document shows a \nbalance of $19,803, so presumably Applicant has made two payments. His November \n2019 credit report shows the last activity on this debt was in 2015.

He stated in his FORM \nresponse that he is making an effort to arrange payment plans and agreements for his \ndelinquent debts. (AE D) \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18:  \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts that began accumulating from \napproximately 2015 and have not been paid or resolved. There is sufficient evidence to \nsupport the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant admitted he owed many of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. He \ndenied his student loans were delinquent. He failed to take action to resolve his delinquent \ndebts until after receiving the SOR. Many of the debts have been delinquent since 2015 \nand 2016. He provided minimal evidence to show he has made consistent payments on \nhis debts. For the debts he did make payments, he only provided evidence of one or two \npayments. Applicant has been fully employed since 2014. I am unable to conclude that \nfinancial problems are unlikely to recur and do not cast doubts on Applicant\u2019s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to being young and accruing while he \nwas attending school. Applicant received his technical certificate in 2013. He has been \ngainfully employed since then, more than seven years. Many of his debts became \ndelinquent in 2015 and 2016, after he completed school. The evidence does not \ndemonstrate that his financial problems were due to conditions beyond his control. In \naddition, for the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must also provide evidence that \nhe acted responsibly under the circumstances. He did not provide evidence of actions he \ntook to resolve any of his debts, until after he received the SOR. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not \napply. \nApplicant recently made payment agreements with some creditors, but he did not \nprovide sufficient evidence of recent payments. He also states he has plans to pay certain \naccounts or intends to make future arrangements. His intentions or promises to pay in the \nfuture are not a substitute for reliable past conduct. Applicant has resolved the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.f and AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to this debt. However, there is insufficient evidence at \nthis time that he is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay his overdue. He has not yet \nestablished a consistent payment record. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply to his other debts. \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor assisted him in making a budget, but there is no evidence that he \nhas received financial counseling or that his debts are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) has \nlimited application. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline, F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is 30 years old. Most of his debts have been delinquent since 2015 and \n2016. Although, his student loans do not show they are past-due, the evidence shows he \nonly made $45 worth of payments in 2019 toward a growing debt of now more than \n$46,000. He included the $193 required payment in his budget and other amounts to pay \nhis delinquent debts, but has not submitted proof that he has actually made consistent \npayments toward his debts. Despite being employed since receiving his technical \ncertificate in 2013, he accumulated delinquent debt, which he failed to address until after \nhe received the SOR in 2020. He recently made attempts to make payment arrangements \nwith some of his creditors. However, he has a limited financial track record of consistent \npayments to his creditors. Applicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns raised under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.p: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR (Item 1) alleges under Guideline F that, as of April 2, 2020, Applicant owed a $179,4500 deficiency balance on a foreclosed mortgage loan (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and five medical collection debts of $951 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), $401 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), $103 (SOR \u00b6 1.d), $77 (SOR \u00b6 1.e), and $61 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). When he responded to the SOR, Applicant denied the alleged debts. He indicated that the balances were erroneous, and that the debts had been \u201ccleared by the credit bureau\u201d and no longer appeared on his credit reports. He provided no substantiating documentation but asked the DOD to retrieve his credit report for confirmation. (Item 2.) After considering the FORM (excluding the PSI but including Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR), and Applicant\u2019s rebuttal to the FORM (AE A), I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is a 45-year-old immigrant from Haiti who finished high school in the United States in 1992. He is twice married and divorced and has no children. Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2006 while working as a risk and security administrator in the information technology sector. He began working for a defense contractor in March 2019 and seeks a security clearance for his duties as a senior cyber-security engineer. (Item 3.) Applicant married his first wife in January 2001. It is unclear whether Applicant was employed at that time. In March 2003, he began working as a risk and security administrator for a large bank. (GE 3.) In January 2007, Applicant execute",

The DCSA CAF took the \naction under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); \nand the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG) effective within the \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn April 27, 2020, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \ndecision on the written record in lieu of a hearing before a Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) administrative judge. On May 20, 2020, the Government submitted a File \nof Relevant Material (FORM), including eight items consisting of its documentary evidence. \nOn May 29, 2020, DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant, and instructed him \nthat any response was due within 30 days of receipt. Applicant received the FORM on \nJune 11, 2020. He submitted an undated response, which was received by DOHA on July \n10, 2020. He objected to Item 4 of the FORM, but did not otherwise comment about the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence. On July 16, 2020, Department Counsel indicated that the \nGovernment had no objection to consideration of Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM. \nOn July 30, 2020, the case was assigned to me to determine whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance \nfor Applicant. I received the case file on August 5, 2020. \nEvidentiary Rulings \nDepartment Counsel submitted as Item 4 in the FORM a summary report of a \npersonal subject interview (PSI) of Applicant conducted on May 1, 2019. The summary \nreport was included in a DOD report of investigation (ROI) in Applicant\u2019s case. Under \u00b6 \nE3.1.20 of the Directive, a DOD personal background ROI may be received in evidence \nand considered with an authenticating witness, provided it is otherwise admissible under \nthe Federal Rules of Evidence. The summary report did not bear the authentication \nrequired for admissibility under \u00b6 E3.1.20. \nIn ISCR Case No. 16-03126 decided on January 24, 2018, the DOHA Appeal Board \nheld that it was not error for an administrative judge to admit and consider a summary of a \nPSI where the applicant was placed on notice of his or her opportunity to object to \nconsideration of the summary; the applicant filed no objection to it; and there is no \nindication that the summary contained inaccurate information. In this case, Applicant was \nprovided a copy of the FORM and advised of his opportunity to submit objections or \nmaterial that he wanted the administrative judge to consider. In the FORM, Applicant\u2019s \nattention was directed to the following important notice: \nNOTICE TO APPLICANT: The Report of PSI contains a summary of \ninformation you provided during your interview with an authorized \ninvestigator for the Office of Personnel Management, as recorded by \nthe investigator. The Report is being provided to the Administrative \nJudge for consideration as part of the record evidence in this case. In \nyour response to this FORM, you may comment on whether the Report \naccurately reflects the information you provided to the investigator, and \nyou may make any corrections, additions, deletions, and updates \nnecessary to make the Report clear and accurate. Alternatively, you \nmay object to the use of this Report as evidence on the grounds [sic] \nthat it is unauthenticated by a Government witness, and it may not be \nconsidered as evidence. If you do not object to the Report or if you do \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnot respond to this FORM, the Administrative Judge may determine that \nyou have waived any objection to the Report\u2019s admissibility and \nconsider it as evidence in your case. \nIn his response to the FORM, Applicant objected to consideration of the summary \nreport of the PSI \u201con the grounds that it is of doubtful authenticity by a Government \nwitness, and it may not be qualified as evidence.\u201d The Government did not request a \nhearing under \u00b6 E3.1.7 at which it could have presented the testimony of the investigator, \nand did not object to Applicant\u2019s FORM response. Accordingly, the unauthenticated PSI \n(Item 4) is not accepted in evidence and will not be considered. Items 1-3 and 5-8 are \nentered into the record. Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM is accepted in evidence as \nApplicant exhibit (AE) A. \nFindings of Fact \n \nThe SOR (Item 1) alleges under Guideline F that, as of April 2, 2020, Applicant \nowed a $179,4500 deficiency balance on a foreclosed mortgage loan (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and five \nmedical collection debts of $951 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), $401 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), $103 (SOR \u00b6 1.d), $77 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.e), and $61 (SOR \u00b6 1.f). \n \n \nWhen he responded to the SOR, Applicant denied the alleged debts. He indicated \nthat the balances were erroneous, and that the debts had been \u201ccleared by the credit \nbureau\u201d and no longer appeared on his credit reports. He provided no substantiating \ndocumentation but asked the DOD to retrieve his credit report for confirmation. (Item 2.) \n \n \nAfter considering the FORM (excluding the PSI but including Applicant\u2019s Answer to \nthe SOR), and Applicant\u2019s rebuttal to the FORM (AE A), I make the following findings of \nfact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 45-year-old immigrant from Haiti who finished high school in the \nUnited States in 1992. He is twice married and divorced and has no children. Applicant \nearned a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2006 while working as a risk and security administrator \nin the information technology sector. He began working for a defense contractor in March \n2019 and seeks a security clearance for his duties as a senior cyber-security engineer. \n(Item 3.) \n \n \nApplicant married his first wife in January 2001. It is unclear whether Applicant was \nemployed at that time. In March 2003, he began working as a risk and security \nadministrator for a large bank. (GE 3.) In January 2007, Applicant executed a promissory \nnote, and he and his first wife obtained a $123,971 30-year mortgage loan securing \npayment of the note. Monthly mortgage payments for their home were initially $753 per \nmonth based on an interest rate of 6.125%. (Item 7.) \n \n  \nApplicant and his first wife\u2019s relationship ended in approximately January 2008. \nApplicant retained possession of the marital residence following their divorce. (Item 3.) In \nFebruary 2009, Applicant obtained a modification of the promissory n\n ote and mortgage. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nUnder the new terms, he agreed to repay a principal loan balance of $129,844, initially at \n$552 per month, with the loan to mature on March 1, 2049. The interest rate on the loan \nwas 4.125%. (Item 7.) \nApplicant was married to his second wife from January 31, 2010 to December 1, \n2012. From October 2011 to July 2012, Applicant was employed as an information security \nadministrator in the maritime industry. During that time, he traveled to Haiti for less than a \nweek in March 2012 to visit family or friends. (Item 3.) It is unclear whether his second wife, \nalso a native of Haiti, accompanied him. \nApplicant lost his job with the maritime company in July 2012 due to a corporate \nmerger, but he started a new job as an information technology security analyst with an \ninvestment company in August 2012. Based on available address information for Applicant, \nhe moved out of his home upon his divorce from his second wife in December 2012. (Item \n3.) He continued to own the home, however, and, in December 2013, he obtained another \nmodification of the mortgage on the marital home shared with his first wife. Under the new \nterms, he agreed to pay a principal loan balance of $154,857, initially at $647 per month. \nThe loan\u2019s new maturity date was November 1, 2053, and its interest rate was 4.00%. \n(Item 7.) Applicant did not explain his rationale for increasing his mortgage obligation by \napproximately $25,000. \nIn November 2014, Applicant traveled to Haiti for less than a week to visit family and \nfriends. In February 2015, Applicant was laid off from his job with the investment company. \nUnemployed until October 2015, he went to Haiti for three or four weeks in March 2015 and \nfor less than one week in September 2015 to visit family and friends. He also took two \nseparate trips to Jamaica for volunteer activities for six to ten days in June 2015 and in \nOctober 2015. (Item 3.) \nApplicant made no mortgage payments after May 2015. In late October 2015, his \nmortgage lender moved to foreclose on the property for nonpayment of the loan with a \nprincipal balance of $151,644. In April 2017, the company servicing his loan obtained a \nfinal judgment of foreclosure. With interest, expenses, costs, and fees, the balance of his \nloan debt was $177,621. (Item 7.) A judgment lien was filed against Applicant and his first \nwife in the amount of $151,644, the principal due on the note secured by the foreclosed \nmortgage. (Item 8.) On August 28, 2017, the loan servicer acquired the property for \n$80,600. (Item 7.) \nFrom October 2015 to May 2018, Applicant worked as a contractor for a succession \nof three companies. He traveled to Haiti for little over a week in August 2016 for volunteer \nactivities, and in December 2012, he went to Europe as a tourist. After his employment \ncontract ended in May 2018, Applicant was unemployed until March 2019. He traveled to \nCuba for tourism purposes in November 2018. (Item 3.) \nIn March 2019, Applicant began working for his defense-contractor employer. On \nMarch 29, 2019, he completed and certified to the accuracy of a Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (SF 86). Applicant responded negatively to the SF 86\u2019s financial \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrecord inquiries concerning any delinquency involving enforcement, including whether he \nhad a lien placed against his property for failing to pay taxes or other debts in the last \nseven years. He responded affirmatively to the financial record inquiries regarding any \ndelinquency involving routine accounts in the last seven years and listed a $49,267 \nmortgage delinquency on his marital home with his first wife and one medical debt that was \nplaced for collection for $501. He indicated that the mortgage had been resolved in \nDecember 2017 and that he was currently making payments on the medical debt. He gave \nthe following explanation for the mortgage delinquency: \nMy financial mortgage circumstances started after the divorce of my wife. \nPrior to our divorce we were both working and contributing to the mortgage \nand household expenses. However, after our divorce the mortgage was still \nunder my name and I struggled to pay the mortgage. Therefore, I made \nseveral attempts to sell the home, however, my ex-wife was not willing to \ncollaborate in the process of selling the home. The situation got worse after \nlosing my job and I ended [up] losing the home in foreclosure. Fortunately, \nthe home has been sold at fair market value and the remaining debt of \n$49,267.36 has been discharged by the bank resulting in zero debt. (Item 3.) \nRegarding efforts to address that debt, Applicant stated: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI applied for mortgage modification which helped reduced [sic] the mortgage, \nhowever that was not enough to sustain my financial situation at the time. I \nspend [sic] a few days negotiating with the mortgage company on a \nresolution to stop the foreclosure process. However I did not have the total \namount required by the bank to reverse the foreclosure. (Item 3.) \n \nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on April 12, 2019, showed Applicant\u2019s mortgage loan \nas $32,081 past due on a balance of $179,450 as of October 2017. Applicant had five \nmedical collection debts on his record: $951 from April 2019; $401 from June 2014 in \ncollection since September 2018; $103 from October 2012 in collection since May 2013; \n$77 from May 2014 in collection since December 2014; and $61 from May 2014 in \ncollection since December 2014. Applicant was reportedly making timely payments on a \ncredit card with a disputed balance of $2,710; on a secured loan obtained in September \n2017 for $16,483 with a balance of $12,168; and on a credit card with a $610 balance. \nApplicant owed $26,819 on six deferred student loans that had been delinquent in 2017. \n(Item 6.) \nAs of November 16, 2019, Equifax was reporting Applicant\u2019s foreclosed mortgage \nloan as $32,081 past due on a $179,450 balance as of October 2017. His monthly \nmortgage payment obligation was reportedly $895. Applicant was continuing to make \ntimely payments of $429 per month on a secured loan (balance $10,902) and on two credit \ncards with balances of $2,491 and $49. The balance on his student loans had risen to \n$28,478, and his student loans were last delinquent in 2017. The medical collection debts \nhad been deleted from his credit record. (Item 5.) \n5 \n\n \n \n \nThe DCSA CAF issued an SOR to Applicant on April 2, 2020, because of the \ndelinquent mortgage, alleging a deficiency balance of $179,450 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and five \nmedical collection debts totaling $1,593 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.f). (Item 1.) In response, Applicant \nstated on April 27, 2020, that the reported debt balances were erroneous, and that all of \nthe debts had been \u201ccleared by the credit bureau and [are] no longer showing in [his] credit \nreport accounts.\u201d (Item 2.) He did not provide with his SOR response any substantiating \ndocumentation to show that the debts have been resolved or that his liability for repayment \nwas cancelled in whole or in part. \n \n \nIn response to the FORM, Applicant provided an incomplete copy of his credit report \nobtained from Experian on July 3, 2020. It showed a zero balance on his mortgage loan as \nof August 1, 2017, with the following payment status: \u201cCredit grantor reclaimed collateral to \nsettle defaulted mortgage.\u201d No collection accounts were listed under the collections \nsection. Applicant did not provide the section of his credit report listing his open accounts. \nThe account summary shows that he has two open credit-card accounts with balances \ntotaling $3,354 (credit limits $4,150) and seven installment loans (likely his six student \nloans and the September 2017 secured loan) with balances totaling $34,911. Eight of his \naccounts had been late at some time. (AE A.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nApplicant presented no details about his income or expenses. There is no evidence \nthat he has had any financial or budget counseling. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \nAn applicant is not required to be debt free, but is required to manage his finances \nin a way as to exhibit sound judgment and responsibility. The Appeal Board explained the \nscope and rationale for the financial considerations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-\n05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) as follows: \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances.

Applicant admits that he defaulted on the \nmortgage loan that he obtained for $123,971 in January 2007, which he had modified for \n$129,844 in February 2009 and for $154,857 in December 2013. In April 2017, the loan \nwas foreclosed and a $151,644 lien (then the principal balance on the mortgage) was filed \nagainst him. Applicant does not deny that he defaulted on the mortgage loan, but he \ndisputes the alleged outstanding balance of $179,450. Available records regarding the \nforeclosure and sale of the property indicate that the deficiency balance may well have \nbeen closer to the $49,267 listed on his SF 86, given the loan servicer acquired the \nproperty for $80,600 in August 2017, and the loan had a principal balance of $151,644 in \nApril 2017. Applicant\u2019s recent credit report shows a zero balance on the loan and the \ncomment that the creditor reclaimed the collateral to settle the defaulted mortgage, which \ntends to substantiate his claim that his obligation to pay the deficiency balance has been \ndischarged by the bank. While that debt may no longer be a source of undue financial \npressure for Applicant, the federal government is still entitled to consider the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding an applicant\u2019s conduct in incurring and failing to satisfy the debt \nin a timely manner. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-03991 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 1, 2015.). The \nAppeal Board has held that the administrative judge is not precluded from considering \nwhether the circumstances underlying a debt impugn an applicant\u2019s judgment or reliability. \nSee, e.g., ADP Case No. 14-02206 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 15, 2015). His mortgage default \nestablishes disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nThe five medical collection debts alleged in the SOR totaling $1,654 are all on his \nApril 2019 credit report. Applicant asserts without explanation that the medical collection \ndebts were all erroneous. It is unclear whether he denies the debts on grounds of no legal \nliability, payment, or other reason, such as an accounting mistake. Under \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment bears the burden of establishing controverted issues of fact. The Appeal \nBoard has held that adverse information from a credit report can normally meet the \nsubstantial evidence standard. See ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, \n2015) (citing, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). The April 2019 \ncredit report (Item 6) is sufficient to establish the medical collection debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-\n1.f. Furthermore, Applicant listed one medical collection debt on his March 2019 SF 86. \nBased on the creditor and account number, it appears to be the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c) also apply because of the five medical collection debts. \nThe burden is on Applicant to mitigate the negative implications for his financial \njudgment raised by his delinquent debts. Application of the aforesaid disqualifying \nconditions triggers consideration of the potentially mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20. \nOne or more of the following conditions may apply in whole or in part: \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant stopped paying on his modified mortgage loan in mid-2015, and his \nsmaller medical collection debts were incurred more than five years ago. The record does \nnot show when the $951 medical collection debt was incurred or assigned for collection. \nEven so, there is no evidence that the medical debts have been paid or were listed on his \ncredit report erroneously. Those debts are considered recent because an applicant\u2019s \nongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct. See, e.g., ISCR 17-03146 \nat 2 (App. Bd. July 31, 2018) (citing e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08779 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, \n2017)). AG \u00b6 20(a) is not sufficiently established. \nRegarding AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant explained on his SF 86 that his mortgage \ndifficulties started because of the loss of his first wife\u2019s income after their divorce. He \nstruggled to make his loan payments on his income alone, and while loan modifications \nprovided some relief for a time, he could no longer afford to make the mortgage payments \nafter he lost his job. He gave a date of January 2008 for his first divorce. Loan records \nshow that he obtained his first loan modification in February 2009, while he was gainfully \nemployed as a risk and security administrator in the financial sector, but he was \nunemployed for a year after he was laid off in September 2010. Applicant obtained a \nsecond modification in December 2013, while he was employed full time. He defaulted on \nthat mortgage while unemployed after a February 2015 layoff. Applicant\u2019s divorce and \nunexpected job losses are circumstances outside his control that implicate AG \u00b6 20(b) with \nrespect to his mortgage default. AG \u00b6 20(b) also has some applicability with respect to his \nmedical debts, including SOR \u00b6 1.b owed to a hospital, in that such debts are not \nconsidered discretionary. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFor AG \u00b6 20(b) to fully apply in mitigation, Applicant has to demonstrate that he \nacted responsibly under his circumstances to address his debts. His evidence in that \nregard falls somewhat short. Applicant indicated on his SF 86 that he tried several times to \nsell the home, but his ex-wife, who was on the mortgage but not the promissory note, \nwould not cooperate. He did not elaborate about what efforts he made to sell the house or \nwhen he tried to sell the home. As for the mortgage modifications, which he indicated \nhelped reduce his mortgage payment, available information shows that he took on about \n$25,000 in additional mortgage debt with the December 2013 modification. Any unpaid late \ncharges were waived through that modification, and he lowed the interest rate on his loan \nfrom 4.125% to 4.00%, although it was not shown that his monthly mortgage payment \nobligation was lowered. Applicant did not explain why he took out a substantial amount of \nthe property\u2019s equity. During his unemployment from February 2015 to October 2015, \nApplicant took three separate trips to the Caribbean while the mortgage loan went unpaid. \nRecords show that the bank holding the mortgage filed a complaint to foreclose on his loan \nin late October 2015. As the foreclosure process was proceeding, and the delinquency on \nhis loan continued to mount, Applicant returned to traveled to Haiti in August 2016 to visit \nfamily and friends. Applicant indicates that he could not afford the payment required by the \nbank to avert foreclosure, but he provided no evidence of his income or expenses that \ncould possibly mitigate the negative inferences for his financial judgment caused by his \ndefault. Likewise, Applicant stated on his SF 86 that he was making payments on a \nmedical collection debt (SOR \u00b6 1.c), but he provided no proof that the debt or the other \nmedical collection debts have been repaid. \nNeither AG \u00b6 20(c) nor AG \u00b6 20(d) is satisfied by the creditor\u2019s reclamation of \nproperty to settle the defaulted mortgage. Applicant acknowledged owing a deficiency \nbalance on his loan of $49,267 after the foreclosure sale, which he made no effort to \nrepay. Even assuming that his liability for repayment of the deficiency has been discharged \nby the lender, not enough is known about his current financial situation to overcome the \nfinancial judgment concerns in this case. He presented no evidence of his current income \nor expenses, so a reasonable assessment of his financial situation is not possible. \nMoreover, he did not provide any proof that the medical collection debts have been \naddressed. The Appeal Board cogently explained why a credit report may not be sufficient \nto meet an applicant\u2019s burden, stating: \nAs we have previously stated, a credit report, in and of itself, may not be \nsufficient to meet an applicant\u2019s burden of persuasion as to mitigation, \ninsofar as it provides little evidence regarding the underlying circumstances \nof the debt. Moreover, the fact that a debt no longer appears on a credit \nreport does not establish a meaningful, independent evidence as to the \ndisposition of the debt. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. \nAug. 25, 2015). For example, debts may fall off credit reports merely due to \nthe passage of time. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 6 (App. Bd. Oct. \n26, 2006).  \nISCR Case No. 16-01338 at 3 (Jul. 13, 2018). Applicant has asserted with respect to each \nof the collection debts that they have been cleared by the credit bureau. He provided no \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nproof that the medical collection debts have been \u201ccleared\u201d either because they had been \npaid or because he disputed them, and they could not be verified. \nThe security clearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed at collecting an \napplicant\u2019s personal debts. It is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness with regard to his fitness or suitability to handle classified \ninformation appropriately. See ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. June 21, 2010). Less \nweight is afforded to Applicant\u2019s July 2020 credit report because it is incomplete. What can \nbe gleaned from the account summary is that eight of Applicant\u2019s accounts have been late \nand that he has nine open accounts. He owes $3,354 on two credit cards with credit limits \ntotaling $4,150. While he is under his credit limits, his overall credit usage is 81%. His \nstudent loans were delinquent in 2017 before being deferred. The current status of his \nstudent loans is unclear. A reasonably accurate assessment of Applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation cannot be made without knowing his present income and expenses. It cannot yet \nbe determined that Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties are behind him or unlikely to reoccur. \nThe financial considerations security concerns are not fully mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security clearance eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe [pertinent] guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F \nare incorporated in my whole-person analysis. \nIt was incumbent on Applicant to show that his financial situation is sufficiently stable \nand not likely to present an ongoing security concern. As discussed above, too many \nunanswered questions exist about his financial situation. Moreover, because Applicant \nchose to have his security clearance eligibility evaluated without a hearing, I was unable to \nassess his sincerity and demeanor. He presented no employment or character references \nattesting to his judgment and reliability in handling his personal and work affairs. The \nAppeal Board has repeatedly held that the government need not wait until an applicant \nmishandles or fails to safeguard classified information before denying or revoking security \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclearance eligibility. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-09918 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009, citing \nAdams v. Laird, 420 F 2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969)). It is well settled that once a \nconcern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong \npresumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, \n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). After applying the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions to the evidence presented, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for Applicant. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant.

Applicant received the FORM on \nAugust 24, 2020, and had 30 days from its receipt to file objections and submit additional \ninformation. Applicant did not submit any additional documents or file objections to the \nGovernment\u2019s evidence. Items 1 through 6 are admitted into evidence. I received the case \nfile from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on October 20, 2020. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all six allegations contained in the SOR with explanations. (Item \n1) \nApplicant is 31 years old and has been married to his wife since 2017. They have \none child. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2015. He began working for a defense \ncontractor in July 2018. Prior to this position, he worked in the private sector. (Item 2) \nIn February 2019, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). (Item 2) After filing his e-QIP, Applicant was \ninterviewed in March 2019 by a government investigator. During that background \ninterview, Applicant was confronted about financial delinquencies listed on his February \n2019 credit bureau report (CBR), including two credit card accounts and four student \nloans. He addressed all of the investigator\u2019s inquiries. He said he paid and closed the two \ncredit card accounts, which he used in 2016 for a vacation in Mexico.

He denied that his debts were the consequence of living beyond his financial \nmeans. He stated that he was working on resolving all financial problems. (Item 1) \nBased on Applicant\u2019s admissions and credit bureau reports (CBR) from February \n2019, December 2019, and July 2020, the SOR alleged: two charged-off credit card debts \nand four delinquent student loans. The debts became delinquent between 2016 and 2019 \nand totaled over $62,000. (Items 4, 5, and 6) \nIn April 2020, Applicant paid the credit card debts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e for $4,343, \nand SOR \u00b6 1.f for $2,885. (Items 1, 4, and 6) In February 2020, he entered into a \nrehabilitation payment agreement with the Department of Education (DoE) to repay his \nstudent loans that totaled $35,624 at that time, and included the those alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d. According to the payment plan, he agreed to rehabilitate his loans \nby making nine monthly payments of $149.00, and thereafter to repay the loans in \naccordance with a revised payment agreement. In his Answer, Applicant stated that after \nhe made those payments for nine months, the loans would be out of default status by \nSeptember 2020.

(Item 6). After receiving the FORM in August 2020, he did not submit \nevidence documenting that he made additional payments on the loans. \nApplicant did not submit a written budget, listing his monthly income and expenses \nor financial status. He did not present evidence that he has participated in credit or \nbudgetary counseling. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility to hold a sensitive position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a position of trust. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. According to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he applicant \nis responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable [trustworthiness] decision.\u201d \nA person applying for a position of trust seeks to enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship transcends \nnormal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government reposes a \nhigh degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national security \neligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive information. Such \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations \nare set out in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise trustworthiness concerns. Two may \nbe disqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant admitted that he had delinquent debt, most of which he has been unable \nto resolve since 2016. The evidence raises the above trustworthiness concerns, thereby \nshifting the burden to Applicant to rebut, extenuate, or mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could potentially mitigate \ntrustworthiness concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s admitted financial problems: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s student loans have been outstanding and unresolved since 2016 and \ncontinue to cast doubt on his reliability. He paid two delinquent credit card debts. AG \u00b6 \n20 (a) does not apply to his delinquent student loans. \nApplicant attributed his current delinquent debts to a period of unemployment and \nhis wife\u2019s medical problems between 2018 and 2019. Those were circumstances beyond \nhis control. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. He did not provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that he \nattempted to responsibly manage his debts as they were accumulating. AG \u00b6 20(b) \napplies partially. \nApplicant did not provide evidence that he has participated in credit or financial \ncounseling. He has not established a budget to show responsible financial management \nof his delinquent student loans and other financial commitments. The evidence is \ninsufficient to conclude that there are clear indications that Applicant\u2019s delinquent student \nloans are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. \nApplicant presented evidence that he resolved two credit card debts. Although \nthose two debts are now paid, the payments were made after he received the SOR in \nApril 2020, and thus are less persuasive as good-faith efforts to resolve his debts. AG \u00b6 \n20(d) applies minimally to those credit card debts. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n               \n \n \n \n    \n \n              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n                                             \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant did \nnot pay his charged-off credit cards until after receiving the SOR. Applicant started to \naddress his student loans through a payment agreement two months before receiving the \nSOR, but he failed to comply with the terms of that agreement. Based on that evidence, \nand the lack of an established track record of responsible financial management, \nApplicant failed to meet his burden to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns raised under \nthe guideline for financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nSubparagraphs: 1.a through 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs: 1.e and 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition. National security eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline B that Applicant\u2019s mother is a citizen and resident of Taiwan. Applicant denies this allegation stating that his mother passed away in January 2020. The SOR also alleges that Applicant\u2019s two brothers are citizens and residents of Taiwan and that one brother works in the telecom field and the other works in the engineering field. The SOR further alleges that Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law is a citizen and resident of Taiwan, Applicant\u2019s wife is a dual citizen of Taiwan and the United States, and Applicant owns a home in Taiwan worth approximately $100,000. Applicant admits each of these allegations. However, he denies that any of these circumstances should raise security concerns. Applicant, 54, is a software engineer currently employed by a defense contractor since December 2017. He was born in Taiwan and attended high school, college, and graduate school in Taiwan. After receiving his master\u2019s degree in 1991, he was required to serve two years in the military. Applicant was a junior lieutenant in the Taiwanese Army from July 1991 until May 1993. In approximately 1994, Applicant moved to the United 2 States where he attended a university from 1994 until 1997, and received a second master\u2019s degree.

Applicant failed to mitigate \nthe potential security concerns raised by his ties to family members and his property \ninterest in Taiwan. Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on December 22, \n2017. On April 13, 2020, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent him a Statement of \nReasons (SOR), alleging security concerns under Guideline B. The DOD acted under \nExecutive Order (Ex.

The DOHA transmittal letter informed Applicant that he \nhad 30 days after receiving it to submit information. DOHA received his response on \nSeptember 1, 2020. The DOHA transmittal letter and receipt are appended to the record \nas Administrative Exhibit (Admin. Ex.) 1. The case was assigned to me on September 29, \n2020.  \nProcedural Issues \nIn the FORM, Department Counsel submitted memoranda requesting that I take \nadministrative notice of facts concerning Taiwan and China (P.R.C). (GX 4; GX 5.) In his \nresponse, Applicant objected to the request for administrative notice of facts concerning \nChina. In support of this objection, Applicant stated that his family has \u201clived exclusively \nin Taiwan for many generations, neither he nor his family have any ties to the PRC, and \nthat Taiwan is an independent democratic state and a strong ally of the United States. I \ndenied Applicant\u2019s objection. I have taken administrative notice of the relevant facts \ndiscussed below and given the appropriate weight to those facts. \nUnder Guideline B, one of the relevant factors in assessing whether an Applicant\u2019s \nforeign family members are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement is the \nhuman rights record of the specific foreign nation. Therefore, I sua sponte took \nadministrative notice of relevant facts, as set forth below, regarding Taiwan\u2019s human \nrights record as delineated in the U.S. Department of State\u2019s 2019 report on Taiwan\u2019s \nhuman rights practices. (U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, H.R. and Lab., \nTaiwan (March 11, 2020); https://www.state.gov/reports/2019-country-reports-on-\nhuman-rights-practices/taiwan/). \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline B that Applicant\u2019s mother is a citizen and \nresident of Taiwan. Applicant denies this allegation stating that his mother passed away \nin January 2020. The SOR also alleges that Applicant\u2019s two brothers are citizens and \nresidents of Taiwan and that one brother works in the telecom field and the other works \nin the engineering field.

This is Applicant\u2019s first application for a security clearance. (GX 2.) \nIn his answer, Applicant stated that one of his brothers is a general manager for a \ntelecom company and his other brother is a civil engineer employed by a private company \nthat \u201cthe nature of [their] work makes it unlikely that [Applicant] would be placed in a \nposition where [Applicant] must choose between foreign and U.S. interests due to \n[Applicant\u2019s] relationship with [them].\u201d He further stated that he is not in \u201cfrequent regular \ncommunication\u201d with either of his brothers and that he does not discuss his work with \nthem \u201cin a way that could lead to security concerns.\u201d \nApplicant stated that his mother-in-law is \u201cnot working or participating in any \npolitical or professional organization.\u201d He further stated that his relationship with his \nmother-in-law is unlikely to put him in a position of conflict between foreign and U.S. \ninterests. Since 2006, Applicant has traveled to Taiwan annually with the stated purposes \nof tourism and visiting family. He has visited with his family and his mother-in-law in \nperson on each of these visits. (GX 2; GX 3.) \nApplicant\u2019s wife is a dual citizen of Taiwan and the United States. She maintains \nher Taiwanese citizenship for ease of travel to visit her elderly mother. Applicant is also \na dual citizen of Taiwan and the United States. He stated on his e-QIP that Taiwan has \naffordable medical coverage for citizens and he maintains his Taiwanese citizenship in \ncase of a medical emergency. (GX 2.) \nApplicant was issued a Taiwanese passport in 2006 that expired in 2016. He \ntraveled to Taiwan using this passport annually from 2006 through 2015. In 2016, \nApplicant was issued a Taiwanese passport that expires in 2026. He used this passport \nto travel to Taiwan in 2016, 2017, and 2018. Applicant stated in his personal subject \ninterview (PSI) that he uses his Taiwanese passport to travel to Taiwan instead of his \nU.S. passport due to the restriction on the number of days he is permitted to stay in \ncountry when using his U.S. passport. (GX 3.) \nApplicant owns a home in Taiwan worth approximately $100,000. When listing the \nhome on his e-QIP, Applicant stated that the home was a \u201cgift from [his] parent.\u201d (GX 2.) \nIn his answer, he stated that he purchased the home in his name for his parents to live in \nduring their retirement. The home is currently uninhabited and after a \u201cculturally \nappropriate period\u201d of mourning of one year, he plans to sell the home. \nApplicant purchased a house in the United States in 2009. He stated in his answer \nthat his children were born U.S. citizens, he and his wife have lived solely in the United \nStates for more than 20 years, and they have been naturalized citizens for more than 15 \nyears. He further stated that he and his family consider themselves to be U.S. citizens \n\u201cfirst and foremost\u201d and that they have \u201cdemonstrated [their] allegiance\u201d to the United \nStates by exercising their rights as citizens by \u201cpaying taxes, voting, serving for jury duty, \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand supporting [their] local community.\u201d During his PSI, Applicant expressed his \nwillingness to relinquish his Taiwanese citizenship if required to do so by his employer.  \nThe United States and Taiwan enjoy a robust unofficial relationship. The 1979 U.S. \n- P.R.C. Joint Communique switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing. In the \nJoint Communique, the United States recognized the Government of the People\u2019s \nRepublic of China as the sole legal government of China, acknowledging the Chinese \nposition that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China. The Joint Communique \nalso stated that the people of the United States will maintain cultural, commercial, and \nother unofficial relations with the people of Taiwan. The United States does not support \nTaiwan independence. \nThe 2019 U.S. Department of State report on human rights in Taiwan noted that \nthere were no reports of significant human rights abuses. However, throughout 2019, \nBeijing adopted a more coercive policy toward Taiwan, seeking to isolate and intimidate \nTaipei into unification on Beijing\u2019s terms. In January 2019, General Secretary Xi delivered \na major speech wherein he claimed that Taiwan\u2019s unification with the P.R.C was \ninevitable and indicated that the \u201cone country, two systems\u201d model was the only \nacceptable arrangement for unification. That model has been consistently rejected by the \nTaiwanese public and presidential administrations, prompting Beijing to intensify its \nmultipronged campaign to coerce and isolate Taiwan. In implementing this policy, Beijing \nsharply escalated its military, diplomatic, and economic pressure against Taiwan, \nincluding interfering in Taiwan\u2019s media to shape public opinion on China and cross-Strait \nrelations. The deliberate crossing of the Taiwan Strait median line by Chinese fighter \naircraft in March 2019 was the first such crossing in 20 years and marked a sharp \nescalation in the military pressure Beijing has increasingly applied against Taipei. China \nsignaled that its intensifying campaign of military coercion had become official in a key \npolicy document released in July 2019. \nThe United States faces a serious threat to its national security from Chinese \nintelligence operations. China aggressively targets U.S. sensitive and protected \ninformation and Chinese actors are the world\u2019s most active perpetrators of economic \nespionage. Taiwan has also been an active collector of U.S. economic technologies that \nhave sensitive military applications. There have been multiple cases involving the illegal \nexport, or attempted illegal export, of U.S. restricted, dual-use, or military technology to \nTaiwan or by Taiwanese nationals. The dual-use of military technologies that have been \ntargeted include, but are not limited to, classified materials, trade secrets, weapons \ntechnologies, and high-tech microelectronics. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, \n1993 WL 545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe concern is set forth in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: AG \u00b6 7 \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; \nAG \u00b6 7(e): shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \nAG \u00b6 7(f): substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign owned or foreign operated business that could \nsubject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation \nor personal conflict of interest. \n6 \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(e), and 7(f) require evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened \nrisk\u201d required to raise these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low standard. \n\u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \nmember living under a foreign government or owning property in a foreign country. \nThe mere possession of ties with family in Taiwan is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying \nunder Guideline B. However, if an applicant has such a relationship, this factor alone is \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information.

The totality of \nApplicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well as each individual family tie must be \nconsidered. A[T]here is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, the immediate family members of the person's spouse.@ ISCR Case No. 01-\n03120, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 94 at * 8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002); see also ISCR Case No. \n09-06457 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 2011).  \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those \nof the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nFurthermore, \u201ceven friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United \nStates over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 00-0317, (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002). \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its \nhuman rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an Applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or \nthe country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the United States. \nAlthough Taiwan\u2019s human rights record is good, Taiwan\u2019s active efforts to collect U.S. \ntechnologies and the illegal export, or attempted illegal export, of such technologies \nplaces a high burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his relationships \nwith his family members in Taiwan do not pose a security risk.  \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(f): the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or \nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely two result in a conflict and \ncould not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual. \nApplicant\u2019s contacts with his family members and his mother-in-law include annual \nin-person visits in Taiwan. Such contact is frequent and not casual. While Applicant \nasserted that he does not discuss his work with his brothers in a way that could create \nsecurity concerns, this statement implies that Applicant does discuss his work with his \nbrothers to some degree. Applicant is employed by a U.S. defense contractor as a \nsoftware engineer. The mere knowledge of this position by persons in Taiwan or China \ncreate a heightened risk of vulnerability to exploitation or coercion. \nIt is unclear from the record whether Applicant purchased the home in Taiwan for \nhis parents to reside in during their retirement before or after becoming a U.S. citizen. It \nis also unclear from the record what the value of Applicant\u2019s assets in the United States \nare in light of the $100,000 value of his home in Taiwan. However, $100,000 is a \nsignificant amount of money. While Applicant explained why he is compelled to maintain \nthe home in Taiwan until after January 2021, the foreign property interest currently \nremains his. \nApplicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2006. He has established \nsubstantial ties with the United States, including purchasing a house, and has exercised \nhis rights as a citizen by voting, serving on jury duty, and paying his taxes as required. \nHe declared his willingness to renounce his Taiwanese citizenship if required to do so by \nhis employer. However, given the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to his family members in \nTaiwan and his property interest there, doubt remains as to whether Applicant can \nnecessarily be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. None of the \nmitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but I have also \nconsidered the following: \nAlthough his military service was mandatory, Applicant nonetheless served as an \nofficer in the Taiwanese Army for two years immediately prior to moving to the United \nStates. Applicant and his wife are dual citizens of the United States and Taiwan, and \ntravel to and from Taiwan using their Taiwanese passports. Applicant maintains his \nTaiwanese citizenship to take advantage of Taiwan\u2019s low-cost medical care in the event \nof a medical emergency. Applicant\u2019s wife maintains her Taiwanese citizenship to facilitate \ntravel to Taiwan to visit her elderly mother. While dual citizenship, possession of a foreign \npassport, foreign travel, and mandatory military service are not in and of themselves \ndisqualifying, the ongoing exercise of his rights as a Taiwanese citizen, combined with \nhis prior military service and his close family ties and property interest in Taiwan heighten \nthe potential for a conflict of interest for Applicant. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline B, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by his contacts with his family and his property \ninterest in Taiwan. Accordingly, I conclude he has not carried his burden of showing that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant his eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B (Foreign Influence): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b through 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \nStephanie C. Hess \nAdministrative Judge \n10 \n",

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201c[a]ny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability \nto protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible \nindicator of, other issues of personnel security concern such as \nexcessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance misuse, or \nalcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .   \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has significant past-due indebtedness. These facts establish prima \nfacie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and shift the burden to Applicant \nto mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes four conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant retired from the Navy and was underemployed. He acted responsibly \nunder unforeseen difficult circumstances that were completely beyond his control, and \nthere are clear indications that his financial issues are under control. He is making \nsignificant monthly payments towards his back child support, has settle his two debts \nwith Creditor B, and disputes the remaining two debts as they have been paid. The \nrecord establishes clear mitigation of financial security concerns under the provisions of \nAG \u00b6 20. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n    \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature adult, \nretired from the Navy, who took reasonable and effective action to resolve his financial \nissues. The likelihood that financial problems will recur is minimal. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me without doubt as to Applicant\u2019s judgment, eligibility, and suitability \nfor a security clearance. He fully met his burden to mitigate the security concerns arising \nunder the guideline for financial considerations. \n \n \n \n \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n Formal Findings \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nand a security clearance.

He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.d, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.k-1.u. He stated, \n\u201cI agree\u201d to the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.e, but his explanation amounted to a denial. He \nadmitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b but denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.c. \nHe denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 3.a. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing \nare incorporated in my findings of fact. \nGeneral Background Information \nApplicant is a 34-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He is the field service \nlead for a team providing IT support for the senior leadership on a military installation. (Tr. \n56-57.) He attended a community college from June 2010 to August 2012 and obtained \nan associate\u2019s degree in computer science. He married in August 2010. He and his wife \nlived apart for about three years while she was employed in another state. They are now \nliving together. They have no children. \nApplicant served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from September 2005 to January \n2008 and was honorably discharged for medical reasons. He testified that he was \ndischarged because he has angioedema, a swelling of areas under the skin. His medical \nrecords also reflect chronic lower back pain. He has a 30% disability and receives \ndisability pay of about $456 per month. (Tr. 80.) \nApplicant was employed by federal contractors in physical-security jobs from \nJanuary 2008 to March 2013. He was unemployed from March 2013 to February 2014. \nHe was employed by another federal contractor from February 2014 to September 2014, \nwhen he quit that job for a better opportunity. He was employed in the private sector from \n2 \n\n \nSeptember 2014 to August 2016. He worked for a federal contractor in August and \nSeptember 2016. (GX 1 at 10-16.) He was unemployed from September 2016 to January \n2017. (GX 2 at 7.) He has worked for his current employer since February 2017. His SCA \nreflects that he has never held a security clearance. (GX 1 at 32.) However, in his answer \nto the SOR, he refers to a reinvestigation of his clearance in 2017-2018, indicating that \nhe has previously held a clearance. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has 21 delinquent debts totaling about $61,348. \nThe evidence concerning these allegations is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: judgment obtained by a credit union in March 2015 for $24,582. \nApplicant obtained a debt-consolidation loan from his credit union, while he was on active \nduty. (GX 10 at 1; GX 12 at 10.) He made payments on this loan until he was laid off in \nMarch 2013. (Answer at 1.) In March 2015, the credit union obtained a judgment for \n$24,582. (GX 3.) In January 2020, the credit union initiated a garnishment of Applicant\u2019s \npay to satisfy the judgment. The interest, attorney\u2019s fees, and garnishment costs \nincreased the amount of the debt to $46,406, and a hearing on the garnishment was \nscheduled for May 2020. (AX A-2.) His pay has been garnished in the amount of $263.66 \nper week since January 2020. (AX 2.)  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: judgment obtained by a credit union in March 2015 for $13,029. In \nApplicant\u2019s answer to the SOR and at the hearing, he stated that this debt was included \nin SOR \u00b6 1.a. (Answer at 1; Tr. 92.) In March 2015, the credit union obtained a judgment \nfor $13,029. The judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a and this judgment were initiated on the \nsame day and the both judgments were entered on the same day, but they have different \ncase numbers, indicating two separate debts. (GX 3; GX 4.) This judgment is not satisfied. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: judgment obtained by an apartment complex in November 2018 \nfor $925. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant claimed that this judgment was for a \nfraudulent debt opened in his name. Court records reflect that a default judgment was \nentered against him. (GX 5.) At the hearing, he testified that he had never heard of the \ncreditor who obtained the judgment. He has taken no action to resolve it. (Tr. 96-97.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: judgment obtained by a furniture company in February 2018 for \n$992. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant claimed that this judgment was for a fraudulent \ndebt opened in his name. Court records reflect that a default judgment was entered \nagainst him. (GX 6.) He has taken no action to resolve it. (Tr. 97.) \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: judgment obtained by an apartment complex in October 2017 for \n$2,262. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant claimed that he had a payment agreement \nwith the rental company after being laid off, but new owners refused to honor the \nagreement and obtained a judgment in October 2017. Court records reflect that the \njudgment is not satisfied. (GX 7.) Applicant claimed that the amount owed was $1,100 \nand the rest of the amount of the judgment was for legal fees. (Answer at 1.)

(Tr. 99-100.) He provided no \ndocumentation of payments. The debt is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: unpaid court costs and fines of $356. In Applicant\u2019s answer to the \nSOR, he admitted this debt and said he was using his tax refunds to pay it. (Answer at \n1.) Court records reflect that the fines and costs were for failure to appear, resulting in his \nbeing charged with contempt of court. (GX 8.) At the hearing, he testified that he believed \nthat he paid them, but he submitted no documentation of payment. (Tr. 100.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: unpaid court costs and fines of $466. In Applicant\u2019s answer to the \nSOR, he admitted this debt and said he was using his tax refunds to pay it. (Answer at \n1.) The fines and costs were for an arrest for driving while intoxicated in April 2016 and a \nconviction in September 2016. (GX 9.) The arrest and conviction are alleged under \nGuideline G in SOR \u00b6 2.a and reflected in court records in GX 13. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g \nallege Applicant\u2019s failure to pay the fines and court costs for his September 2016 DWI \nconviction. He initially testified that he intended to pay them, but when he found that the \nfines and court costs were being taken from his tax refunds, he decided he would \u201clet \nthem take whatever they needed\u201d and then worry about those that were not paid. (Tr. 64.) \nLater in the hearing, he testified that he paid this debt in person at the courthouse, but he \nsubmitted no documentation of payment. (Tr. 100.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h charged-off automobile loan for $7,102. In Applicant\u2019s answer to the \nSOR, he denied this debt and claimed that it was a fraudulent debt opened in his name. \n(Answer at 1.) The credit reports reflect that the debt was for an automobile loan opened \nin January 2015. (GX 10 at 2; GX 11 at 2; GX 12 at 8.) In a personal subject interview \n(PSI) in August 2017, Applicant told the investigator that he bought a vehicle from a small \ndealership and financed it with a loan from the dealership. When he received a bill for a \nlarge sum of money from the dealership that he could not pay, he surrendered the vehicle. \n(GX 2 at 8-9.) At the hearing, he admitted that the debt is not resolved.

In Applicant\u2019s answer \nto the SOR, he admitted this debt and stated that he was making payments on it. (Answer \nat 1.) He submitted no documentation of payments. At the hearing, he testified that he \nattended college on the GI Bill and had no student loans. (Tr. 104.)

At \nthe hearing, he testified that he has made no effort to contract the creditor. (Tr. 105.) The \ndebt is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.m: cellphone account referred for collection of $730. In Applicant\u2019s \nanswer, he claimed that the debt was paid when he switched providers and the new \nprovider paid off the old account. The last activity on this account was in May 2013. It was \nreferred for collection in October 2017. (GX 10 at 2.) At the hearing, he testified that he \nreferred this debt to a credit-repair company in 2017 but received no response from the \ncredit-repair company or the creditor. (Tr. 107.) He terminated his contract with the credit-\nrepair company after one year because they made no progress. (Tr. 109.) The debt is not \nresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.n: credit-union debt charged off for $569. In Applicant\u2019s answer, he \nstated that this debt was included in a debt-consolidation loan. The creditor for this debt \nis the same credit union alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. It was charged off in September \n2014, before the judgments alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b were entered. (GX 10 at 2.) It \nis likely that this debt was included in one of the judgments. \nSOR \u00b6 1.o: utility bill placed for collection of $306.

It was placed for collection \nin October 2018. (GX 10 at 2.) At the hearing, Applicant testified that he still has an \naccount with this company, but he has not contacted the company to determine the basis \nfor this collection account. (Tr. 111.) He did not provide any evidence to show that his \naccount is current. \nSOR \u00b6 1.p: telecommunication bill placed for collection of $164.

At the hearing, he testified that he contacted the creditor \nand was informed that it has no record of this debt. He did not ask the creditor for \ndocumentation. (Tr. 112.) The debt is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.q: telecommunication bill placed for collection of $1,516. In \nApplicant\u2019s answer, he stated that this was a fraudulent debt. The service provider for this \ndebt is the same as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.p, but the account number is different. It was \nplaced for collection in July 2016. (GX 11 at 2.)

In Applicant\u2019s \nanswer to the SOR, he stated that this debt was for unreturned equipment and that the \nequipment was picked up by a representative of the service provider in his presence. (Tr. \n113.) It appears that Applicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing may have confused this debt \nwith the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.q. The date of last activity on this account was in May 2016. It \nwas placed for collection in August 2017. (GX 11 at 2.) At the hearing, he testified that he \nnever had an account with this creditor. (Tr. 114, 138.)

It is reflected in the September 2016 credit report as a deferred \nstudent loan opened in August 2012. (GX 12 at 8.) It is reflected in the January 2018 \ncredit report as more than 180 days past due. (GX 11 at 2.) It is reflected in the May 2019 \ncredit report as a collection account assigned to the government. (GX 10 at 2.) At the \nhearing, Applicant testified that he had not tried to determine the basis for the adverse \ncredit-report entries. (Tr. 115.) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.t and 1.u: telecommunication bills placed for collection of $942 and \n$366. In Applicant\u2019s answer, he stated that these are fraudulent debts. They are reflected \nin the September 2016 credit report. The first was for cellphone service and was placed \nfor collection in September 2014. The second appears to be for other telecommunications \nservices, and it was placed for collection in September 2016. (GX 12 at 8-9.) At the \nhearing, Applicant testified that he contacted the creditor. (Tr. 114-15.) He submitted no \ndocumentation showing that he had contacted the creditor or that the debts were being \nresolved. \n \nApplicant\u2019s disability pay is $456 per month.

He pays $800 per month to his wife for \u201crent,\u201d $89 per month for Internet service, \n$300 every two weeks for groceries, $100 per month for video games, and $80 per month \nfor cigarettes. He does not have a savings account. He has about $2,000 in his checking \naccount. He intends to start a 401(k) retirement account. (Tr. 126-28.) He testified that he \ndoes not know his wife\u2019s annual salary, but it is more than he earns. (Tr. 90.) His wife \ntestified that they shared finances briefly after they were married, but she now takes care \nof most of their living expenses. She was not asked and did not disclose her annual salary. \nAt the time of her testimony, she was not aware of Applicant\u2019s financial problems that are \nalleged in the SOR.

He began drinking regularly in 2013, after he lost his job. \nBefore 2013, he drank socially but infrequently. (Tr. 60.). \nApplicant was charged with DWI on February 2005. In his answer to the SOR, he \ndenied being charged or convicted. He stated that he was sitting in his mother\u2019s parked \ncar and talking on the phone when the police searched the car and found his mother\u2019s \nprescription drugs in the glove box and charged him with possession of a controlled \nsubstance. He claimed that the charges were \u201cthrown out\u201d because there was no \nevidence that he was intoxicated or was driving. However, the court records reflect that \nhis mother posted a $500 bond, he was arraigned in March 2005, and he pleaded guilty \nto DWI. (GX 15.) This conviction is alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.c. \nApplicant was charged with DWI in April 2016 and convicted in September 2016. \nThis conviction is alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a. He testified that had been working late at night, \naround 10:00 p.m., and he stopped at a parking lot to have a telephone conversation with \nhis wife that became tense. He testified that after the conversation ended, he went to a \nnearby bar and had two or three drinks. (Tr. 117-19.) He was stopped as he was driving \nhome at about 1:00 a.m. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 30 days in jail, \nsuspended, fined $250, assessed court costs of $216, and placed on unsupervised \nprobation for two years. His driver\u2019s license was restricted and he was required to install \nan ignition interlock. (GX 13.) \nApplicant was again charged with DWI in September 2016 and convicted in \nFebruary 2017. His blood-alcohol content (BAC) was more than .15. He pleaded guilty \nand was sentenced to 365 days in jail, with 305 days suspended, a fine of $1,000, court \ncosts of $236, and unsupervised probation for 36 months. (GX 14.) This conviction is \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 2.b. \nAfter Applicant\u2019s arrest for DWI in April 2016, he was required by the court to \ncomplete a 12-week substance abuse program. (Tr. 66.) After his DWI arrest in \nSeptember 2016, he was jailed, and the court informed him that he would not be released \non bond unless he was enrolled in a substance-abuse program. \nOn October 24, 2016, Applicant was admitted into a residential substance-abuse \nprogram administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). On admission, he was \ndiagnosed with an alcohol-abuse disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, and chronic low \nback pain. (AX C at 272.) During his intake, he disclosed that for the past year he had \nbeen drinking between a pint and a fifth of rum or brandy daily. (AC C at 61.) His diagnosis \nwas later changed to alcohol dependence. (AX C at 1.) He was required to live at the VA \nfacility and could not leave without a pass. He received individual and group counseling, \nwas tested regularly for alcohol use, and was required to attend Alcoholics Anonymous \n(AA) meetings. He was allowed to leave the facility to seek employment. The facility \nrecords reflect that he was cooperative, attentive, and compliant.

(Tr. 66-67.) On August 31, 2020, he notified \nhis attorney that he had self-admitted into a medical facility and would be there for an \nundetermined period. His attorney requested that the hearing scheduled for September \n3, 2020, be postponed. Applicant submitted no documentation of the dates of this period \nof rehabilitation, but his testimony is corroborated by his attorney\u2019s correspondence about \npostponing the hearing and his attorney\u2019s multiple updates about his projected completion \ndates for the rehabilitation program. The correspondence about the postponement and \nrescheduling of the hearing is attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit I. \nApplicant submitted no evidence about the content of this recent rehabilitation \nprogram. He submitted no evidence of a diagnosis or prognosis by a medical professional \nassociated with the program. He testified that he has abstained from alcohol and attended \nAA meetings every other day since his completion of the rehabilitation program in October \n2020. (Tr. 70.) He provided no documentation of his AA participation. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \nand \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicants delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established.

ISCR Case No. 09-05700 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, 2011), citing ISCR Case No. 08-\n06058 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2009). He submitted no evidence of payments or payment \nagreements for any of the debts alleged in the SOR, except for the debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.q and 1.r. He submitted evidence that he had contacted these two creditors on \nFebruary 1, 2021, after the hearing, about possible payment agreements, and he had \nmade one payment on the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.r. However, an applicant who waits \nuntil his clearance is in jeopardy before resolving debts may be lacking in the judgment \nexpected of those with access to classified information.

The \ninconsistencies between Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR and his testimony at the hearing \nreflect that he does not have a good grasp of his financial situation and does not have a \nrealistic plan to resolve his delinquent debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant denied several debts in his answer to the \nSOR and claimed that they were fraudulent, but he provided no documentary evidence \nof fraud, no evidence that he disputed the debts with the collection agencies, original \ncreditors, or the credit bureaus, and no evidence that any disputed debts were resolved \nin his favor. \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \u201cExcessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control \nimpulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d \nThe SOR alleges three incidents involving driving while intoxicated. Applicant\u2019s \nrelapse in August 2020 and his subsequent treatment are not alleged in the SOR and \nmay not be an independent basis for denying a clearance. However, conduct not alleged \nin the SOR may be considered to assess an applicant=s credibility; to decide whether a \nparticular adjudicative guideline is applicable; to evaluate evidence of extenuation, \nmitigation, or changed circumstances; to consider whether an applicant has \ndemonstrated successful rehabilitation; or as part of a whole-person analysis.

Oct. 26, 2006). I have considered Applicant\u2019s recent relapse \nand treatment for these limited purposes. \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, \nor other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \nAG \u00b6 22(d): diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health \nprofessional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed \nclinical social worker) of alcohol use disorder; \nAG \u00b6 22(e): the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \nAG \u00b6 22(f): alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nor does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive \nalcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \nAG \u00b6 23(d): the individual has successfully completed a treatment program \nalong with any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and \nestablished pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance \nwith treatment recommendations. \n12 \n \nAG \u00b6 23(a) is established for the DWI charge in 2005, alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.c. It \noccurred 15 years ago, before he enlisted in the Navy. Ten years elapsed before the next \nalcohol-related incident. This incident is mitigated by the passage of time. \n\n \n \nAG \u00b6 23(a) is not established for the DWI charges alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b. \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related conduct during 2016 was frequent and did not occur under \ncircumstances making recurrence unlikely. Although the DWI was almost four years ago, \nit was \u201crecent.\u201d There are no Abright line@ rules for determining when conduct is Arecent.@ \nThe determination must be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence. \nIf the evidence shows Aa significant period of time has passed without any evidence of \nmisconduct,@ then an administrative judge must determine whether that period of time \ndemonstrates Achanged circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform \nor rehabilitation.@ ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). The time \nbetween Applicant\u2019s conviction of DWI in February 2017 and his relapse in August 2020 \nis a \u201csignificant period of time,\u201d However, Applicant was on probation until February 2020, \nand he resumed his alcohol consumption shortly after his probation ended, probably in \nJuly or August 2020. I conclude that the DWI arrest in September 2016 is \u201crecent\u201d within \nthe meaning of this mitigating condition. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b) and 23(d) are not fully established. Applicant has acknowledged his \nmaladaptive alcohol use and he has taken actions to overcome his problem. He has \ncompleted two treatment programs. However, insufficient time has passed to \ndemonstrate a clear and established pattern of abstinence. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe SOR cross-alleges Applicant\u2019s alcohol related conduct under this guideline. \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates doubt \nabout a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into \nquestion a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d \nThe evidence establishes the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6 32(a) is established for the incident alleged in SOR 2.c, which is mitigated by \nthe passage of time. Neither mitigating condition is established for the incidents alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b, for the reasons set out in the above discussion of Guideline G. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F, G, and J in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered \nApplicant\u2019s military service and service-connected disabilities. I have considered that he \nvoluntarily undertook his most recent treatment for alcohol dependence. He appeared \nsincere at the hearing. However, his lack of financial responsibility and the recency of his \nalcoholic relapse outweigh the mitigating evidence. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guidelines F, G, and J, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns \nraised by his financial delinquencies, alcohol consumption, and criminal conduct. \nDuring closing statements at the hearing, Applicant\u2019s attorney suggested the \npossibility of a conditional security clearance. Appendix C of SEAD 4 provides that a \nconditional clearance may be granted \u201cdespite the presence of issue information that can \nbe partially but not completely mitigated, with the provision that additional security \nmeasures shall be required to mitigate the issue . . . .\u201d Based on the evidence, I have \nconcluded that Applicant is not a good candidate for a conditional clearance. He provided \nminimal evidence mitigating the financial concerns. Despite completing an extensive \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrehabilitation program in February 2017, he relapsed just before his hearing. He provided \nminimal evidence regarding the content of his most recent treatment, and no evidence of \nan updated diagnosis or prognosis. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.m and 1.o-1.u: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 3, 2018, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F, financial considerations, and Guideline E, personal conduct. The \naction was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 6, 2018, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Following a loss of jurisdiction and \nsubsequent regaining of sponsorship, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfile of relevant material (FORM) on April 30, 2021. Applicant received the FORM on May \n17, 2021, and was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt. The Government\u2019s \nevidence is identified as Items 1 through 8. Applicant did not submit a response to the \nFORM or object to the Government\u2019s documents. Items 1 through 8 are admitted into \nevidence. The case was assigned to me on September 9, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 40 years old. A 1999 high school graduate, Applicant has taken some \ncollege classes, but has not earned a college degree. He served in the U.S. military on \nactive duty from 1999 \u2013 2005, was honorably discharged, and affiliated with the Reserve \nin 2007. In the Reserve, Applicant has mobilized on at least five occasions, including for \na 2007 \u2013 2008 deployment to Iraq. At the time of his background interview in April 2016, \nApplicant was still serving in the Reserve. (Items 3 and 8) Applicant is twice divorced. He \nmarried for the first time in 2000 and divorced in 2004. He married for the second time in \n2004 and divorced in 2014; he has a 16 year-old son from his second marriage. (Item 3) \nApplicant reports one period of unemployment, from June 2005 \u2013 June 2006, after \nhis discharge from active duty and while he was a student. When he rejoined the work \nforce in 2006, he initially worked as a security officer for a private contractor and then as \na police officer for a municipality. From October 2007 through October 2012, Applicant \nwas continuously mobilized. After his most recent mobilization ended in 2012, Applicant \nworked first as a police officer onboard a military installation and subsequently as a \nsecurity officer for three contractors; he is currently sponsored by a federal contractor as \na security officer. (Item 3) \nIn September 2015, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA). \nIn Section 26: Delinquency Involving Enforcement, Applicant disclosed a relatively minor \nchild-support arrearage. In Section 26: Delinquency Involving Routine Accounts, the SCA \nasked if, in the past seven years, Applicant had any bills or debts that were turned over \nto a collection agency; had any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or \ncancelled; or, had any financial obligations that were over 120 days delinquent. Applicant \nresponded \u201cno\u201d to the inquiry. (Item 3) \nThe SOR alleges six debts that accumulated from approximately 2014 to 2016 \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f). Additionally, the SOR alleges that Applicant filed for Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy in July 2016, that it was dismissed in May 2017, and that five additional debts \nincluded in the bankruptcy remain unpaid (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g(1)-1.g(5)). Combined, the eleven \nalleged delinquencies total approximately $71,851 and include credit-card debts totaling \n$18,692, an automobile-loan deficiency of $21,101, a motorcycle-loan deficiency of \n$7,796, and a recreational-vehicle loan deficiency of $11,240. Finally, SOR \u00b6 2.a alleges \nthat Applicant deliberately failed to disclose five specific debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, 1.g(3), \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n1.g(4), and 1.g(5)) when he completed his SCA. (Item 1) These were slightly older debts \nthat were already delinquent, charged off, or in collections when Applicant completed the \nSCA; the other debts alleged became delinquent following completion of the SCA. (Item \n4-6) \nThe allegations are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, credit reports, the \nbankruptcy trustee\u2019s Final Report, and the summary of Applicant\u2019s background interview. \n(Items 2, 4-8) Applicant attributes his financial problems to a bitter divorce and insufficient \nincome. (Item 2) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s April 2016 background interview, the government investigator \nasked Applicant if he was delinquent on any accounts. Applicant confirmed that he was \ndelinquent on his child-support obligations and volunteered that he was also delinquent \non a Military Star card account, but volunteered no other delinquencies. (Item 8) The \ninvestigator then confronted Applicant with the delinquent debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, \n1.f, 1.g(3), 1.g(4), and 1.g(5). Applicant acknowledged all five debts, admitted that he \nknew each was delinquent, and confirmed that creditors and collection agencies had \ncontacted him about the delinquencies. He asserted that his failure to disclose the \ndelinquent debts on his SCA was due to an oversight. (Item 8) Given the totality of the \ncircumstances, I find that Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose the debts on his SCA was \ndeliberate, as he was familiar with the debts when confronted, spoke in detail with the \ninvestigator about each account, and admitted that collection agencies and creditors had \nbeen attempting to contact him. (Item 8) \nAt the close of his interview, Applicant stated his intent to get a second job in the \nsummer of 2016 and to clear the debts by the end of 2016. (Item 8) In July 2016, Applicant \ninstead filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy; it was dismissed for a failure to perform in May \n2017. (Item 7) \nIn Applicant\u2019s June 2018 answer to the SOR, he notes that the debts alleged at \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. and 1.c. are the same delinquency. (Item 2) The credit reports support \nApplicant\u2019s assertion, and I find for the Applicant on SOR \u00b6 1.c. (Items 4, 5, and 6) The \nremaining ten delinquencies total $60,891. In explanation for his debts, Applicant states \nthat he \u201cfell on hard times between the years 2014 \u2013 2016 due to a bitter divorce,\u201d but \nthat he is \u201cback on my feet now.\u201d (Item 2) Applicant provided no information on any action \nhe may have taken to repay the debts and provided no explanation for his failure to \ndisclose delinquencies on his SCA. (Item 2) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n4 \n\n \n \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation (See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has ten delinquent debts that began accumulating in approximately \n2014. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying \nconditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n5 \n\n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to his divorce in October 2014, an event \nlargely beyond his control. When completing his SCA in September 2015, he was put on \nnotice that delinquent debts were of security concern. In his background interview of April \n2016, Applicant was again reminded of the security concerns raised by the debts, as the \ninvestigator confronted him about individual debts. Although Applicant then indicated his \nintent to repay the debts, he has provided no evidence of any actions he has taken in the \nensuing five years to contact any creditor, establish a payment plan, or make payments, \neither before or after receipt of the SOR in June 2018. Moreover, Applicant failed to \nperform in the one remedial action that he did undertake \u2013 that of filing for Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy. I find Applicant did not act responsibly under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) \npartially applies. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to meet his financial obligations casts doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. There is no evidence the problem is under \ncontrol or being resolved. Applicant has not made a good-faith effort to repay his creditors. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(c), and 20(d) do not apply. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nWhen he completed his SCA in September 2015, Applicant was aware that he was \ndelinquent on the five debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.f, 1.g(3), 1.g(4), and 1.g(5). \nAlthough Applicant attributed his failure to disclose the debts to oversight, there is \n6 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsufficient evidence to support application of the above disqualifying condition \u2013 that he \nmade a deliberate decision not to disclose the debts to the Government. When confronted \nwith the debts, Applicant recognized each of them, acknowledged them, discussed them \nin detail with the investigator, and described attempts by creditors to collect on the \naccounts. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom personal conduct. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n17: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nDuring his background interview, Applicant did not volunteer the debts when given \nan opportunity to do so, requiring the investigator to confront him on each individual debt. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply. The Government relies on people to be forthcoming and \nhonest on their SCA, even when it involves derogatory information. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not \napply because deliberately failing to disclose information on an SCA and swearing to its \naccuracy is not a minor offense. I find Applicant\u2019s omissions are serious and cast doubt \non his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines E and F in my \nwhole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those \nguidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is 40 years old. He served honorably in the military for at least 17 years. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his 2014 divorce, but failed to provide \nevidence of any actions to resolve delinquent debts in the years since that divorce. \nIgnoring one\u2019s legal responsibilities for years raises questions about their reliability, good \njudgment, and trustworthiness. Applicant also deliberately failed to disclose the \ndelinquent debts on his SCA. At this juncture, Applicant has not met his burden of \npersuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations, and Guideline E, personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nMoira Modzelewski \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

(Tr. at 15-23, 58, 61-64; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE G) \nApplicant lived with his American girlfriend from 2015 to 2016. She had a \ndaughter (Daughter), an eight-year-old granddaughter (Granddaughter), and a five\u00ad\nyear-old grandson (Grandson). In August 2016, Daughter reported to the police that her \neight-year-old daughter (Granddaughter) had been molested by Applicant. Daughter \ntold the police that she was driving her two children to school when Grandson said to \nGranddaughter: \u201cdo you remember when [Applicant] put medicine on your [child\u2019s slang \nterm for vagina]?\u201d Daughter did not ask her about it before school because she did not \nwant to upset her. After school, she asked Granddaughter what happened when she \nwas at her grandmother\u2019s house and Applicant put medicine on her [child\u2019s slang term \nfor vagina]. (Tr. at 23-24, 64-66; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 5) The following is \nfrom the police report: \nAt that time [Granddaughter] told her mother, while at their house on [two \ndays before the report to the police] she had scraped her knee on a \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nbicycle and had went to lay down on the couch.

Once on the bed \n[Applicant] began to rub lotion on her leg and slowly began to move \nupward. When [Applicant] reached the top of the leg, he then placed his \nhand inside of her panties and began to rub her vagina in an up and down \nmotion ten times. At some point [Applicant] asked [Granddaughter] if she \nwas feeling uncomfortable which she replied yes. [Applicant] then climbed \noff the bed and walked in to the bathroom, which [Granddaughter] was \nable to run out of the room and to the outside where her five year old \nbrother was playing. (GE 5) \nDaughter told the police that her mother had left the children in Applicant\u2019s care \nwhile she went to Walmart. She also told the police that Granddaughter told her that it \nhurt and burned when Applicant touched her vagina. The police recommended that \nDaughter take Granddaughter to a children\u2019s hospital for an examination, and a child \nprotective services (CPS) referral was submitted. A detective was contacted, who \nresponded to the hospital to speak with Daughter and Granddaughter. The detective \nlater reported: \nI have spoken with ADA (presumably Assistant District Attorney) [P] about \nthe case. ADA [P] attempted to gain cooperation from the mother of the \nvictim. The mother refused to allow the victim to testify. After further talks \nwith ADA [P] we both agreed that there is not enough evidence to get a \nconviction without the victim[\u2019]s testimony. I am closing the case due to \nlack of cooperation. (GE 5) \nApplicant adamantly denied any inappropriate contact, sexual or otherwise, with \nGranddaughter. He stated that Daughter did not like him because he was Muslim. He \nstated that she used to call him a terrorist. He stated that she made the incident up in \norder to break up his relationship with her mother. Applicant stated that Daughter \naccomplished her goal because her mother broke up with him after the allegation.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n                                                          \nAnalysis \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern for sexual behavior is set out in AG \u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion \nor judgment. \nThe SOR alleges that \u201cFrom August 2016 through approximately August 2017, \nyou were the subject of a police investigation into an allegation of sexual assault of a \nchild.\u201d Applicant admitted that he was investigated, but denied the sexual assault. An \ninvestigation is not enough to raise a disqualifying condition; I have to make a \ndetermination as to whether Applicant committed the underlying conduct. After \nconsidering all the evidence, including Applicant\u2019s testimony, strong character evidence, \nand that he was never arrested, charged, or convicted of the charge, I find by \nsubstantial evidence1  that he committed the sexual assault on Granddaughter, \nessentially as described in the police report. I considered that Applicant provided a \nmotive for Daughter to fabricate the story. While that is possible, that would mean that \nDaughter was willing, at least initially, to lie to the police, put her daughter through an \n1  Substantial evidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n17-04166 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2019) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less than the \nweight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence \ndoes not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. Federal \nMaritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than \na preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994); ISCR \nCase No. 04-07187 at 5 (App. Bd.

Additionally, the details of the \ncase lend an aspect of believability. I certainly agree with the detective and ADA that \nthe case could not be proven beyond a reasonable doubt without Granddaughter\u2019s \ntestimony. However, it is enough to satisfy the substantial evidence standard. The \nabove disqualifying conditions have been established. \nConditions that could mitigate sexual behavior security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 14. The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \nApplicant adamantly denied any inappropriate contact, sexual or otherwise, with \nGranddaughter. However, having found that he committed a serious sexual offense \nagainst a young girl, his denials only serve to indicate that he is not rehabilitated. \nApplicant is vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, and duress. His behavior continues to \ncast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.2 The above mitigating \nconditions are not applicable. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during the national \nsecurity investigative or adjudicative processes. \n2 See ISCR Case No. 09-03233 (App. Bd. Aug. 12, 2010).

The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing; \n(2) while in another country, engaging in any activity that is illegal in \nthat country; \n(3) while in another country, engaging in any activity that, while \nlegal there, is illegal in the United States. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns. The following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant met foreign women online and provided them money. He was engaged \nto one woman from Morocco and married another Moroccan woman. He indicated that \nhe gave some of the women money to help them through difficult times, including two \nsisters in Tunisia whose mother had cancer. There is no evidence that Applicant broke \nany laws or did anything inherently wrong. Department Counsel argued that the conduct \nshowed poor judgment. Applicant is now married. The conduct has not been repeated. I \nam not convinced that the conduct raises any specific disqualifying condition under AG \n\u00b6 16. I am convinced that any security concerns raised by the conduct are mitigated \nunder AG \u00b6 17. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines D and E in my whole-person analysis. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nThis is a difficult case because Applicant has an impressive record of service to \nthe United States. However, the protection of the national security is the paramount \nconsideration, and I am required to resolve any doubt in favor of the national security. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that personal \nconduct security concerns are mitigated, but Applicant did not mitigate the sexual \nbehavior security concerns. \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline D:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

He stated the reason he failed to file was because he \u201cdid not \nhave the money due to unemployment to file or pay.\u201d He estimated he owed about $1,000. \nHe also stated: \u201cI actually think I am owed a refund for that year but just found out [about] \nthis.\u201d (GE 1) \nApplicant was interviewed by a Government investigator in September 2017. \nDuring his interview his tax issues were discussed. He told the investigator that in early \n2017, he was notified by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that he owed approximately \n$6,000 or $7,000 in federal income taxes for tax year 2006 and approximately $1,000 for \ntax year 2010. He inadvertently disclosed on his SCA that he failed to file and pay taxes \nfor tax year 2007. That was incorrect and it should have been 2006. He told the \ninvestigator that the IRS indicated that he had not filed his 2006 return. He believed he \nhad filed it while he was deployed to Iraq, but could not recall the date. Through a military \nprogram at the base, those serving as contractors and military personnel were provided \na service for assisting them in filing their tax returns, but they were responsible for mailing \nthem. He stated to the investigator that he had a refund owed to him of approximately \n$6,000, and he elected to have it applied to his next year\u2019s tax return as he expected he \nwould owe taxes the following year. He said he was never contacted by the IRS until 2017 \nand was unaware that the 2006 return was not filed. He asked the IRS what he could do \nand was advised to pay 20% of the balance owed, which would be a payment of $1,000 \neach month. He could not afford this payment. He told the investigator the IRS would not \naccept smaller payments. He said that he was in the process of resolving the issue. He \nsaid that the majority of his archived files were in storage, but he intended to retrieve all \nof the files and documentation in order to file his tax returns. He intended to try and have \nthe issue resolved by the end of 2017. He believed that once the late return was filed, he \nanticipated having a refund which would counterbalance what is being identified as owed \nby the IRS. If he owed taxes, he intended to set up a payment plan with the IRS to ensure \nthe amount was paid. (GE 2) \nAt his hearing, Applicant testified that he was due a refund for tax year 2006 \nbecause he had been overseas, and he used the IRS \u201cpreliminary check service\u201d to \nforecast that he would receive a $6,000 refund. He wanted this prospective refund applied \nto his 2007 income taxes. He said he was advised that the overseas tax benefit only \napplied if one was out of the country for 335 days, and it was not prorated. He believed \nhe would owe taxes in 2007, so this is why he chose to have his 2006 refund applied to \nhis 2007 taxes. He explained that he believed he had an extra year to file if he was out of \nthe country and owed taxes and three years if he was due a refund. He said he filed his \n2006 tax return. It was determined he filed his 2006 tax return in August 2008. He said \nthe IRS never received his 2006 income tax return. He did not keep a copy of the return \nbecause it was past seven years. In 2019, he was on notice that his hearing was to be \nscheduled sometime after October 2019, when he returned from overseas. He said he \ntried contacting the IRS for a copy of the return, but was unsuccessful.

He put this debt on the \u201cback burner\u201d and had not paid \nit. He intended to resolve it along with the 2006 tax issue. He intended to resolve this \nissue and pay what he owed by the end of 2017. (GE 2) \nAt his hearing, Applicant testified that he could not verify the date he had filed his \n2010 tax return. He said it was a mistake when he said he had not filed, but rather he had \nfiled, but cannot prove it. He could not recall if he had filed before his 2017 interview or \nafter it. He then said he filed it when he returned to the country in 2011, but the IRS \ninformed him right before his 2017 interview that it did not have his 2010 tax return, and \nhe needed to file again. He said he tried to file again, but the IRS would not accept it \nbecause the statute of limitations had run. He said he was told by the IRS that \u201cwe don\u2019t \nneed them, they already assessed.\u201d (Tr. 40-42) He said he then re-filed sometime in 2018. \nHe did not save any of this information because he said it was past the statute of \nlimitations. He testified that he was unaware he owed taxes for 2010 until he was \ninterviewed by the government investigator in 2017. This is inconsistent with his \ndisclosures in his SCA. (Tr. 39-48, 56, 58-61; GE 2) \nApplicant told the investigator that he wanted to focus on resolving his federal tax \ndebt with the IRS before addressing other debts that he had at the time. He volunteered \nto work overseas so he could increase his income and use the money to resolve his debts. \n(GE 2) \nApplicant testified that he contacted the IRS in June 2021 and was told that the \nstatute of limitations had run on the tax years in question. He said that the IRS was able \nto confirm that he filed his Federal income tax returns for tax year 2006 in 2008, but it \nwould take ten week for him to receive the transcript from the IRS. The IRS was unable \nto confirm he had filed his 2010 return. He stated: \u201cThey also have no record I didn\u2019t file.\u201d \nHe further stated: \u201cI tried to file, and follow the rules, and they said that they could not \naccept them, because it was too late.\u201d He then stated he could not remember what tax \nservice he used to file the return, but was told when it attempted to file electronically the \nreturn was kicked back. (Tr. 52-54, 58, AE G) \nPost-hearing Applicant provided a copy of the 2006 Federal income tax transcript \nthat was requested on June 10, 2021 and the response date was the same. The \ntranscripts shows his 2006 return was filed in August 2008 and he owed $7,814. Penalties \nand interest were added. His 2007 federal tax refund was applied to the 2006 balance \nowed. The transcript notes that a \u201ccollection due process notice of intent to levy \u2013return \nreceipt signed\u201d was issued on November 13, 2008.

(AE O) \nThe SOR does not allege Applicant failed to pay his 2006 or 2010 federal income \ntaxes. It only alleges he failed to timely file the returns. His failure to pay his taxes and \nany reference to delinquent tax debts will not be considered for disqualifying purposes, \nbut may be considered when analyzing the whole-person, in making a credibility \ndetermination, and in mitigation. \nApplicant testified that because of his divorce in 2006 there was some confusion \nabout who would file the tax return that year. He further testified that he had an automatic \nextension to file his 2010 federal tax return because he was working as a contractor \noverseas. He said he filed the return, but the IRS had no record. He said he throws his \npaperwork out after seven years. He included a document from the IRS to show he does \nnot have a balance owed for tax years 2018 through 2021. It did not show if he timely \nfiled his 2010 federal tax return. He indicated that the statute of limitations had run on his \n2010 tax returns, which may or may not be true, but it is irrelevant regarding whether he \ntimely filed his tax returns for purposes of his security clearance eligibility. He stated that \nthe documents show he does not owe anything to the IRS, and it would have withheld \nrefunds. This may be accurate, but speculative. If he filed on time and owed money, future \nrefunds could be applied to a balance owed. The fact he has no balance for 2018 to 2020, \ndoes not show that he filed his 2010 tax return on time. He failed to provide a credible \nexplanation for the contradictory statements he made on his SCA and to the government \ninvestigator. He testified that the IRS \u201cdon\u2019t have any records of 2010 whatsoever,\u201d which \ncorroborates either they were not filed or they were lost. Back in 2017, Applicant was \ngoing to contact the IRS and resolve the matter. Four years have passed since then and \nnow he states he cannot retrieve the documents because they are older than ten years. \n(Tr. 25-29, 62-63) \nApplicant failed to provide the tax transcript for 2010. He provided a document from \nthe IRS to show years the transcripts are available. The document he provided from 2021 \nshows transcripts were available for tax years 2011 to 2021, the past ten years. He did \nnot provide an explanation for why he could request and receive in June 2021 the \ncomputer generated 2006 transcript and not the 2010 transcript. He explained in a written \nstatement that he was told by two tax professionals that if he used the paper Form 4506 \nto request the 2010 tax transcript he would not receive it by the date the record closed. \nApplicant did not explain why he failed to resolve the issue in 2017, as he stated he would \nand when it was within the ten years.

(AE A, B, D, H, L) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record.

Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns.

There \nis sufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying condition. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s 2006 tax transcript shows he filed his federal income tax return late. \nApplicant failed to show he timely filed his 2010 federal income tax return. After his \nhearing, he provided a copy of the tax return he filed for 2010 and mailed in June 2021. \nApplicant disclosed his tax issues on his 2017 SCA. He told the government investigator \nhe would resolve the issue by the end of 2017. He did not and now relies on his inability \nto obtain documents because ten years has passed and the statute of limitations has \ntolled. He also told the investigator that his documents were in storage, and he was going \nto retrieve them and resolve the issue. He did not. Instead he testified that he does not \nkeep documents past seven years. At the time the issue arose, it was within seven years. \nIt is disingenuous to destroy documents that may have pertained to 2010 when he put the \ngovernment on notice that he had the issue in 2017. It is unknown why he could provide \ncomputerized 2006 tax transcripts, but could not provide 2010 tax transcripts. He did not \nprovide any documents from the IRS corroborating any action he may have taken in the \npast regarding resolving his 2010 tax return. \nApplicant\u2019s recently filed his Federal income tax return for 2010. His failure to \ntimely resolve the issue casts doubt on his reliability, good judgment, and trustworthiness. \nHis tax issues were not beyond his control. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20 (a) and 20(b) do not apply. Applicant \nprovided documents to show he filed his 2010 Federal tax return and mailed it to the IRS \non June 19, 2021. AG \u00b6 20(g) applies. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant neglected to timely file his Federal income tax returns for 2006 and 2010. \nApplicant claimed he was in compliance for both years, but the evidence does not support \nhis claims. Relying on the statute of limitations does not show he has acted responsibly \nin resolving the issues he disclosed about his tax problems. Applicant provided \ncontradictory statements. He had years after he completed his SCA to resolve the \nproblems, but failed to do so. Applicant has the burden of persuasion. Despite some \nevidence of mitigation, it is insufficient to overcome his failure to timely resolve his tax \nissues. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has held that: \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including unpaid payroll taxes, \nunfiled tax returns, and delinquent debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nApplicant is only an authorized user on the accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and \n1.l, and not legally responsible for the debts. Those allegations are concluded for \nApplicant. \n \nThe $62 debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.m are duplicate accounts. When the \nsame conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the \nduplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005). SOR \u00b6 1.m is concluded for Applicant. \nThe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.i through 1.j total $352 and include two \nmedical debts and two small telecommunications debts. Those debts are old and do not \ngenerate current security concerns. Those allegations are concluded for Applicant. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n \nApplicant\u2019s tax problems go back to before July 2011, when the IRS filed a \n$158,470 federal tax lien against his corporation. He still owes the IRS for the payroll \ntaxes, and he has not filed his 2011 through 2015 federal and state income tax returns. \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with abiding by \nwell-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with rules and \nsystems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-\n01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted \naccess to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May \n16, 2018).  \nApplicant owes more than $36,000 for a credit card debt that is the subject of \nlitigation (SOR \u00b6 1.d) and about $1,650 for two other debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.h). He \nmade assertions about paying his taxes and other debts, but he did not provide \ndocumentation. The Appeal Board has held that \u201cit is reasonable for a Judge to expect \napplicants to present documentation about the satisfaction of specific debts.\u201d See ISCR \nCase No. 09-07091 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 11, 2010) (quoting ISCR Case No. 04-10671 at \n3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2006)). Additionally, he stated that he was working to settle the large \ncredit card debt, pay the rest of his taxes and other debts, and file his back tax returns. \nHowever, intentions to resolve financial problems in the future are not a substitute for a \ntrack record of debt repayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. \n11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nThere is insufficient evidence for a determination that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or made a good-faith effort to pay his taxes and \ndebts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that the security concerns \narising out of Applicant\u2019s unpaid taxes, unfiled income tax returns, and delinquent debts \nare not mitigated. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant did not intentionally provide false information about his finances on his \n2016 SF 86. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not applicable. SOR \u00b6 2.a is concluded for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E and F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude personal conduct \nsecurity concerns were not established, but Applicant did not mitigate the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i-1.m: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

Based upon a \nreview of the record as a whole, national security eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \nHistory of Case \nOn June 11, 2014, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF 86). On March 26, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \ndetailing security concerns under Guideline I (Psychological Conditions). The action was \ntaken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines for national security eligibility effective within \nthe DoD on June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on March 26, 2019. He retained an attorney to assist \nhim in responding to the SOR on April 10, 2019. That attorney requested an extension of \ntime to respond to the SOR. Having not received notice that the extension had been \napproved, Applicant personally responded to the SOR in writing on April 19, 2019 \n(Answer), without the assistance of his attorney. He admitted each of the SOR \nallegations, with explanations, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. \nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the case to me on June \n20, 2019. I attempted to schedule Applicant\u2019s hearing during September 2019, but his \ncounsel requested a continuance, which I granted. On September 17, 2019, Applicant \nand his counsel submitted an amended SOR response (Response) to \u201cfurther clarify\u201d and \nsupplement his Answer. (See Transcript at 81-89.) DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing to \nApplicant\u2019s counsel on October 15, 2019, setting the hearing for November 7, 2019. His \ncounsel responded on the same day with a letter advising that she was immediately \nwithdrawing from any further representation of Applicant.  \n \n \nAt his hearing on November 7, 2019, Applicant explained that he had chosen not \nto pay the fees that his attorney would have required to represent him during the hearing, \nand that he wished to proceed pro se. I found him to be capable of self-representation, \nand his election to be knowing and voluntary. Department Counsel offered Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 4 into evidence. GE 1 through 3 were admitted without objection. \nApplicant objected to the admission of GE 4 because he disagreed with some of its \ncontents. GE 4 was admitted into evidence over this objection, with the assurance that \nany contradictory, supplementary, or corroborative evidence would also be fully \nconsidered. Applicant testified and offered Applicant Exhibits A through G, which were \nadmitted without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to leave the record open until \nNovember 21, 2019, for submission of additional evidence. On November 18, 2019, \nApplicant submitted AE H, which was admitted into the record without objection. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on November 26, 2019.  \n \n    Findings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is 53 years old. He has worked for a major aerospace company since \nMarch 2014 as a mission systems engineer, and applied for a security clearance in \nconnection with that employment. He graduated from high school in 1985, and earned a \nbachelor of science degree in 1999. He completed his master\u2019s degree in electrical \nengineering in 2013, and suspended his participation in an engineering Ph.D. program \nwhen he relocated to accept his current position. He is recently married and has no \nchildren. (Answer; Response; GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 87, 104, 113.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents divorced when he was an adolescent. They, and Applicant\u2019s \nsiblings, all moved away and left him to live with family friends until he graduated from \nhigh school in 1985. He joined the Army shortly thereafter, but was separated from the \nservice with an uncharacterized entry-level discharge for \u201cfailure to adapt,\u201d before \ncompleting his initial training. For the next six or seven years he was unemployed and \nhomeless, surviving through public assistance and crime while increasingly abusing \nvarious drugs. He does not remember specific dates and details of this period of his life, \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant reported that he lived in California from 2002 to 2008, then in Arizona \nfrom 2008 to March 2014, all in Federally subsidized Section 8 rental housing. From 2002 \nto 2010, he was unemployed or worked in short-term temporary-placement-agency jobs. \nHe then entered graduate school at a major state university, pursuing a master\u2019s degree. \nHis drug abuse stopped when he obtained the Section 8 housing, but he continued to \npursue mental health treatment, which allowed him to qualify for vocational rehabilitation \nprogram benefits and to continue receiving SSI. In Arizona, during 2008, he started with \na new outpatient mental health counseling service so he could continue to receive \nmedications. In 2010, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder by his treating psychiatric \nnurse practitioner (NP). His medical records reflect continuous and successful \nparticipation in treatment until 2013, when the time demands of finishing his master\u2019s \ndegree prevented his regular attendance. (Answer; Response;  AE D; AE G; Tr. 23, 52-\n53, 61, 66, 72, 78-79, 97, 113-121, 128.) \n \n \nDuring a therapy session in 2013, Applicant discussed the emerging technologies \nthat permit \u201csmart\u201d televisions to collect and send information about people to data-\ncollection companies. This was a subject that had come up during his electrical \nengineering studies. He did not consider it to be a personal problem, because he \nconsidered himself not to be important enough for anyone to be spying on him, and it did \nnot lead to a diagnosis of, or treatment for, paranoia. He adamantly denied ever having, \nor reporting, thoughts of harming himself, as alleged in the SOR. The record medical \nevidence corroborates the absence of any such reports. (GE 3; GE 4; AE D; AE G; Tr. \n70-78, 91-92, 122-125.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbut confirmed that it included several periods of incarceration, several inpatient \nadmissions in a psychiatric hospital unit for mental health treatment, and a year of \nresidence in a large \u201cunlocked residential facility . . . for adults with mental illness . . . \n[where] residents are allowed to come and go freely and are afforded the same rights as \nall other Americans.\u201d It was only in that residential facility that he was ever diagnosed, \nvaguely, with a schizoaffective disorder; and he paid for this arrangement by signing over \nall of his resulting Supplemental Security Income (SSI) disability benefits, while receiving \nback a small stipend. After living there for a year, he moved into a motel across the street \nwhere he could retain a larger portion of his SSI funds. (GE 1; GE 2; GE 3; AE A; AE D; \nAE E; Tr. 43-45, 108-113.)   \nAfter completing his master\u2019s degree, Applicant was accepted into the engineering \nPh.D. program at the same university. Again, academic demands on his time prevented \nhim from fully participating in continued treatment at the counselling service. However, \nthe service\u2019s records indicate that he returned for significant periods of counselling until \nhe decided to leave school for his current employment in 2014. As part of his decision-\nmaking process, and aware that he would need to apply for a security clearance, he \nconsulted with NP concerning the potential for psychological issues to raise security \nconcerns. She assured him that his mental health was under good control and that she \nwould certify that there was no current basis for such concerns. She, in fact, did provide \na positive prognosis to that effect. Before that time and under her direction, he had \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nOn April 8, 2018, at the request of the DoD CAF, a licensed clinical psychologist \nperformed a psychological evaluation of Applicant. She issued her report on April 18, \n2018. (GE 4) She based this report and her opinions on some investigatory records \nprovided by the DoD CAF, her clinical interview and observations, and the results of the \nPersonality Assessment Inventory (PAI) that she had Applicant complete. Although she \nwas provided Applicant\u2019s release of information authorization to speak with NP, she chose \nnot to contact NP because she considered her review of the records provided by the DoD \nCAF to be sufficient for purposes of her assessment. Most of the allegations in the SOR \nare based on comments in this report, several of which are factually incorrect. For \ninstance, she states that he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder with psychotic features, \nwhich appears nowhere else in his extensive medical records. (GE 4; AE C; AE D; AE G; \nTr. 52, 56, 62-72, 90-91, 121.)   \n \n \nA complete analysis of GE 4 reveals that the selectively quoted language \ncontained in the SOR portrays a misunderstanding of the evaluation\u2019s results and report. \nPertinent sections of the report state:  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nstopped taking any psychiatric medications. (Answer; Response; AE G; Tr. 60-62, 70, \n126-129.) \nOverall, [Applicant\u2019s] clinical profile on the PAI did not result in any \nelevations that would be indicative of clinically significant mental health \nissues, despite his mental health and treatment history. Due to [Applicant\u2019s] \napparent guardedness and positive impression management . . . diagnostic \nimpressions were unable to be yielded through the PAI. . . . The validity of \npersonality \ntesting \nis subsequently questionable, \nand diagnostic \nimpressions were unable to be determined.   \nNevertheless, the psychologist neither performed any additional testing nor contacted NP \nto discuss Applicant\u2019s most recent course of mental health treatment. She expressed \nconcern that Applicant\u2019s symptoms might recur in the absence of ongoing psychotropic \nmedication, although he had been functioning well without any formal treatment or \nrecurrence of symptoms since 2014. Her formally stated diagnosis, \u201c(per applicant \nreport),\u201d  was: Schizoaffective Disorder, Bipolar Type, Multiple Episodes, currently in full \nremission R/O Bipolar Disorder, with Psychotic Features, currently in full remission. (Note: \nR/O (Rule Out) is a common, but not formally proper, way of saying that there is not \nsufficient evidence to make the diagnosis but it might be worth exploring further to rule it \nout.) She concluded that his prognosis was guarded, given his current lack of mental \nhealth services. (GE 4.)   \nAlthough he continued to function well, both personally and professionally, \nApplicant sought mental health treatment from a highly qualified psychiatrist starting June \n4, 2019, to address the DoD CAF\u2019s concerns regarding his national security eligibility. \nShe diagnosed Applicant with Adjustment Disorder with anxious features, stemming from \nfear of losing his job. She reported that she does not believe he has a thought disorder \n(schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder), or bipolar affective disorder.

(AE F.) \nApplicant has continued a regular and successful course of treatment with this psychiatrist \nevery two weeks since June 2019. (AE H; Tr. 79-80, 129-130.) \nApplicant\u2019s performance evaluations reflect excellent performance with no mention \nof any behavioral or psychological issues. He is now married, owns a home, and lives a \nstable and responsible life. (Answer; Response; AE F.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and \nmitigating conditions. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing \nthe complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(b) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of \na number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility be resolved in favor of the national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation \nor conjecture. \nAccording to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to \nestablish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 requires that the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants eligibility \nfor access to classified information or assignment in sensitive duties. Decisions include, \nby necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk \nof compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides, \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to \nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, \nSection 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \nThe security concern relating to this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nAG \u00b6 28 contains five conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Four conditions were raised by the allegations in Applicant\u2019s SOR: \n(a) behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that may \nindicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but not \nlimited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, manipulative, \nimpulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre behaviors;  \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization; and \n(d) failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a diagnosed \npsychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take \nprescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling sessions. \n \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant admittedly had a lengthy history of diagnosed behavioral and mental \nhealth problems, many of which were related to his substance abuse several decades \nago. He underwent several periods of voluntary inpatient hospitalization for these \nproblems. At the end of his postgraduate education, he did not fully comply with his \nprevious treatment program, resulting in several periods of disenrollment and re-\nenrollment. These facts raise prima facie concerns under the foregoing disqualifying \nconditions, and shift the burden to Applicant to establish mitigation. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 29 contains five conditions that could mitigate psychological \nsecurity concerns. Four of them apply in this case: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan;  \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condi\n \ntion that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently \nreceiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly \nqualified mental health professional; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nApplicant has a lengthy record of seeking and benefitting from mental health \ntreatment to address symptoms and concerns that were present at the time. After \nconcluding his academic career and beginning his current employment, he found no need \nfor ongoing treatment since he was functioning well. However, the concerns alleged in \nthe SOR caused him to resume regular mental health ltreatment with a highly qualified \npsychiatrist, who reports that there is no indication of a current problem outside his anxiety \nover possibly losing his job should he not achieve national security eligibility. She \ncontinues to successfully monitor and help him manage his mental health, and provides \na favorable prognosis based on their ongoing course of treatment. Her diagnosis and \nprognosis are far more credible and recent than the one-day assessment provided to the \nDoD CAF in the clinical psychologist\u2019s 2018 report. Applicant\u2019s prior symptoms are fully \nresolved and under control. There is no indication of a current psychological or psychiatric \nproblem. Full mitigation of the formerly valid psychological concerns was established \nunder AG \u00b6\u00b6 29(a), (b), (d), and (e). \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct \nand all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature person, who has \novercome severe problems he experienced during the 1980s and 1990s. He \ndemonstrated rehabilitation through a successful course of education in a highly \ndemanding field, and more than six years of successful employment. Any potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress has been ameliorated, and the likelihood of \nrecurrence is minimal due to his ongoing participation in psychiatric treatment. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole-person, I conclude Applicant met his burden to \nmitigate the psychological security concerns raised by the facts of this case. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.f: \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                      \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nclassified information. National security eligibility is granted. \nDAVID M. WHITE \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

FORM Items \n1 and 2 are the SOR and Applicant\u2019s Answer (with attachments, as noted). Item 3 is \nApplicant\u2019s e-QIP. Item 4 is a document containing the summaries of Applicant\u2019s two \nbackground interviews. Item 4 is the subject of the two remands from the Appeal Board, \nas discussed below.

Her admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 37 years old. She was married from 2010 to 2016. She has three \nchildren, ages 4, 8, and 13. (AE E at 1) She graduated from high school in 2001. In \n2017, she earned a certification in medical billing from an online university. She is \ncurrently pursuing professional certification in project management and a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree. (AE E) \nApplicant has worked for several years with a defense contractor at a military \nhospital. From 2010 to 2016, she worked in one position there full time, under various \ncontracts. Between 2013 and 2015, she also held a part-time job there, working nights \nand weekends. The part-time position ended when that employer lost its contract. In \nMarch 2016, Applicant also lost her full-time position, for a similar reason. At the time, \nApplicant was on maternity leave. (Item 3; AE E) \nApplicant was then unemployed until December 2017, when she was hired by \nher current employer, for another job at the same military hospital. She has remained in \nthat job for the last three years. She earns about $60,000 annually. She seeks to retain \nher eligibility for access to sensitive information. (AE; Item 3) \nApplicant listed several debts on her e-QIP application. She fell behind on her \ndebts because she experienced difficult pregnancies, leading to significant time away \nfrom work on maternity leave. She noted that she had not been able to pay her debts \nsince her difficult pregnancies, but hoped that renewed employment would allow her to \ndo so. She noted that she had considered bankruptcy and had contacted a debt-relief \nagency.

Applicant\u2019s vehicle was totaled in the accident, so she \npurchased another car. (AE E) \nApplicant gave additional background information about her debts and financial \nsituation in her FORM response. She noted that she had been out of work for a period \nbefore finding her current position with a military health care provider. She intended to \nbegin returning to financial stability by paying household bills and loans given to her by \nfamily members. She is willing to work out reasonable payment plans. (AE D) \nApplicant also asserted that all of the collection accounts had been cleared from \nher credit report and that more than half of the debt alleged in her SOR had been paid \nand resolved. She noted that only the large auto collection debt (SOR \u00b6 1.d) remains. \nHowever, she provided no additional corroborating documentation. She said she had \nresumed her academic studies. She had researched her financial options and planned \nto take appropriate action available to her having found stable employment. (AE D) \nApplicant\u2019s alleged debts total about $42,930. Most of them are consumer and \nmedical debts. The largest debt, for $27,209, relates to an auto purchase. The debts are \nestablished by the Government\u2019s evidence, which includes credit reports from June \n2018 and December 2017 (Items 8, 9) and public records concerning certain judgments \n(Items 5, 6, 10), and by Applicant\u2019s admissions in her Answer and on her e-QIP. (Items \n2, 3) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is an $803 judgment entered in 2013 relating to a past-due medical \ndebt for $803. (Item 5) The debt relates to expenses incurred by Applicant during her \npregnancy and childbirth. (Item 3 at 36-37) Applicant noted in her Answer that she \nresearched the debt with the court, the creditor\u2019s attorney and the medical creditor, \nwhose office was closed. She said she was told by the attorney\u2019s office that they were \nno longer collecting on the debt, though it remained on her credit report. (Item 2) In her \nmost recent submission, Applicant provided a screenshot of the docket list for the case, \nwith a notation that she attempted to challenge the debt in court in November 2019. (AE \nJ) The debt remains pending.  \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a judgment for $4,574, filed against Applicant in 2016. (Items 6, 7) It \nrelates to an auto accident. She explained that her car slid on ice at a red light while she \nwas on her way to work. (AE D at 12; Item 3 at 36-37) Applicant reported in her Answer \nthat she had been making monthly payments on the debt, but this is undocumented. \n(Item 2) Most recently, she explained that she defaulted on payments on the debt once \nbefore, and her driver\u2019s license was suspended. She contacted the (creditor\u2019s) attorney \nand requested to lower her payments due to the COVID-19 pandemic. She intends to \nfinish paying the bill by 2021 if she remains employed.

Applicant reported this debt \non her e-QIP, noting that it was for the purchase of the vehicle she financed after \ntotaling her first car in the accident. (Item 3 at 43-44) She said that the car was \nexpensive but suitable for her growing family. She could afford the monthly payment \nwith her part-time income, but she lost that income when she was laid off. The car was \nlater repossessed. (AE A, AE E at 4, 13) \nIn her most recent submission, Applicant detailed that she was asked by the \ncreditor to make six monthly payments of $691 before they would offer a settlement, \nand she was unable to do so. More recently, she has an offer to make six monthly \npayments of $100, for a 50% reduction on the debt. Payments began in November \n2020, and the balance is now $25,121. (AE E at 12, AE H, AE I) The 50% reduction \noffer from the creditor is undocumented. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is a charged-off debt for $3,776. (Item 8 at 2; Item 9 at 6) This is for \nunpaid rent for an old lease that ended in October 2015. Applicant admits the debt, but \ndisputes that she owes the full amount (for two month\u2019s rent, instead of only one), and \ndisputes that she broke the lease. She asserts that the debt has been removed from her \ncredit reports. (AE E at 12-13) It is not listed on her most recent credit report (AE K) but \nno payments towards the debt are documented. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f is a consumer debt in collection for $882.

(AE E at 15) \nApplicant noted in her most recent submission that she intends to continue \nworking on paying down her debts, so she can advance professionally and provide \nfinancial stability for herself and her family. (AE E) \nA close friend and co-worker wrote a recommendation letter for Applicant, noting \nthat she had overcome many obstacles, including difficult pregnancies, loss of income, \nand ongoing physical therapy after her auto accident. (AE F) In a separate reference \nletter, Applicant\u2019s supervisor attests that she is a reliable employee. (AE G) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance, or, as here, \nto a determination of public trust. As the Supreme Court held in Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988), \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that \n[trustworthiness] determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nsensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThe financial considerations guideline sets forth several conditions that could \nraise trustworthiness concerns under AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred several debts, including medical debts, consumer debts, \nunpaid rent, a debt related to a vehicle, and other debts, that became delinquent during \na period of limited income, medical issues, and unemployment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) \napply. \nConditions that could mitigate financial considerations trustworthiness concerns \nare provided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \nMost of Applicant\u2019s debts are paid and resolved. Some larger debts remain, so \nher financial delinquencies are ongoing. Applicant is still paying her delinquencies, \nwhich remain ongoing. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. AG \u00b6 20(c) partially applies, as \nApplicant pursued financial advice in weighing bankruptcy and debt relief in considering \nher various options in resolving her debts. \nApplicant\u2019s debts, however are all due to, or exacerbated by, a variety of \ncircumstances, including difficult pregnancies, an auto accident, and job instability. \nThese are circumstances beyond her control that have impacted her ability to pay her \ndebts and to stay afloat financially. The first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) therefore applies. For \nfull application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must establish that she has acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. For most of the last 10 years, she has been gainfully \nemployed at the same military hospital, with multiple employers. For a period of time, \nshe worked two jobs. More recently, while on maternity leave, she lost both positions, \nthrough no fault of her own, when her employers lost their contracts. Applicant is also \nraising three children as a single mother on a $60,000 annual income. In considering \nApplicant\u2019s actions, I take into account that she has never really had much opportunity \nto make a concerted effort to pay off her debts, by making regular payments through \nestablished payment plans. In light of the steps she has taken to pay some of her \ndelinquent debts and her plan to continue paying her debts with her limited surplus \nincome, I conclude that the trustworthiness concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s delinquent \ndebts are mitigated under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and AG 20(d). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of public trust by considering the totality of the \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nposition of public trust must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. I credit Applicant\u2019s 10 years of employment \n(with breaks in service due to circumstances beyond her control). Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s continued eligibility for \na public trust position. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.u:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant continued eligibility for a public trust \nposition.

Additionally, as of June 7, 2019, Applicant allegedly owed delinquent federal taxes of $22,834 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); state X taxes of at least $2,629 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); a credit-card collection debt of $460 (SOR \u00b6 1.e); $103,715 on a bank loan (student loan) that was $2,055 past due (SOR \u00b6 1.f); federal student loans in collection for $1,760 (SOR \u00b6 1.g) and $5,837 (SOR \u00b6 1.h); $28,350 on a federal tax lien from December 2009 (SOR \u00b6 1.i); wireless phone debts in collection for $725 (SOR \u00b6 1.j) and $928 (SOR \u00b6 1.k); and a utility debt in collection for $439 (SOR \u00b6 1.l).

On \nJanuary 29, 2020, he submitted a notarized response to the SOR allegations, and he \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA). Referral of the case to the Hearing Office was delayed because of \nthe COVID pandemic. On February 17, 2021, Department Counsel indicated that the \nGovernment was ready to proceed to a hearing. On March 8, 2021, the case was assigned \nto me to conduct a hearing to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the national \nsecurity interests of the United States to grant or continue a security clearance for \nApplicant. I received the case assignment and file on March 12, 2021. On March 15, 2021, \nand again on April 20, 2021, I informed Applicant of the possibility of an online video \nhearing. Applicant\u2019s counsel entered his appearance on April 21, 2021. Following a \nsuccessful test of the Defense Collaboration Services (DCS) system on April 27, 2021, I \nissued a notice scheduling Applicant\u2019s DCS video teleconference hearing for May 25, \n2021. \nThe online hearing was held as scheduled. Four Government exhibits (GEs 1-4) and \nsix Applicant exhibits (AEs A-F), each containing several documents, were admitted into \nthe record without any objections. Documents Applicant submitted with his SOR Answer \nwere not offered by Applicant, and his attorney asked that I not consider them, so they \nwere not reviewed for content. A March 11, 2021 letter forwarding discovery of the GEs to \nApplicant was accepted as a hearing exhibit (HE 1) in the record. Applicant testified, as \nreflected in a hearing transcript (Tr.) received on June 15, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy that \nwas discharged in January 2009 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and he failed to timely file his federal and \nstate income tax returns for tax years 2007 through 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Additionally, as of \nJune 7, 2019, Applicant allegedly owed delinquent federal taxes of $22,834 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); \nstate X taxes of at least $2,629 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); a credit-card collection debt of $460 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.e); $103,715 on a bank loan (student loan) that was $2,055 past due (SOR \u00b6 1.f); federal \nstudent loans in collection for $1,760 (SOR \u00b6 1.g) and $5,837 (SOR \u00b6 1.h); $28,350 on a \nfederal tax lien from December 2009 (SOR \u00b6 1.i); wireless phone debts in collection for \n$725 (SOR \u00b6 1.j) and $928 (SOR \u00b6 1.k); and a utility debt in collection for $439 (SOR \u00b6 1.l). \nUnder Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to have deliberately falsified his September 27, \n2017 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) (hereafter SF 86) by \nfalsely denying that he had failed to file federal or state tax returns or pay federal or state \ntaxes when required by law in the preceding seven years (SOR \u00b6 2.a) and by failing to \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndisclose that he had a federal lien against him for failing to pay taxes or other debts and by \ndenying that he was currently delinquent on any federal debt (SOR \u00b6 2.b). \nWhen he responded to the SOR, Applicant admitted the bankruptcy discharge, the \nfailure to file his income tax returns, the tax lien, the delinquent debts, and the deliberate \nomission of his tax issues from his SF 86. As for the debts, he stated that he had \nestablished payment plans for the following debts: the state-tax delinquency, which he \nindicated was currently $1,826 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); the credit-card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.e); the \neducational loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f-1.h), which he had consolidated and no longer considered in \ndefault; the federal taxes (SOR \u00b6 1.i); and the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j-1.k, which he planned to \nrepay pursuant to settlement agreements. He stated that he no longer owed the utility debt \nin SOR \u00b6 1.l because it had been written off. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and \ntranscript, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 49-year-old electrical draftsman and designer, who has worked for a \ndefense contractor since December 2017. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 33.) He has never married and \nhas no children. He has lived in a house owned by his mother, rent-free, since January \n2008, except for a brief period from March 2013 to June 2013, when he rented in another \nstate. (GE 1; AE A; Tr. 39.) His mother pays the taxes, homeowner\u2019s insurance, and \nutilities on the house. (Tr. 39.) \nApplicant earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in architecture in June 2003. (GE 1; Tr. 34.) \nAbout six months later, he began working at a university. About two years later, he began \nworking primarily in computer-aided design (CAD) in the architectural building industry, and \nhe continued in this occupation until the economic downturn in 2008. He worked for smaller \nfirms and went from job to job easily, trying to acquire the skills and experience needed to \nbecome a licensed architect. (Tr. 35-36.) He bought a two-family home in the spring of \n2006, which he financed for $240,000. (Tr. 36-37.) He struggled to pay his mortgage, \nespecially after his renters moved out, and he eventually defaulted on his loan. He \nabandoned the property in about January 2008 and moved into a home owned by his \nmother. (Tr. 38-39.) \nAfter the mortgage crisis hit, Applicant had only temporary jobs that lasted a few \nweeks to a few months between August 2008 and January 2013. He was not eligible for \nunemployment compensation because he had been a temporary (1099) employee. (GE 2; \nTr. 37-39.) He largely spent his time watching his sister\u2019s children, and traveling, including \nto U.S. national parks. From February 2013 to August 2013, Applicant was employed by a \ntwo-person architectural firm with a small budget. After his projects were completed, he \nwas unemployed from September 2013 to October 2015, except for a brief period from \nJune to July 2015 when he was terminated for failing to meet the company\u2019s expectations \n(GE 2), and during this period, he also worked as a 1099 Uber driver. (Tr. 41.) Otherwise, \nduring his lengthy unemployment, he took some classes at a community college to sharpen \nhis AutoCAD drafting and information technology skills. His student loans were deferred. \n(Tr. 41.) From November 2015 to May 2016, Applicant had full-time work as a CAD drafter \ncontracted by a temporary employment agency to work on electrical diagrams for a utility \ncompany. He then worked through a job placement agency at $25 an hour for a small \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \ncompany in the building industry from June 2016 to August 2017, when he was laid off. \n(GE 1; Tr. 43.) \nApplicant completed an SF 86 on September 27, 2017, for his current employer. He \ndisclosed a trip to Europe to visit friends in June 2013. He responded negatively to all of \nthe financial record inquiries, including the following: \nIn the last seven (7) years have you failed to file or pay Federal, state, or \nother taxes when required by law or ordinance?; \nOther than previously listed, have any of the following happened to you? \nIn the last seven (7) years, you had a lien placed against your property or \nfailing to pay taxes or other debts. (Include financial obligations for which you \nwere the sole debtor, as well as those for which you were a cosigner or \nguarantor); \nYou are currently delinquent on any Federal debt. (Include financial \nobligations for which you are the sole debtor, as well as those for which you \nare a cosigner or guarantor). (GE 1.) \nApplicant desperately wanted a full-time job with a good company so he could turn \nhis life around. He found himself unable to compete with newer graduates in architecture, \nwho had updated computer skills that he did not possess, and he wanted to buy another \nhome. Having read and understood the penalties for making a false statement on the SF \n86, he now admits that he deliberately falsified his responses to the federal tax and debt \nquestions. He was filled with anxiety and desperate to get a job. He feared he would lose \nthe job opportunity if he answered correctly. (Tr. 49-51, 64.) His financial situation at that \ntime was not good. He was about to default on his student loans and owed the IRS a \nsubstantial sum. He had utility debts he could not pay. (Tr. 52.) He now regrets his lack of \ncandor and asserts that it will not happen again. (Tr. 64.) \nApplicant denied any current delinquencies when he completed his SF 86. (GE 1.) \nHowever, as of October 6, 2017, Applicant\u2019s credit report showed that he had filed a \nChapter 7 bankruptcy petition in October 2008, and he was granted a bankruptcy \ndischarge in January 2009 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). A December 2009 federal tax lien for $28,350 had \nnot been released (SOR \u00b6 1.i). Two federal student loans opened in January 2014 and \nMarch 2014 were in collection for $2,957 (SOR \u00b6 1.g) and $10,459 (SOR \u00b6 1.h), \nrespectively. A credit-card account, opened in March 2010, was in collection for $465 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.e) due to inactivity since June 2015. Two educational loans (one subsidized and one \nunsubsidized) opened in June 2004 were in deferment with a consolidated $94,699 \nbalance (SOR \u00b6 1.f). (GE 4.) \nDuring a January 29, 2018 interview by an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) \ninvestigator, Applicant was asked whether he had any accounts in collection status. He \nadmitted that he defaulted on his student loans, and a few other accounts, but he could \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nprovide no details. When confronted with the adverse information on his credit record, \nApplicant stated that the tax lien was for owing taxes from 2002 to 2009. He then related \nthat he had not filed tax returns for tax  years 2015 and 2016, because he mistakenly had \nbelieved that he had filed for an extension of the filing deadline and when he realized he \nhad not done so, it was \u201ctoo late\u201d to file. He admitted that he feared he might owe taxes \nthat he could not pay. Applicant claimed that he did not think his failure to disclose his tax \nissues on his SF 86 would be critical to his background investigation.  He stated that he \nwas working with an accountant and that his tax returns for tax years 2002 through 2009 \nshould be filed, but he did not know for certain. (GE 2.) He presently recalls having hired \nthe accountant in 2018. (Tr. 53.) Applicant admitted when asked by the investigator that he \nhad filed for bankruptcy in 2008 because he wanted to eliminate his debts, which he \nclaimed consisted of about $25,000 in credit-card debt and a $240,000 mortgage loan in \nforeclosure. Applicant explained that he was currently attempting to repair his financial \nissues and that he planned on filing his tax returns for 2017 and making an offer-in- \ncompromise with the IRS. Applicant expressed his belief that he was not at fault for his \nfinancial issues. He was unable to find a stable job due to \u201cbad luck and the economy.\u201d \nApplicant acknowledged that he had previously made no effort to address his bad debts \nbut he was now motivated by his background investigation to begin repaying his debts. (GE \n2.) \nApplicant was re-interviewed by the OPM investigator on February 9, 2018, for \ninformation about his accounts in collections, his bankruptcy, and his tax issues. Applicant \nfailed to provide information about many of the accounts. Information provided about his \nbankruptcy shows that he filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in October 2008 listing \n$243,087 in secured debt; $121,882 in unsecured priority debts, consisting of student \nloans, a state income tax liability of $1,669 from 2007, and $1,862 in property taxes); and \n$58,054 in unsecured nonpriority debts. He was granted a discharge in January 2009. In \nhis bankruptcy filing, Applicant reported no current income, but $28,220 in gross self-\nemployment income in 2008, and $4,095 in monthly expenses. Applicant gave the OPM \ninvestigator letters showing he had rehabilitated two student loans with an aggregate \nbalance of $94,699 (SOR \u00b6 1.f), and, as of February 8, 2018, Applicant was working with \nhis accountant to file his income tax returns for tax years 2015 and 2016; he had filed \nthrough his accountant tax returns for \u201call other years;\u201d and he was planning to make \nrepayment arrangements through his accountant with the IRS to address past-due taxes \ntotaling $22,834 ($6,600 for 2007, $8,932 for 2008, $6,655 for 2013, and $584 for 2014) as \nof October 2017. (GE 2.) Applicant now asserts that his federal income tax liability for 2008 \nhas been written off due to the statute of limitations. (AE E-1.) \nIn response to Interrogatories, Applicant indicated on January 5, 2019, that he had \nno record of whether he had filed his federal and state income tax returns for tax years \n2007 and 2008, although he suspected that he filed returns. He admitted that he had filed \nlate federal and state returns for tax years 2009 through 2017, and indicated that he owed \npast-due federal taxes, exclusive of penalties and interest, of $22 for 2009, $200 for 2011, \n$227 for 2012, $4,048 for 2013, $323 for 2014, $32 for 2015, $4,789 for 2016, and $3,000 \nfor 2017. He reported that he owed back state taxes of $819 for 2013, $102 for 2016, and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n$39 for 2017, but did not specify which state was owed the taxes. He gave the following \nexplanation for filing late and not paying his taxes: \nThe reason for filing late and not paying is entirely my fault. For most of \nthose years I was paid on a 1099 status. I had little tax withheld from my W-\n2, which resulted in me owing taxes year after year. This was not intentional \nbut due to the fact that I was not making enough money to pay all my living \nexpenses and pay all my taxes. I put my head in the sand and avoided this \nissue for way to [sic] many years. I am now on a W-2 income status with \n[employer name] and will be paying all my taxes. . . . (GE 2.) \nAt his hearing, Applicant testified that he did not file timely tax returns for a couple of \nreasons. He thought that because he could not pay taxes owed, he could not file his \nreturns, and he was \u201cafraid to file taxes.\u201d He acknowledged that it was \u201ca mistake\u201d to not \nfile his tax returns when they were due. (Tr. 43.) \nOn April 16, 2020, Applicant\u2019s accountant reported that, with his assistance, \nApplicant\u2019s tax returns for tax years 2007 through 2017 were filed late; Applicant\u2019s tax \nreturns for tax year 2018 were filed; and his $1,661 federal tax refund for 2018 was applied \nto his federal tax balance to bring his federal tax liability to about $20,000. (AE A.) \nAccording to Applicant\u2019s federal and state income tax returns, his tax returns for tax year \n2015 through 2017 were completed in mid-November 2018. On federal adjusted gross \nincome of $9,593 for 2015, he overpaid his federal taxes by $32 and his state income \ntaxes by $179 to state X, where he had earned income but does not reside. On federal \nadjusted gross income of $36,755 for 2016, he underpaid his federal income taxes by \n$4,789, but he expected a state refund of $97 from state X for 2016. On federal adjusted \ngross income of $36,706 for 2017, he underpaid his federal income taxes by $3,000. He \nexpected a refund of $55 from his state of residency (state Y) and $153 from state X. (AE \nB.) \nAn IRS account transcript for tax year 2018 shows that Applicant\u2019s tax return was \nreceived on June 19, 2019. His income tax refund of $1,661 on wage income of $56,467 \nwas intercepted by the IRS. He underpaid state income taxes by $989 for tax year 2018 to \nstate Z, the state where he is currently employed. (AE B.) According to his 2019 state \nincome tax return, he paid those taxes with his 2018 return. (AE C.) He expected a tax \nrefund of $679 from state Y. (AE B.) His federal and state income tax returns for tax year \n2019 were completed on October 8, 2020. (AE C.) \n6 \n \nWith his accountant\u2019s help, Applicant advanced $2,500 to the IRS on November 7, \n2019, as a first step in obtaining an offer-in-compromise. (AEs A, AE E-1, E-7.) He made \none $300 payment on November 29, 2019, under an installment agreement covering the \ntaxes owed for tax years 2008 and 2013, 2014, 2016, and 2017 totaling $27,684, but then \nmade no further payments on that agreement.

(Tr. 72-73.)  \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nThe SOR allegations are amply established by the evidence of record. After \nobtaining a financial fresh start through a January 2009 Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge of \nhis nonpriority unsecured debts (SOR \u00b6 1.a), Applicant defaulted on his student loans \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f-1.h), which are priority debts, a credit-card account (SOR \u00b6 1.e), two wireless-\nphone debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j-1.k), and a utility debt (SOR \u00b6 1.l). Additionally, Applicant did not \nfile his federal and state income tax returns when they were due for tax years 2007 through \n2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). A federal tax lien for $28,350 was filed against him in December 2009 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.i). There is no evidence that lien has been released, but it is also not clear \nwhether Applicant has any outstanding legal liability for any tax delinquencies for the tax \nyears covered by the lien. The ten-year federal tax statute of limitations has some tolling \nprovisions, although Applicant did not present any documentation showing evidence of its \napplication to the tax debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i. As of September 2020, Applicant owed $26,330 for \ntax years 2008 and 2013 through 2017. As of April 7, 2021, the IRS reported an \noutstanding tax liability of $17,210 for tax years 2013 through 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.c).

Guideline F security concerns \nare established when an individual fails to comply with his tax filing obligations, whether or \nnot any taxes are owed. The following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(g) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has the burden of establishing sufficient mitigation to overcome the \nfinancial concerns raised by his record of substantial delinquency and his noncompliance \nwith such an important obligation of his U.S. citizenship as filing income-tax returns on time \nfor about a decade. One or more of the following conditions under AG \u00b6 20 may apply in \nwhole or in part: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) has limited applicability in this case. Applicant\u2019s bankruptcy filing and \ndischarge happened \u201cso long ago\u201d and is not a circumstance that is likely to recur. \nHowever, his consumer credit defaults, including of his student loans, and his tax issues \nare too recent, and in the case of his tax issues also too recidivist, to be mitigated by AG \u00b6 \n20(a). \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply to Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file income tax returns. \nApplicant was obligated to file returns independent of whether he owed taxes that he could \nnot pay. AG \u00b6 20(b) is established to the extent that the economic downturn of 2008 and \nhis subsequently difficulty in finding stable, long-term employment were significant factors \nin him defaulting on his financial obligations. After he was laid off in August 2008, Applicant \nhad only temporary jobs that lasted a few weeks to a few months. He was not eligible for \nunemployment compensation because he had been a temporary (1099) employee. From \nFebruary 2013 to August 2013, Applicant was employed by a two-person architectural firm \nwith a small budget. After his projects were completed, he was unemployed from \nSeptember 2013 to October 2015, except for a brief period from June to July 2015 when \nhe was terminated for failing to meet the company\u2019s expectations, and when he worked as \na 1099 Uber driver. \nEven when the financial distress is caused or contributed to by circumstances \nbeyond one\u2019s control, the administrative judge has to consider whether the applicant has \nacted responsibly to address his debts and tax issues. Applicant had full-time work from \nNovember 2015 to August 2017 through a temporary employment agency. He was without \nincome from August 2017 to December 2017, when he began working for his current \nemployer. He began resolving his tax-filing issues in 2018, but in other aspects, he failed to \nshow sound financial judgment once he had stable employment. He managed to \nrehabilitate the student loan in SOR \u00b6 1.f by his OPM interview in February 2018 only to fall \nbehind some $2,055 on that loan by May 2019. His federal student loans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g \nand 1.h were in collection status. His wages were garnished for almost $8,000 before he \ncould consolidate his student loans in November 2019. In February 2020, he entered into \nan agreement with state X to repay his state tax delinquency but then failed to make the \npayments. He opened new credit accounts as his tax issues remained unresolved, such as \nthe line-of-credit in March 2020. That account was 90 days past due when he paid it off in \nOctober 2020 with funds withdrawn from his 401(k) account. \n12 \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), 20(d), and 20(g) are established with respect to rectifying his tax-filing \nissues. Applicant\u2019s accountant attests that, with his assistance, Applicant has filed his \ndelinquent income tax returns for tax years 2007 through 2017. It is unclear when the tax \nreturns for tax years 2007 through 2014 were prepared and filed. His income tax returns for \ntax years 2015 through 2017 were belatedly filed in November 2018. Applicant\u2019s tax \nreturns for 2018 were filed in June 2019, and his returns for tax year 2019 were filed in \nOctober 2020, within the extended deadline. Even where tax problems have been \ncorrected and an applicant is motivated to prevent such problems in the future, the \nadministrative judge is not precluded from considering an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness in \nlight of longstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-\n01984 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 2015). The Appeal Board has long held that the failure to file tax \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreturns suggests a problem with complying with well-established government rules and \nsystems. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04437 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). That said, the \ntiming of corrective action is an appropriate factor to consider in applying AG \u00b6 20(g). See \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 17-\n01807 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, 2018)). Applicant is credited with taking prompt action to \naddress his tax filings once he began working for a defense contractor. While his decade-\nlong disregard of his tax-filing obligations is not condoned, it is not likely to be repeated. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are also partially established because Applicant had settled \nthe collection debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.j-1.k between December 2019 and February 2020, \nalbeit after the SOR was issued. The utility debt in SOR \u00b6 1.l was not resolved until May \n2021, but it is no longer a source of financial pressure for Applicant. His student loans are \nno longer considered in default. Yet, it took garnishment of his wages for him to be able to \nconsolidate his student loans. He lacks a track record of timely student-loan payments, \nwithout which there is little basis on which to conclude that he can be counted on to make \nhis present $445 monthly payment. The loan was apparently deferred until recently, but \none payment as of his May 2021 hearing is an insufficient guarantee that he will continue \nto make his payments according to the terms he described at his hearing. Neither AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(c) nor AG 20(d) fully mitigates the security concerns about his student-loan defaults. \nWith respect to his state tax debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d, Applicant made a lump-sum \npayment of $1,806 in late October 2020 to resolve the debt. While that debt is no longer of \nsecurity concern, it is troubling that he failed to make the $150 monthly payments that he \nestablished with the state in February 2020. His failure to comply with that repayment \narrangement raises concerns about whether Applicant can be counted on to make his \ninstallment payments to the IRS to resolve the approximately $17,210 owed in past-due \nfederal income taxes. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), 20(d), and 20(g) are not fully mitigating of his federal \nincome tax delinquency. AG \u00b6 20(e) applies only in that the evidence falls short of \ndemonstrating that Applicant is currently liable for federal income taxes of $28,350 from \nDecember 2009 (SOR \u00b6 1.i) beyond the federal income taxes covered by SOR \u00b6 1.c. \nApplicant has not shown that he can manage his finances responsibly, even with his \nmother\u2019s financial assistance. Over the last 18 to 24 months, Applicant borrowed some \n$10,600 from his 401(k) to pay some debts. He used the funds to pay bills but also to take \na trip to Europe to visit friends. He also withdrew $23,000 from his 401(k) that went partially \nto purchase furniture and model-train items. While he has a goal of no longer borrowing \nonce he turns 50, a promise to change his financial habits is not a substitute for financially \nresponsible behavior. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe security concerns about personal conduct are articulated in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or \nadjudicative processes. \nApplicant responded negatively to all of the financial record inquiries on his \nSeptember 2017 SF 86, including questions concerning whether, in the last seven years, \nhe had failed to file returns or pay federal, state, or other taxes when required by law; \nwhether he had a lien filed against him in the last seven years; and whether he was \ncurrently delinquent on any federal debt. The undisputed evidence shows that he had not \ntimely filed federal or state income tax returns during the seven years preceding his SF 86; \nthat he owed past-due taxes to the IRS; and that the IRS had issued a tax lien for $28,350 \nagainst him in December 2009. While the tax lien was outside the seven-year scope of the \nSF 86 inquiry, Applicant knew that he owed past-due income taxes and that he had not \nfiled his tax returns for the seven years preceding his SF 86. Applicant admits that, after \nreading the admonishments for making a false statement, he knowingly lied about his tax \nsituation. While he may have been experiencing some anxiety about his employment \nsituation, he knew that he made a false statement. He was desperate to land his job with a \ndefense contractor. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so \ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or \nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 17(a) and AG \u00b6 17(e) have some applicability because the DOD through its \ninvestigation became aware that Applicant had not timely filed his income tax returns and \nowed past-due income taxes. However, AG \u00b6 17(a) does not fully apply because, even \nthough Applicant admitted that he had not filed his income tax returns for tax years 2015 \nand 2016 when he was interviewed by the OPM investigator, he did not volunteer the \ninformation before the investigator asked him about his financial issues. His admission to \nthe tax problems was in response to being confronted about the December 2009 tax lien. \nFurthermore, when asked about the omission of his tax matters from his SF 86, Applicant \nwas not fully candid with the investigator. He reportedly claimed that he forgot that he did \nnot file tax returns for tax year 2012, and he did not think his failure to report the non-filing \nfor tax years 2015 and 2016 would be critical to his investigation. While he now \nacknowledges that he acted out of desperation, he exhibits some minimization of \nresponsibility to the extent that he claims he thought the omission was not critical to \nsecurity concerns. None of the mitigating conditions fully apply in mitigation of his \ndeliberate falsification. \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Those factors are: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nThe analyses under Guidelines F and E are incorporated in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but \nsome warrant additional comment. \nThe security clearance adjudication involves an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in light of the security guidelines in the Directive. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). Applicant has dealt with some \nadverse employment circumstances not within his control. However, he exhibits little insight \ninto the good judgment that must be demanded of persons who are granted security \nclearance eligibility. It is not enough evidence of reform to borrow money to pay off debts \nso that he can make a \u201cgood impression on the DOD.\u201d Spending $3,000 for a trip to \nEurope to see friends may not seem extravagant to Applicant, but it is difficult to justify \nwhen he had to borrow for the trip, and owed past-due federal income taxes in excess of \n$17,000. His attitude that he works all the time and just wanted to take a vacation creates \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nlingering doubt as to whether he can be counted on to fulfill the obligations of security \nclearance eligibility when it may be personally inconvenient or disadvantageous. \nThe Appeal Board has repeatedly held that the government need not wait until an \napplicant mishandles or fails to safeguard classified information before denying or revoking \nsecurity clearance eligibility. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-09918 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) \n(citing Adams v. Laird, 420 F.2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969)). It is well settled that once \na concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong \npresumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, \n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). For the reasons discussed, I conclude it is not clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue security clearance \neligibility for Applicant. \nFormal Findings \nFormal finding for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a:-1.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.e: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.h: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i-1.l: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

Schachter, Esq. \n12/02/2020 \nDecision \nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to revoke his eligibility for \naccess to classified information. He did not present sufficient evidence to mitigate his \ncocaine use in 2017, when he was a federal employee holding a top-secret security \nclearance. Accordingly, this case is decided against Applicant. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant completed and submitted a Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF 86 format), the official form used for personnel security investigations, on \nAugust 6, 2017. (Exhibit 1) This document is commonly known as a security clearance \napplication. Thereafter, on February 28, 2020, after reviewing the application and the \ninformation gathered during a background investigation, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a statement \nof reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. The SOR is \nsimilar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the action under the security \nguidelines known as Guideline H for drug involvement and substance misuse and \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nGuideline E for personal conduct. The sole allegation under Guideline E is simply a \ncross-allegation to two of the three matters alleged under Guideline H. \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 19, 2020. His answer was extensive, \nconsisting of a lengthy memorandum and supporting documents marked as Exh\n \nibits A \u2013 \nF. For the Guideline H allegations: (1) he admitted using cocaine twice, but denied \nusing cocaine with \u201cvarying frequency\u201d between March and April 2017; (2) he admitted \nfailing a drug test because he tested positive for cocaine on or about April 12, 2017; and \n(3) he admitted using cocaine twice while holding a security clearance. For the \nGuideline E allegation, which cross-alleged the matters in (1) and (3) above, he denied \nthat the allegation relates to any conduct of current security significance because it is \nwholly derivation of the SOR allegations under Guideline H. He also requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge.   \nThe case was assigned to me on September 15, 2020. The case was heard as \nscheduled on October 27, 2020. Both Department Counsel and Applicant offered \ndocumentary exhibits. Government Exhibits 1, 3, and 4 were admitted. Exhibit 2 was not \nadmitted per Applicant\u2019s objection. Applicant relied on Exhibits A - F included in his \nAnswer and also presented Exhibit G, all of which were admitted without objection. No \nwitnesses were called other than Applicant.

The job required \nextended travel, both domestically and overseas. He was so employed until October \n2019 when he began his current employment. \nApplicant used cocaine in about March 2017 and April 2017, when he was a 39-\nyear-old federal employee holding a top-secret security clearance with SCI access. He \ndid so on both occasions at a nightclub where he was offered cocaine by an \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nacquaintance (\u201ca friend of a friend\u201d). (Tr. 21, 29) He accepted the cocaine on both \noccasions. It was powder cocaine. He used it by snorting it. Subsequently, he was \nselected for a random drug test by his federal employer on April 12, 2017, and he tested \npositive for cocaine. (Exhibits 3 and 4) He was contacted by the medical review officer \nand informed of the positive test result on April 26, 2017. He then contacted his \nsupervisor and reported that the medical review officer had notified him of the positive \ndrug test. He \u201cinsisted\u201d to his supervisor that the drug test was wrong. (Exhibit 4) He \nwas less than candid with his supervisor about the positive drug test due to his shame \nand embarrassment. He later admitted to his supervisor that the positive drug test was \ncorrect and that he had used cocaine. He resigned from federal employment in early \nMay 2017. His resignation occurred before his employer initiated any form of \ndisciplinary action. \nApplicant described his use of cocaine as \u201cthe biggest mistake of my life.\u201d \n(Exhibit 1 at 35) He attributed his cocaine use to the underlying issue of sleep apnea, \nwhich is long-standing and often left him \u201ctired and miserable.\u201d (Exhibits E and F; Tr. 21-\n22) His chronic fatigue was such that he found it difficult to wake up in the morning and \nwas sometimes late for work, leading him to be counseled for occasional lateness by his \nsupervisor during his federal employment. He explained that he used the cocaine \nbecause \u201che just wanted to enjoy a life of energy like everyone else.\u201d (Answer at 5) After \nyears of seeing doctors, he was recommended for corrective surgery to address the \nproblem in May 2017. (Exhibit 1 at 36) He had the surgery during the summer of 2019, \nand he reports that he is now able to better tolerate the CPAP machine and his sleep \nhas improved. His history of sleep apnea, the sleep disruption it caused, and the post-\nsurgery improvement of his sleep was confirmed and verified by his spouse, who is well \naware of the matter. (Exhibit D)  \nApplicant stated that he has not used cocaine since 2017, and there is no record \nevidence to establish cocaine usage other than the two occasions in 2017. He no longer \nassociates with the group of people he was with when he used cocaine in 2017. (Tr. 37-\n39) He submitted a signed statement of intent setting forth his intention to abstain from \nall drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement \nor misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. (Exhibit C)  \nIn addition to the signed statement of intent, Applicant submitted a number of \ndocuments in support of his case. (Exhibits A - G) Taken together, the documentation \nshows that he has enjoyed a good record of employment over the years. The \ndocuments also include highly favorable recommendations from several people. Those \nmatters are summarized below. \nApplicant\u2019s former supervisor during his federal employment provided an affidavit \nwherein he stated the following: (1) Applicant had a solid work ethic and always \nreceived positive annual performance reviews resulting in further recognition and \nbonuses; (2) the former supervisor is well aware of the facts and circumstances in the \nSOR, and he believes Applicant\u2019s use of cocaine was out of character and will not recur; \nand (3) he believes Applicant can be trusted with access to classified information. \n(Exhibit A1) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s former chief information officer provided an affidavit wherein he \nstated the following: (1) Applicant was a careful, considerate, efficient, and dedicated \nemployee who completed all assignments ahead of schedule; (2) the CIO is aware of \nthe facts and circumstances in the SOR, and he believes Applicant\u2019s use of cocaine \nwas an unfortunate situation and probably one of a kind; and (3) he believes Applicant \ncan be trusted with access to classified information. (Exhibit A2) \nApplicant\u2019s longtime friend and fellow IT professional provided an affidavit \nwherein he stated the following: (1) he has known Applicant for more than 20 years as \nthey met through mutual friends in their hometown and they communicate almost daily \nvia text message and social media; (2) he is aware of the facts and circumstances in the \nSOR, and he believes Applicant\u2019s cocaine use was \u201can extraordinary anomaly and not \nreflective of his character\u201d; (3) Applicant confided in him after resigning from federal \nemployment and was both very regretful and disappointed in himself; and (4) he \nbelieves Applicant should be granted a security clearance. (Exhibit A3) \nApplicant\u2019s current company president provided an affidavit wherein he stated \nthe following: (1) Applicant has proved himself to be a trusted and reliable employee \nduring his relatively short tenure with the company, which resulted in his assignment as \nacting vice-president of a sister company; (2) he is aware of the facts and \ncircumstances in the SOR, and he believes those matters do not reflect Applicant\u2019s \ncharacter, current conduct, and willingness and ability to protest classified information, \nand that the cocaine usage was an aberration that will not recur; and (3) he believes \nApplicant can be trusted with access to classified information. (Exhibit G) \nLaw and Policies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \n1  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v.

The main points of the \nExecutive Order are: (1) federal employees are required to refrain from using illegal \ndrugs; (2) use of illegal drugs by federal employees, on or off duty, is contrary to the \nefficiency of the service; and (3) persons who use illegal drugs are not suitable for \nfederal employment. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance abuse; \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted). \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14. \n7 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n8 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; \nAG \u00b6 25(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified \ninformation or holding a sensitive position; \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds of revocation of national security eligibility. \nI have considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s involvement with cocaine. It consisted \nof the two admitted uses of cocaine in 2017. It was detected by a random drug test in \nApril 2017. His cocaine use occurred during his employment with a federal criminal \ninvestigative organization while he held a top-secret security clearance with SCI access. \nAny illegal drug use is relevant in the context of evaluating a person\u2019s security \nworthiness, but it is particularly egregious if it occurs during the course of federal \nemployment while granted access to classified information. More was expected of \nApplicant given his age (39), educational background, and maturity in 2017. He also \nshould have known better in light of his previous military service and his years of \nemployment while holding a security clearance. His cocaine use was an egregious \nlapse of good judgment. \nApplicant presented a good case in mitigation. It is apparent that he understands \nthe seriousness of his misconduct. He is both remorseful and regretful. He has \ndisassociated himself from drug-using associates and contacts. He is career focused, \nhas a good record of employment (including honorable military service), and has highly \nfavorable recommendations from co-workers and friends. His cocaine use occurred \nmore than three years ago, there is no evidence of further illegal drug use, and he has \npledged to abstain from all illegal drug involvement and substance misuse. I have also \nconsidered the underlying issue of Applicant\u2019s long-standing medical condition of sleep \napnea. It played a role in his decision to use cocaine. And it is noteworthy that his sleep \napnea is now much improved due to the medical treatment he had in 2019. \nNonetheless, I am not persuaded that Applicant is an acceptable security risk \nwithin the meaning of \u00b6 2(a) of Appendix A of Enclosure 2 to the Directive. I reached \nthis conclusion for a couple of reasons. First, his 2017 cocaine use was clearly \nforbidden conduct that he chose to engage in despite knowing the potential negative \nconsequences. In addition to being a serious lapse in good judgment, his cocaine use \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. In particular, I \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s honorable military service and his sleep apnea. I conclude that \nhe has not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndemonstrated a willingness to engage in high-risk behavior, which does not make him a \ngood candidate for a security clearance. Second, I doubt Applicant\u2019s cocaine use would \nhave come to light but for the random drug test. Indeed, he did not report his cocaine \nuse to his federal employer before the random drug test. Third, when confronted with a \npositive result from the drug test, Applicant insisted to his then supervisor that the test \nresult was wrong. Taken together, the seriousness of his misconduct, his reluctance to \nvoluntarily self-report his cocaine use, and his initial lack of candor undermine his \nsecurity suitability. Finally, I note that the ultimate outcome here is consistent with \nsimilar cases that I have decided involving illegal drug use while holding a security \nclearance. E.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02225 (May, 10, 2019), which was affirmed by the \nDOHA Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 17-02225 (App. Bd. Jun. 25, 2019). \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAgainst Applicant  \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAgainst Applicant  \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant9 \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information. Eligibility is denied. \nMichael H. Leonard \nAdministrative Judge \n9 The SOR cross-allegation under Guideline E for personal conduct concerns Applicant\u2019s questionable \njudgment in light of his cocaine use. After considering the applicable disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions under Guideline E, the matter is decided against Applicant under the rationale discussed \nabove under Guideline H. Further discussion under Guideline E is redundant. \n7 \n",

The SOR also alleges that she was terminated \nfor cause from her employment as a security officer in April 2017, after allowing the above-\nmentioned unauthorized individual use of a secure computer terminal (SOR \u00b6 2.a). The \nSOR also alleges that she was terminated from employment in August 2017, as a security \nofficer with another employer, for improper conduct (SOR \u00b6 2.b). \nApplicant first became a security officer in approximately 2015, at age 21. She \nworked as a \u201cfloater\u201d and was assigned to various sites as needed. In April 2017, at age \n23, she worked at a site for which she had just been assigned two months prior. She had \njust completed training. While assisting an employee, another individual approached the \nsecurity bypass door and informed Applicant that she needed a replacement badge. \nApplicant obtained the individual\u2019s identification card and verified on the computer system \nthat the individual was an employee. Applicant then obtained approval, from another \nexperienced security officer on duty, to escort the individual through the security bypass \ndoor and to the security desk so that Applicant could issue the individual a badge. When \nApplicant tried to further verify the individual\u2019s credentials on the computer system, \nApplicant repeatedly mistyped the individual\u2019s name. When the individual offered to help, \nApplicant placed the keyboard on the upper level of the security desk to allow the \nindividual to type in her own information.

Applicant told her to stop, at which point the individual \nreturned to the front of the security desk. Applicant then proceeded with issuing the \nindividual her badge. (Tr. at 24-44, 51-64, 66-77; GE 1-3; AE A) \nWhen Applicant reported to work the following day, two on-duty security officers \ntold her that she no longer worked there. She did not receive a response when she texted \nher supervisor to ask what was going on. After several days, she reported to the office as \ninstructed and was informed that she was terminated. Employment records reflect that \nshe was discharged for allowing an authorized individual use of a secure computer. She \ndenied responding, \u201cNo big deal.\u201d She testified that she believed she did primarily as she \nwas trained, but acknowledged her poor judgment in permitting the unauthorized \nindividual to use her computer keyboard. (Tr. at 24-44, 51-64, 66-77; GE 1-3; AE A) \nApplicant acknowledged that she had previous unfavorable incidents with the \nsame employer. In February 2016, she was given a written warning for violating her \nemployer\u2019s phone policy when she pulled out her phone while on duty. In April 2016, she \nwas given a written warning for tardiness. In June 2016, she was given a final warning for \nabandoning her post after she could not find the device she needed to patrol the site. She \ntestified that she did so only after she unsuccessfully attempted to contact her supervisor \nmultiple times and consequently believed that her employer no longer had authority over \nthe site. In July 2016, she was verbally reprimanded for poor attendance. In January 2017, \nshe was verbally reprimanded for violating her employer\u2019s uniform policy when she was \nnot in proper uniform while on duty. She testified that she understood the importance of \nfollowing her employer\u2019s rules and regulations, even if she found them to be strict. (Tr. at \n17, 27-29, 31, 44-64, 66-77; GE 1-3) \nAfter working for another DOD contractor for approximately two months, Applicant \nwas terminated from employment as a security officer in August 2017, due to improper \nconduct. She testified that she reported to work approximately 30 minutes late because \nshe had to change her car\u2019s flat tire in the rain. She called her manager and her on-site \nco-worker to report her tardiness. She was drenched upon arriving at work so she wrung \nout her uniform and took off her shoes and socks in an effort to get dry. Her actions were \ncaptured on camera and her supervisor notified her the following day that she was \ndismissed due to a consequent client complaint. She testified that she understood that \nshe should have handled her discomfort privately. She has not since had any other \nunfavorable incidents with other employers and testified that she has matured and \nlearned from her mistakes. (Tr. at 28-31, 64-77; GE 1-2) \nApplicant\u2019s character references, to include her current employer, a former \ncolleague, and two friends, describe her as a responsible and trustworthy individual.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information \nThe security concern for handling protected information is set out in AG \u00b6 33: \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information-which includes classified and other sensitive \ngovernment information, and proprietary information-raises doubt about an \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability \nto safeguard such information, and is a serious security concern. \nThe guideline notes the conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 \n34. I have considered all of the disqualifying conditions under \u00b6 AG 34 and considered \nthe following relevant:  \n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or sensitive \ninformation; and \n(h) negligence or lax security practices that persist despite counseling by \nmanagement. \nApplicant failed to exercise good judgment and demonstrated negligent and lax \nsecurity practices as a security officer from 2016 to 2017. She received multiple verbal \nand written warnings for violating her employer\u2019s phone, uniform, and attendance policies, \nand for abandoning her post. One employer discharged her after she allowed an \nunauthorized individual use of her secure computer, and another did so after she violated \nthat employer\u2019s uniform policy. AG \u00b6\u00b6 34(g) and 34(h) are established. \nConditions that could mitigate the security concerns involving handling protected \ninformation are provided under AG \u00b6 35. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions \nunder \u00b6 AG 35 and considered the following relevant: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant was young and a new security officer in 2016 and 2017. She accepted \nresponsibility for her failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or sensitive \ninformation and her negligent and lax security practices. She has learned from them. She \nhas not since had any other unfavorable incidents with subsequent employers. I find that \nAG \u00b6 35(a) is established. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe personal conduct security concern is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16 and \nconsidered the following relevant: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other \nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but \nwhich, when combined with all available information, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of \ncandor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics \nindicating that the individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. This includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized release of \nsensitive corporate or government protected information; and \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \nFor the same reasons as set forth above under my Guideline K analysis, AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n16(d)(1) and 16(d)(3) are established. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 and considered \nthe following relevant: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nAlso for the same reasons as set forth above, I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(d) are \nestablished. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines K and E in my \nwhole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns involving handling protected information and \npersonal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline K: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nCandace Le\u2019i Garcia \nAdministrative Judge \n \n7 \n",

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and  \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nApplicant\u2019s brothers, parents-in-law, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, aunts, and \nuncles are citizens and residents of Iraq. The potential for terrorist violence against U.S. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninterests and citizens remains high in Iraq, and it continues to have human rights \nproblems. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a potential conflict of interest and a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and \ncoercion. The above disqualifying conditions have been raised by the evidence. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following is potentially applicable: \n there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \n \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Iraq. The nature of a nation\u2019s \ngovernment, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record are \nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated \nwith or dependent upon the government, the country is known to conduct intelligence \noperations against the United States, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of \nterrorism.  \n \n \nApplicant is a loyal U.S. citizen who has worked overseas under dangerous \nconditions in support of the national defense. He credibly testified that his family in Iraq \ncould not be used to coerce or intimidate him into revealing classified information. The \nAppeal Board has stated that such a statement, standing alone, is of limited value, \nunless there is record evidence that the applicant has acted in a similar manner in the \npast in comparable circumstances, or that the applicant has a previous track record of \ncomplying with security regulations and procedures in the context of dangerous, high-\nrisk circumstances in which he made a significant contribution to the national security. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case 07-06030 at 3-4 (App. Bd. June 19, 2008). In ISCR Case No. 05-\n03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2006), the Appeal Board discussed this issue as follows: \n \nAs a general rule, Judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s prior \nhistory of complying with security procedures and regulations significant \nprobative value for the purposes of refuting, mitigating, or extenuating the \nsecurity concerns raised by that applicant\u2019s more immediate disqualifying \nconduct or circumstances. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-03357 at 4 (App. \nBd. Dec. 13, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-10113 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, \n2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 30, 2006). \nHowever, the Board has recognized an exception to that general rule in \nGuideline B cases, where the applicant has established by credible, \nindependent evidence that his compliance with security procedures and \nregulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk circumstances \nin which the applicant had made a significant contribution to the national \n \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \nsecurity. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. July 14, \n2006). The presence of such circumstances can give credibility to an \napplicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to recognize, resist, and \nreport a foreign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or exploitation.  \nApplicant worked under dangerous conditions as a linguist in support of the U.S. \nmission from 2003 to 2004, and again from 2007 to 2009, which earned him a special \nimmigrant visa. His closest family, which includes his wife, children, and parents, are \nU.S. citizens and residents. I find that Applicant can be expected to resolve any \npotential conflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(b) is applicable.  \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant\u2019s work with the U.S. mission in Iraq earned him a special immigrant \nvisa. The Appeal Board has held that \u201can applicant\u2019s proven record of action in defense \nof the United States is very important and can lead to a favorable result for an applicant \nin a Guideline B case.\u201d ISCR Case 04-02511 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 20, 2007). The \ncomplicated state of affairs in Iraq places a significant burden of persuasion on \nApplicant to demonstrate that his family members in Iraq do not pose an unacceptable \nsecurity risk. He has met that burden. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the foreign influence security concerns.  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

He married his ex-wife in 1994, they separated in \napproximately 2014, and divorced in 2019. They have two adult children. He received a \nBachelor of Science degree in chemical engineering in 1993.

He has worked for defense \ncontractors since 1994, and has worked for his employer since 2006, where he is currently \na mechanical engineer. He also volunteers as an advisor at a local university for fourth-\nyear chemical engineering students. Applicant\u2019s first security clearance was granted in \n1993, it was renewed in 2002, and revoked in 2014 due to financial issues related to \ninvestments. (GE 1; GE 2; AE I; Tr. 12-14, 20, 83, 96) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file his state and federal income tax \nreturns and pay his state and federal income taxes in a timely manner for tax years 2011 \nthrough 2015, and 2017, as required. In 2016, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) filed a \ntax lien against him for $67,521. Additionally, he disclosed in his response to \ninterrogatories that he owed approximately $1,005 to State A and $12,467 to the IRS for \ntax year 2014. Finally, the SOR alleged Applicant has five delinquent consumer debts \ntotaling $49,369. Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. \nIn his November 2016 security clearance application (SCA), Applicant disclosed \nthat he failed to file his state and federal income tax returns for tax year 2014. He did not \ninclude that he failed to file tax returns for 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2015 as well, but he \nestimated that he owed approximately $30,000 in total tax debt. (GE 1) \nDuring his August 2018 personal subject interview, Applicant told the background \ninvestigator that he the failed to file his 2013 and 2014 federal and state income tax \nreturns in a timely manner, but planned to file both tax returns soon. At that time, he \nclaimed he had filed tax returns for 2015 and 2016. He also stated that he had filed an \nextension for tax year 2017, but intended to file his returns before the extension expired. \nAt the hearing, Applicant admitted that he had not yet filed his 2011 to 2015 state and \nfederal income tax returns, this is discussed in depth below. (GE 2 at 13; Tr. 81) \nAccording to Applicant, he suffered financial issues, and he did not file his state \nand federal income tax returns for tax years 2011 through 2015, and 2017 in a timely \nmanner, because: \n\uf0b7 Applicant was significantly injured in 2007 or 2008, while playing a basketball \ngame, which resulted in him being unable to work.

Additionally, \nalthough the failure to file his tax returns for tax year 2019 was not alleged in the SOR, \nhe also admitted that he had not filed his 2019 federal or state income tax return after the \nextension expired in October 2020. As noted in the chart below, Applicant claimed in his \npost-hearing submissions that he filed his 2011 through 2015 federal and state income \ntax returns on May 17, 2021.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information.

An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns.

However, his \nfailure to file his returns and potentially pay his taxes for tax years 2016, 2018, and 2019 \ndemonstrates that Applicant\u2019s tax issue has been an ongoing problem for almost ten \nyears, and this issue is not isolated, raising additional questions concerning the \napplicability of mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(a) regarding his judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. \nIn his SCA, PSI, response to interrogatories, hearing testimony, and \ndocumentation Applicant provided inconsistent information regarding when he filed his \nvarious income tax returns. He also failed to provide account transcripts from the IRS and \nState A as requested (but they would not be available this soon because of his late filings). \nWithout these documents, it is difficult to determine if the tax returns were accepted and \nthe IRS agreed that his tax returns were accurate. Moreover, he may owe additional \nmoney to the IRS or State A due to penalties and interest due to his failure to file his \nreturns in a timely manner. \nApplicant\u2019s efforts to resolve his taxes shortly after the hearing do not demonstrate \na good-faith effort. His various explanations for his failure to timely file the returns do not \nestablish conditions that were beyond his control, nor did he act responsibly to address \nhis financial issues in a timely manner. Mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), \nand 20(g) was not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. \nApplicant held a clearance for approximately 20 years. However, he failed to file \nhis state and federal income tax returns on time for nearly ten years. Additionally, his \nclearance was revoked in 2014 for financial issues and this did not affect his financial \nbehavior. Applicant did not demonstrate the actions of a responsible, reliable, and \ntrustworthy person. I conclude Applicant did not meet his burden of proof and persuasion. \nHe failed to mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest of the United \nStates to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCAROLINE E.

Price, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Frederick D. Greco, Esq. \n02/03/2021 \n Remand Decision \nWESLEY, ROGER C. Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nApplicant mitigated personal conduct concerns but did not mitigate financial concerns. \nEligibility for access to classified information or to hold a sensitive position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 2, 2019, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated Central \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nreasons why under the financial considerations guideline the DoD could not make the \npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and \nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was taken \nunder Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960); DoD Directive 5220.6 Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program, (January 2, 1992) (Directive); and Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR on February 25, 2020, and requested a hearing. \nThis case was assigned to me on June 26, 2020. A hearing was scheduled for August \n1 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                   Procedural Issues \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n17, 2020, and heard on the date as scheduled. At the hearing, the Government\u2019s case \nconsisted of eight exhibits (GEs 1-8) (Tr. 29-44). Applicant relied on 14 exhibits (A-N) \nand one witness (himself). The transcript (Tr.) was received on August 28, 2020. \n \nI issued a decision on October 16, 2020, denying Applicant\u2019s clearance. He \nappealed the decision, and on January 6, 2021, the Appeal Board remanded the case \nto me to correct the identified errors and issue a new decision in accordance with \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.35. These identified errors are addressed and incorporated in the \nfindings and conclusions that follow. \nBefore the opening of the hearing, Applicant made a motion in limine to exclude \nreferences to Applicant\u2019s March 2012 termination covered in the summary interview of \nApplicant by an agent of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). (GE 2) Applicant \nnever waived his right to have the OPM summary of interview excluded from evidentiary \nconsideration. For good cause shown, Applicant\u2019s motion was granted in part, and the \nreferenced paragraph covering his prior employment termination was stricken from the \nmarked GE 2 exhibit. (Tr. 33) Applicant accepted the balance of the OPM summary of \ninterview for full evidentiary consideration. I denied his included motion in limine to \nexclude his similar explanation of his 2012 employment termination in the electronic \nquestionnaires for electronic processing (e-QIP) he completed in July 2017. (GE 1) \nPrior to the close of the proceedings, Applicant asked to leave the record open to \nafford him the opportunity to supplement the record with information documenting the \nprincipal amount owing on his student loans. For good cause shown, Applicant was \ngranted 14 days to supplement the record. The Government was afforded three days to \nrespond. Within the time permitted, Applicant provided several pieces of documentation \ncovering the amounts still owing on the student loans referenced in the SOR: (a) a \npayment summary of Applicant\u2019s U.S.-guaranteed and since consolidated student loan \naccounts covering his daughter\u2019s education loans (AE P); (b) payment summaries of a \nnon-SOR student loan account of his daughter (AEs O and Q); and an email \nexplanation of the submitted student loan payment summaries by Applicant\u2019s counsel \n(AE R). Applicant\u2019s post-hearing submissions were admitted as AEs O-R without \nobjections for consideration. Respective comments of counsel for both parties on the \nexhibits will also be considered. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly accumulated three delinquent student \nloan debts with a combined amount exceeding $117,000 and two consumer debts with \na combined amount exceeding $630. Allegedly, Applicant\u2019s debts remain unsatisfied \nand unresolved. \nUnder an SOR amendment submitted by Department Counsel preceding the \nissuance of the hearing notice, raising Guideline E concerns, Applicant allegedly was \nterminated from his employment with a prior defense contractor in March 2012 after \n2 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbeing granted a security clearance. Allegedly, his termination was based on his being \ncaught taking a picture of a sensitive Army base site with a personal camera. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant denied all of the Guideline F allegations \ncovering his debts with explanations. Without disputing the underlying student loan \ndelinquencies alleged, he claimed he has been paying on his student loan accounts, \nwhich represent parent loans for his daughter in the amount of $302.54 monthly. He \nfurther claimed that since 2014 the monthly payments have been involuntarily deducted \nfrom his earned Social Security (SS) benefits and tax refunds. Addressing his alleged \nconsumer debts, Applicant claimed he could not identify either reported debt and \nclaimed the credit report listing these debts was inaccurate. \nIn his response to the personal conduct allegations covered in the Government\u2019s \nGuideline E amendment, Applicant denied the allegations in full. He interposed no \nobjection to the amendment and provided no explanations for his denial pertaining to his \nalleged termination by his employer for cause \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 73-year-old call center operator for a defense contractor who seeks \na security clearance. Applicant denied generally each of the allegations in the SOR with \nexplanations covering the financial allegations that included admissions. Findings of fact \nfollow. \nBackground \nApplicant married in November 1968 and divorced in December 1982. (GE 1) He \nhas one adult child from this marriage. He remarried in January 1983 and was widowed \nin November 2013. He has one adult child from this marriage. Applicant earned \ncommunity college education credits between September 1971 and June 1973, but did \nnot receive a degree or diploma. (GE 1) He enlisted in the U.S. Army in October 1966 \nand served two years of active duty. Applicant earned a bronze star and purple heart in \nrecognition of his distinguished contributions to his military service. (AE A) \nSince August 2016, Applicant has been employed by his current employer. (GE \n1) He reported periods of unemployment between August 2015 and March 2016, \nbetween July 2013 and September 2013, and between February 2011 and March 2011. \nIn March 2012, Applicant was terminated from his then employer as a switch operator \non an Army Base. Cited cause for his termination was his being caught taking pictures \nof a dial central office with a personal camera after being granted a security clearance in \nJune 2011. (GEs 1 and 6) \nApplicant\u2019s finances  \nBetween November 2008 and May 2019, Applicant accumulated three \ndelinquent student loan debts he guaranteed as a parent for his daughter\u2019s college \neducation. These loans covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b61.a-1.b and 1.d involve three separate \n3 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nstudent loan accounts, each guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Education (DoE): \none for $42,802; another for $35,313; and a third for $39,108. (GEs 2-5) Based on \navailable credit reports, the student loan covered by SOR \u00b6 1.d was opened jointly; \nwhile the loans covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b were opened individually by Applicant. (GE \n4) \nFor two years (2012-2013) after the loans became due, Applicant\u2019s wife made \nvoluntary payments on the loans on behalf of their working daughter. (Tr. 124) During \nsome of this time (for short periods in 2011 and again in 2013), Applicant reported \nperiods of unemployment, which may explain some of the reasons for his wife\u2019s paying \non their daughter\u2019s student loans before her passing. Still unclear is why he could not \nhelp her and his daughter with payments on the loans that he was individually \nresponsible for while he was gainfully employed. \nFollowing his wife\u2019s passing in November 2013, Applicant did not assume any \nresponsibility for making voluntary payments on his daughter\u2019s student loans, and in \nJanuary 2014, the accounts were reported to be delinquent. (GEs 2-5; Tr. 122-123)  \nAsked whether his daughter ever made any payments once she began working, \nApplicant could not say. (Tr. 124) Acknowledging that each of the three loans went into \ndefault after 2013, he could not confirm with any certainty whether any of the loans were \never placed in forbearance before or after the defaults. (Tr. 121-123) Credit reports do \nnot reflect any prior forbearances granted to Applicant on any or all of the three student \nloans covered in the SOR. (GEs 3-5) \n \nIn his hearing testimony, Applicant expressed certainty that his three parent-\nguaranteed student loans were consolidated into one loan. (Tr. 122) He provided no \ndocumentation of consolidation of any or all of the three loans, however, and only the \ntwo loans covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b61.a and 1.b  are treated by the DoE and the Department \nof the Treasury (DoT) as consolidated into one account for collection purposes. (GEs A-\nN and P) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWithout corroborated evidence of consolidation of the student loan covered by \nSOR \u00b61.d with the loans covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, the SOR 1.d DoE-guaranteed \nstudent loan must be considered a separate delinquent loan account that was \napparently not included in any DoT garnishment initiatives covering the SOR 1.a-1.b \nloans. (GEs 3-5 and AEs Q-R; Tr. 121-123) And, from the evidence produced, none of \nthe three delinquent student loans covered by the SOR have been voluntarily \naddressed by Applicant or his daughter since his deceased wife\u2019s passing in November \n2013. \nBeginning in January 2016, and ending in February 2020, the DoT placed the \nsince consolidated two parent-guaranteed loans (totaling $78,115) in collection status \nand began intercepting Applicant\u2019s SS benefits and involuntarily applied over $300 a \nmonth of Applicant\u2019s earmarked SS benefits to his delinquent student loan debts (AEs \nB-N and P-R; Tr. 54) The DoT\u2019s intercepted dollar amounts from Applicant\u2019s monthly \n$2,200 SS benefits ranged from $300 to $338 a month and were all applied to fees and \ninterest only. (AEs B-L and P-R; Tr. 53-54) Altogether, DoT intercepted monthly \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \namounts in excess of $9,000 from Applicant\u2019s SS benefits between January 2016 and \nFebruary 2020. (AEs B-L and P-R)  \n \nAfter February 2020, the DoT ceased intercepting portions of Applicant\u2019s SS \nbenefits, likely attributable to the Covid-19 pandemic. (Tr. 28) Absent any documented \nvoluntary payments on the student loan debts from Applicant (none reported), the DoT \ncan be expected to resume its intercepting of Applicant\u2019s SS benefits once the Covid-19 \npandemic fades or Applicant\u2019s consolidated student loans are otherwise favorably \nresolved. \nBecause the DoT\u2019s intercepted funds from Applicant\u2019s SS benefits were applied \nexclusively to interest and fees owing on the student loan debts, Applicant was not \ncredited with any principal reductions from the SS benefits intercepted by the DoT. (AEs \nN and P) Based on updated information (AEs P-R), the principal balance of $78,115 \nremains unchanged. (GEs 3-5 and AEs P-R)  \nAdditional delinquent debts attributable to Applicant in the SOR are two small \ndelinquent medical debts totaling $633. (GEs 2-5) These debts are listed in Applicant\u2019s \ncredit reports without any information by which to identify the creditors by name. Asked \nabout these debts, Applicant could not identify them as debts belonging to him. (GE 2; \nTr. 40-41) The listed medical debts are small and cannot be further corroborated. \nCurrently, Applicant has an annual salary of $40,000. (Tr. 52) He has earned \nannual social security benefits of $25,000 and two pensions from prior employers that \npay him $441 and $350 a month, respectively, for a combined annual return of $9,480. \n(Tr. 93-94) He maintains an average monthly checking balance of $1,600 and an \naverage monthly savings balance in the $600 range. (Tr. 94). His monthly debt liabilities \ninclude a $279,000 mortgage on a home valued at $420,000. (Tr. 95)  \nBased on Applicant\u2019s monthly income and identified debts, his current financial \ncondition should enable him to make some voluntary payments on his daughter\u2019s \ndelinquent student loans for which he bears repayment responsibility. Since 2013, \nthough, he has made no voluntary payments on the loans that are in any way \ndocumented. \nApplicant\u2019s 2012 employment separation \nAccording to Joint Personnel Adjudicative System (JPAS) incident reports from \nthe Army Base in which he was assigned in March 2012, Applicant was discovered by \nbase police taking pictures with his personal camera phone of a base-dial central office \ndirectly outside of the Base communications office at the Army Base where he was \nassigned. (GE 6) He acknowledged his awareness that having any camera on Base \nproperty is strictly forbidden. (Tr. 101, 130) \nIt is unclear from JPAS reports of the incident as to why Applicant took such a \npicture of a major portion of the Base\u2019s dial-central office.

(GE 1; Tr. 105-109,  114-119, and 126-128, 131-\n132) Based on Applicant\u2019s understanding of the sequence of events, the manager of       \nthe Base customer told him he was fired. (Tr. 107) Applicant\u2019s direct supervisor, in turn, \nconcurred with the customer manager\u2019s directives and formally fired Applicant.

(Tr. 109-110) \nTwo weeks after the reported Base camera incident, Applicant was fired for \ncause by his own supervisor. (GE 1; Tr. 107-109) It is Applicant\u2019s stated belief that his \nensuing firing was prompted by the contracting customer\u2019s perceived retaliation to \nApplicant\u2019s reporting his observations of the customer\u2019s heated encounter with his wife \n(armed with a gun in his possession), to his supervisor. (Tr. 107-109) Corroboration of \nApplicant\u2019s claimed observations is lacking in the record. \nWith conflicting versions of what Applicant was targeting with his camera in the \nMarch 2012 incident, little evidence in place to corroborate either version of the camera \nincident, and the lengthy time lapse (over eight years) in which to locate witnesses with \nclear recollections of the camera incident, inferences of what Applicant was targeting \nwith his personal camera in the reported March 2012 Base incident cannot be \nreasonably and reliably drawn without considerable reaching and speculation. All that is \nclear and accepted is that Applicant took a picture with his personal camera of some \nobject on the Base in March 2012 that he knew at the time was forbidden by Base \nregulations and guidelines, was escorted off the Base, and was later terminated by his \ndirect supervisor. \nSince his March 2012 Base camera incident, Applicant has not had any reported \nadverse incidents involving security violations. His employment record with his current \nemployer has no known adverse marks or blemishes. \nPolicies \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Department of the Navy v.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern:  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \n7 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                  Personal Conduct \n \n \n                                                    Burdens of Proof \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information.

An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds.  .  .  . AG \u00b6 18.  \nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure \nto cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national \nsecurity investigative or adjudicative processes.  .  .  .  AG \u00b6 15. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Additional security concerns are \nraised over his March 2012 termination attributable to his reported violating Base \nregulations and guidelines banning the taking of pictures of Base property by taking a \npicture of a Base facility with his personal camera. \nFinancial concerns  \nApplicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent debts (both student loans and consumer \naccounts) warrant the application of three of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the \nfinancial consideration guidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; 19(b), \nunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d; and 19(c), \u201ca history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d Each of these DCs apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nApplicant denied the allegations covering his student debt delinquencies in his \nSOR response. Nonetheless, he qualified his denials with explanations that since 2014 \nhe has had monies involuntarily deducted from his earned SS benefits and tax refunds \nin the monthly amounts of $302.54. Addressing his alleged consumer debts, Applicant \nclaimed he could not identify either reported debt and claimed the credit report listing \nthese debts was inaccurate. \nQualified denials (whether made under oath or not) to pleading allegations in an \nSOR can be considered as admitted facts that can be weighed along with other \nevidence developed during the hearing and in post-hearing proceedings. Pleadings in \nISCR proceedings and in federal and state courts in general serve a very important \npurpose of narrowing the issues open to evidentiary proof. Because Applicant\u2019s denials \nof SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b and 1.d in his SOR response incorporate his attached explanations \nof the alleged delinquent student loans, his denials cannot be considered unqualified \ndenials eligible for acceptance and consideration under the exculpatory no doctrine \nrecognized in certain situations by DOHA\u2019s Appeal Board. See ISCR Case No. 94-1137, \nat 4 (March 27, 1996) and compare with DISCR Case No. 89-0589 at 4 (App. Bd. May \n31, 1990) Applicant\u2019s debts in issue are fully documented and create some judgment \nissues. See ISCR Case No. 03-01059 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004).  \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment, and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving debt \ndelinquencies \n9 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). Applicant\u2019s \nhistory of financial difficulties associated with his long-delinquent parent-guaranteed \nstudent loans for his daughter over a period of years that he has failed to resolve (either \nvoluntarily, or even involuntarily through intercepted earmarked SS benefits) preclude \nhis taking advantage of any of the potentially available extenuating and mitigating \nbenefits. While some extenuating benefit to Applicant is warranted here based on his \nreported periods of unemployment and his wife\u2019s passing in 2013, his personal \nobligations for the student loans in issue always remained with him (both before and \nafter her death).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nthe voluntary payment of accrued debts. ISCR case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May \n21, 2008) In Applicant\u2019s case, he has failed to take any documented voluntary steps to \naddress his accumulated delinquent student loan debts and provide persuasive proof of \nhis voluntary addressing his delinquent debts in issue.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplication of MC 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem \nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss \nof employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances,\u201d has partial application.

Applicant \nacknowledged his awareness of the Base prohibitions against taking pictures on Base \nof Base facilities, his taking a picture with his personal camera while on Base, and his \nensuing termination by his own supervisor. He disputed, however, his taking a picture of \nthe Base\u2019s dial central office and claimed the picture he took in March 2012 was of a \nnearby tree.  \nCorroborative evidence of the tree incident reported to JPAS in March 2012 is \nlacking in the record, and there are plausible motivational reasons for the Base facility \nmanager\u2019s making the allegations reported in JPAS based on Applicant\u2019s account of \nwhat he previously encountered with the facility manager on the Base. Moreover, this is \nan isolated and aged incident (over eight years ago) in Applicant\u2019s employment history \nand does not represent any pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \nSo, while Applicant\u2019s knowing use of a personal camera to take a picture of Base \nproperty (whether a building structure or a tree that was possibly in the line of sight of \nthe camera) while on the Base, in violation of Base regulations and guidelines, the \nincident itself is isolated and does not reflect any pattern dishonesty or rule violations by \nApplicant. Considering all of the circumstances surrounding the reported March 12 \nincident, the conduct is mitigated. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his finances are fully compatible with minimum standards for \nholding a clearance. While Applicant is entitled to credit for his distinguished military \nCareer and civilian contributions to the defense industry, his efforts are not enough at \nthis time to overcome his failures to resolve his accumulated student loan debt \ndelinquencies with good-faith initiatives following his wife\u2019s passing in 2013. \nApplicant\u2019s past and present failures to address and resolve his accumulated \nstudent debt delinquencies reflect adversely on his ability to maintain his finances in a \nsufficiently stable manner to meet the minimum requirements for holding a security \nclearance. At this time, it is too soon to make safe predictions that Applicant will be able \nto voluntarily, or even involuntarily, resolve his accrued student debts within the \nforeseeable future. \n11 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n         \n \n                       \n \n                 \n              \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 26-year-old pipefitter employed by a defense contractor since December 2017. Applicant\u2019s mother and stepfather served on active duty in the military and are now retired. (GX 7 at 1; Tr. 29-30.) While his parents were assigned overseas, Applicant graduated from a high school on a military installation in June 2012. After graduating from high school, he worked for his uncle\u2019s business as an appliance installer. He attended college full time from June 2012 to June 2013, and was a part-time student for a few months in 2013 and 2016 but did not receive a degree. (GX 7 at 2.) He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from April 2015 to June 2017 and received an other than honorable (OTH) administrative discharge. He held a security clearance in the Navy. (GX 1 at 13-18.) Applicant married in July 2015 and divorced in April 2018. He has a six-year-old child from this marriage. He now lives with his fianc\u00e9e, who has three children from a previous relationship, and they had a child together in September 2020. (Tr. 27-28). On October 5, 2015, a female sailor notified the Fleet and Family Services Center at the base where she was assigned that she had been sexually assaulted by Applicant. On October 6, 2015, The Fleet and Family Services Center notified the base Naval Criminal Investigation Service (NCIS) office that the female sailor had reported a sexual assault and that a sexual assault forensic examination had been performed at the base hospital.

On \nApril 24, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD \nCAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuidelines J, cross-alleged under E. The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. \nOr.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \nApplicant answered the SOR in an undated document, denied the allegations, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge.

On July \n31, 2020, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the \nhearing was scheduled for October 7, 2020. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 7 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified but did not present the testimony of any other witnesses or submit any \ndocumentary evidence. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on October 19, 2020. \nApplicant admitted during cross-examination that he had used marijuana daily \nsince his discharge from the Navy in June 2017, and that he had not disclosed his \nmarijuana use in his SCA. (Tr. 42-47.) Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to \nconform to the evidence by adding an allegation of marijuana use under Guideline J \n(Criminal Conduct). I denied Department Counsel\u2019s motion. (Tr. 47.) \nOn November 4, 2020, after reviewing the transcript and the documentary \nevidence submitted at the hearing, I reconsidered my denial of Department Counsel\u2019s \nmotion to amend the SOR. I reopened the record, granted Department Counsel\u2019s motion, \nand made additional amendments of the SOR on my own motion. The SOR has been \namended as follows: \n \nAdd subparagraph 1.b under Guideline J as follows: \u201cYou illegally used marijuana \ndaily from June 2017 to October 2020.\u201d \nAdd subparagraph 2.b under Guideline E as follows: \u201cWhen you submitted your \nElectronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) on April 12, 2018, you \nanswered \u2018No\u2019 to the question in Section 23, asking if you had illegally used any drugs or \ncontrolled substances in the last seven years, and you did not disclose your daily \nmarijuana use from June 2017 to October 2020.\u201d \nAdd paragraph 3, alleging conduct under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse), and add subparagraph 3.a as follows: \u201cYou used marijuana daily \nfrom June 2017 to October 2020.\u201d \nI kept the record open until November 30, 2020, to permit Applicant and \nDepartment Counsel to object to the above amendments to the SOR, submit additional \nevidence, and submit additional argument regarding the amended SOR. I also gave \nApplicant the opportunity to request that the hearing be reopened to enable him to provide \nfurther testimony in person. Copies of my order were sent to Applicant and Department \nCounsel. Neither party objected to the amendments or offered any additional evidence or \nargument. Applicant did not request that the hearing be reopened.

Applicant\u2019s mother and stepfather served on active duty in the military \nand are now retired. (GX 7 at 1; Tr. 29-30.) While his parents were assigned overseas, \nApplicant graduated from a high school on a military installation in June 2012. After \ngraduating from high school, he worked for his uncle\u2019s business as an appliance installer. \nHe attended college full time from June 2012 to June 2013, and was a part-time student \nfor a few months in 2013 and 2016 but did not receive a degree. (GX 7 at 2.) He served \non active duty in the U.S. Navy from April 2015 to June 2017 and received an other than \nhonorable (OTH) administrative discharge. He held a security clearance in the Navy. (GX \n1 at 13-18.) \nApplicant married in July 2015 and divorced in April 2018. He has a six-year-old \nchild from this marriage. He now lives with his fianc\u00e9e, who has three children from a \nprevious relationship, and they had a child together in September 2020. (Tr. 27-28). \nOn October 5, 2015, a female sailor notified the Fleet and Family Services Center \nat the base where she was assigned that she had been sexually assaulted by Applicant. \nOn October 6, 2015, The Fleet and Family Services Center notified the base Naval \nCriminal Investigation Service (NCIS) office that the female sailor had reported a sexual \nassault and that a sexual assault forensic examination had been performed at the base \nhospital. An NCIS investigator interviewed the female sailor on the same day, and she \ntold the investigator that Applicant had sexually assaulted her by oral-vaginal and penile-\nvaginal intercourse while she verbally protested and physically struggled to make him \nstop. She showed the NCIS text messages between Applicant and her supporting her \ncomplaint, including one in which Applicant told the female sailor, \u201c[Y]ou make it seem \nlike I raped you.\u201d The NCIS Report of Investigation (ROI) states that Applicant was \ninterrogated and admitted sexually assaulting her but denied attempting to have penile-\nvaginal intercourse. The ROI reflects that a crime laboratory identified Applicant\u2019s semen \non the crotch area of the female sailor\u2019s underwear. (GX 6 at 6.) The ROI also reflects \nthat, on October 21, 2015, the female sailor told an investigator that she realized that \nApplicant did not sexually assault her \u201cas reported,\u201d because, \u201calthough she did not know \nit at the time, she actually wanted [Applicant] to engage in the described sexual activity \nwith her.\u201d (GX 6-7.) \nThe ROI does not include a written statement from Applicant, a written statement \nfrom the female sailor, or the laboratory reports identifying Applicant\u2019s semen on the \nfemale sailor\u2019s underwear. However, in November 2018, Applicant was interviewed by a \nsecurity investigator regarding the SCA he had submitted in April 2018. The interview \nincluded questioning about the NCIS ROI. Applicant denied sexually assaulting the \nfemale sailor. (GX 7 at 7.) He told the security investigator that he and the sailor had been \ncasually dating for one or two months. He was still married at the time but did not tell the \nfemale sailor that he was married. On October 2, 2015, the female sailor suggested that \nthey get a hotel room for the weekend, because they had been unable to do so on the \nprevious weekend to celebrate Applicant\u2019s birthday. Applicant picked up the female sailor \n3 \n\n \nat her barracks on the evening of October 3. They were both in \u201cA\u201d school, residing in \nbarracks, and required to have a \u201cbuddy\u201d whenever they left the base. Applicant signed \nthe female sailor out as her \u201cbuddy.\u201d They arrived at the hotel late at night. Applicant \nconsumed six or seven strong alcoholic drinks and was intoxicated.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nApplicant told the investigator that they began kissing with the lights off. He \nremoved her underwear with her help, and he began giving her oral sex. When the female \nsailor complained that he was being too rough, he stopped the sexual activity and went \nto sleep. The next morning, the female sailor told Applicant that she did not like his rough \nbehavior with her. Applicant apologized and told her that he did not intend to be rough. \nAccording to Applicant, they stayed at the hotel, \u201changing out and joking, until the morning \nof Sunday, October 5, when Applicant took the female sailor back to her barracks. (GX 7 \nat 6.) \nOn October 6, 2015, Applicant was given a \u201cprotective order,\u201d requiring him to stay \naway from the female sailor. During the security interview in November 2018, he told the \nsecurity investigator that he admitted to the NCIS that he had sexually assaulted her, \nbecause the NCIS investigator told him that witnesses at the hotel had heard the female \nsailor screaming, and the NCIS had retrieved text messages from the female sailor\u2019s \ncellphone that were consistent with her accusations. He also told the security investigator \nthat, while the protective order was in effect, the female sailor contacted him by telephone \na couple of times, told him that \u201cshe was going to make the situation right,\u201d and said that \nshe felt bad about what she had said about him. (GX 7 at 7.) At the hearing, Applicant \nadmitted calling the female sailor once, in violation of the protective order, but he testified \nthat all other communication was indirect through mutual friends. (Tr. 24, 37-38.) \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that while he was performing oral sex on the \nfemale sailor, she told him that she was uncomfortable, and he stopped and went to sleep. \nHe testified that he apologized on the next morning for being \u201ca tad bit aggressive.\u201d They \n\u201chung out\u201d in the hotel room all day, except for shopping for food and snacks. He testified \nthat they cuddled and watched television, and that he was with the female sailor when \nshe talked to her family on FaceTime. (Tr. 40.) On Monday morning, he was surprised \nwhen he was required to report to the NCIS for questioning. (Tr. 21-23.) \nAt the hearing, Applicant initially denied that he attempted to have penile-vaginal \nintercourse with the female sailor. He could not explain why his semen was found on her \nunderwear. (Tr. 34-35.) He then admitted that it was possible that he attempted to have \npenile sex with her, but he did not remember it because he was intoxicated. (Tr. 35.) Upon \nfurther questioning, he testified that he remembered trying to have penile sex, but she \nsaid \u201cNo\u201d and he stopped. (Tr. 54.) He initially testified that he remembered being \nquestioned by NCIS investigators, and that the questioning was recorded, but upon \nfurther questioning, he testified that he did not remember the interrogation and did not \nknow if he admitted having penile-vaginal sex with the female sailor. (Tr. 36-37, 52.) \nBetween October 2015 and June 2017, Applicant\u2019s commanding officer and \nexecutive officer were reassigned, and their replacements had no knowledge of the facts \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nof the case except for the information in the files. (GX 7 at 7.) On a date not reflected in \nthe record, Applicant was charged with sexual assault in violation of Article 120, Uniform \nCode of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 920. (GX 3.) Sexual assault is a felony, \ntriable by court-martial, and punishable by dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay \nand allowances, and confinement for 30 years. Manual for Courts-Martial (2016 ed.), Part \nIV, \u00b6 45.e.(2). The charges, which included an allegation of forcible anal intercourse, were \nreferred to an investigating officer in accordance Article 32, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 832 (the \nmilitary equivalent of a grand jury). The female sailor declined to testify. The investigating \nofficer recommended dismissal of the charges. On January 18, 2017, the command staff \njudge advocate recommended against prosecution. (GX 4.) NCIS closed its report on \nJune 19, 2017. \nOn February 16, 2017, Applicant appeared before his commanding officer, a Navy \ncaptain, and admitted that he was guilty of adultery. His commanding officer imposed \nnonjudicial punishment under Article 15, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 815, for adultery, in violation \nof Article 134, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 934. Applicant\u2019s punishment was reduction in pay \ngrade, forfeiture of $1,732 of his pay, and restriction to quarters for 60 days. (GX 4.) \nAfter Applicant received nonjudicial punishment, his command initiated \nadministrative separation for serious misconduct. Applicant waived his right to a hearing \nbefore a board of officers and was discharged on June 23, 2017, with an OTH discharge. \nThe Sexual Assault Disposition Report lists the basis for Applicant\u2019s discharge as \n\u201ccommission of a serious offense\u201d and lists the offense that was the basis for separation \nas a \u201csexual assault offense.\u201d (GX 2; GX 4 at 3.) At the hearing, in this case, Applicant \ntestified that he did not request a hearing to contest the allegation of serious misconduct \nbecause his lawyer advised him not to talk to anyone about the incident, and he assumed \nthat the advice applied to an administrative discharge board. (Tr. 57-58.) In his closing \nstatement, he explained that when he went to captain\u2019s mast instead of a court-martial, \nhe was thankful for not facing 30 years in the brig and registering as a sex offender, and \nhe focused on moving on with his life, not realizing that he might need a security clearance \nfor future jobs. (Tr. 64-65.) \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that he started drinking alcohol heavily after he \nwas accused of sexual assault. He realized that he was drinking too much, and that he \nstopped drinking after he was discharged from the Navy in June 2017. Department \nCounsel then asked him, \u201cDo you do anything else, any marijuana, anything like that?\u201d \nHe responded that he had been smoking marijuana daily from the date of his discharge \nfrom the Navy until the day before the hearing. He explained that he used marijuana to \ncontrol his anxiety and depression because he was unable to obtain anxiety medications \nfrom the Veterans\u2019 Administration. (Tr. 42-47.) The record does not reflect whether \nDepartment Counsel had a factual basis for questioning Applicant about marijuana use \nor whether Applicant\u2019s disclosure of his marijuana use was an unexpected answer to a \ngeneral exploratory question. \nWhen Applicant submitted his SCA in April 2018, he listed his military service in \nSection 13A (Employment Activities) and stated that he \u201cleft by mutual agreement \n5 \n\n \nfollowing charges or allegations of misconduct\u201d and described the allegation as adultery. \n(GX 1 at \n \n 16.) In Section 15 (Military History), he disclosed his OTH di\n scharge and stated \nthat the reason for the discharge was, \u201cI committed adultery.\u201d In the same section, he \ndisclosed his nonjudicial punishment for adultery. (GX 1 at 19-20.) He answered \u201cNo\u201d to \na question in Section 22, asking if he had ever been charged with a felony offense, \nincluding an offense under the UCMJ. He also answered \u201cNo\u201d to a question in Section 23, \nasking if he had illegally used any drugs or controlled substances during the last seven \nyears. At the hearing, he was not questioned about his negative answer in Section 23, \nbut he admitted his failure to disclose his marijuana use. He did not offer any explanation \nfor his failure to disclose his marijuana use, either at the hearing or during the additional \ntime the record was held open after the hearing.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

The concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity \ncreates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very \nnature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.\u201d \nThe evidence of a sexual assault in this case is sparse, but it is \u201cmore than a \nscintilla\u201d and sufficient to shift the burden to Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the facts. See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., supra. \u201cOnce a concern \narises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption \nagainst the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 09-01652 at 3 \n(App. Bd.

Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9th  Cir. 1990), \ncert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). \nApplicant categorically denied committing a sexual assault during his security \ninterview in November 2018. However, his later testimony at the hearing was vague, \ncontradictory, and uncertain. He could not explain why his semen was on the female \nsailor\u2019s underwear. During his testimony, he first claimed that he did not attempt penile-\nvaginal intercourse, then claimed that he could not remember if he attempted penile-\nvaginal intercourse, and then admitted that he attempted penile-vaginal intercourse but \ndesisted when she said \u201cno.\u201d He initially testified that he remembered being questioned \nby NCIS investigators and that the questioning was recorded, but he later testified that he \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndid not remember the interrogation and did not know if he admitted having penile-vaginal \nsex with the female sailor. \nThe female sailor\u2019s statement to the NCIS on October 21, 2015 is an investigator\u2019s \ninterpretation of what she said. Although the ROI recites that the female sailor provided \na sworn statement, there is no statement from her in the record. The statement attributed \nto her in the NCIS ROI is ambiguous. It could have been a recantation of her claim that \nshe was sexually assaulted, or it could have been an admission that she expected to \nhave sexual activity with Applicant when she went to the hotel with him, but she objected \nto and resisted the rough and aggressive sexual activity when it occurred. \nI conclude that the evidence as a whole is \u201cmore than a scintilla.\u201d It is sufficient to \nraise the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \nAG \u00b6 31(e) discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces for reasons less \nthan \"Honorable.\" \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \nAG \u00b6 32(c): no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed \nthe offense; and \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6 32(a) is partially established. The alleged sexual assault occurred more than \nfive years ago, but it did not occur under unusual circumstances. Applicant\u2019s OTH \ndischarge was more than two years ago. However, his equivocal and contradictory \ntestimony at the hearing, his lack of candor in his SCA, and his daily use of marijuana \nwhile his SCA was pending adjudication cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 32(c) is not established. The NCIS ROI is sufficient to establish the sexual \nassault. Applicant\u2019s contradictory testimony at the hearing was insufficient to overcome \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe evidence against him. He had an opportunity to challenge the characterization of his \ndischarge, but instead he chose to waive his right to a hearing before an administrative \nboard. \nAG \u00b6 32(d) is not established. Applicant presented no evidence regarding his \nemployment record, and he has continued his criminal activity by his daily use of \nmarijuana and falsification of his security clearance. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe SOR, as amended, alleges that Applicant falsified his SCA, and it also cross-\nalleges the Guideline J allegations under this guideline: The concern under Guideline E \nis set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nAn omission from an SCA, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An \nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an \napplicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). An applicant\u2019s experience and level of education are relevant \nto determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information on a security clearance \napplication was deliberate. ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). \nAt the time Applicant submitted his SCA, he had served in the Navy for more than \ntwo years and had previously been granted a security clearance. He grew up in a military \nenvironment, had graduated from high school, attended college for a year, and worked in \nthe private sector for more than two years before enlisting in the Navy. He would have \nknown from his life in a military environment and his Navy service that marijuana use was \nunacceptable conduct. His daily marijuana use began almost two years before he \nsubmitted his SCA. In addition to failing disclose his marijuana use, he consistently \nunderstated the basis for his OTH in Sections 13A, 15, 22, and 23 of his SCA, as adultery, \na relatively minor offense, even though he knew that it was based on an allegation of \nsexual assault, a serious offense. \n9 \n \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s lack of candor in Sections 13A, 15, 22, and 23 of his SCA, \nregarding the basis for his OTH discharge, is not alleged in the SOR, I have considered \nit for the limited purpose of determining his state of mind when he failed to disclose his \nmarijuana use, to evaluate his credibility, to consider whether he has demonstrated \nsuccessful rehabilitation, and as part of my whole-person analysis. ISCR Case No. 03-\n20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). Based on Applicant\u2019s lack of candor throughout his \nSCA and his inconsistent testimony at the hearing, I conclude that his failure to disclose \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhis daily marijuana use was deliberate. Thus, I conclude that the following disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline are established: \nAG \u00b616(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress \nby a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: . . . engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. . . . \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate \nthe stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \nAG \u00b6 17(f): the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of \nquestionable reliability. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. Applicant made no effort to correct his SCA until he \nwas cross-examined at the hearing. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. Sexual assault in violation of Article 120, UCMJ, is \na felony. Applicant was punished for a lesser offense because the female sailor declined \nto testify in a court-martial. Deliberate falsification of an SCA is a serious offense that \n\u201cstrikes at the heart of the security clearance process.\u201d ISCR Case No. 09-01652 (App. \nBd. Aug. 8, 2011.) \nAG \u00b6 17(d) is not fully established. Applicant admitted his marijuana use at the \nhearing, and attributed it to his inability to obtain medications for his stress and anxiety. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHowever, he submitted no evidence or counseling or other treatment for his habitual \nmarijuana use. \nAG \u00b6 17(f) is not established. Although the evidence of the sexual assault is \nsparse, it is sufficient, for the reasons set out above in the discussion of Guideline E, to \nqualify as \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d of a sexual assault within the meaning of the Directive. \nApplicant admitted daily use of marijuana at the hearing. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAppendix B to the Adjudicative Guidelines prohibits granting or renewing a security \nclearance to \u201can unlawful user of a controlled substance.\u201d Applicant\u2019s admissions during \nthe hearing establish the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline:  \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); and \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nNeither of the above mitigating conditions are established. Applicant has \npossessed and used marijuana daily since his discharge from the Navy in June 2017 and \ncontinuing to the day before his hearing. \n, \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines E, J, and H in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines E, J, and H, and evaluating all \nthe evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated \nthe security concerns raised by his criminal conduct, personal conduct, and drug use. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline H:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(Government \nExhibit (GE) 1) On August 15, 2019, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under \nExecutive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry, \nFebruary 20, 1960; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; as amended, and Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guidelines F (financial \nconsiderations) and B (foreign influence).

On February \n19, 2020, the case was assigned to me. On March 5, 2020, DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing, setting the hearing for March 26, 2020.

On February 24, 2021, \nDOHA issued a notice setting Applicant\u2019s hearing for March 15, 2021; however, that \nhearing was cancelled because of unavailability of a party. On March 17, 2021, DOHA \nissued a notice setting Applicant\u2019s hearing for March 19, 2021. (HE 1B) Applicant waived \nhis right under the Directive to 15 days of notice of the date, time, and location of the \nhearing.

(HE 3) He also \nprovided mitigating information. (Id.) He denied the remaining SOR allegations. (Id.) His \nadmissions are accepted as findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 52-year-old employee of a DOD contractor who is employed \noverseas. (Tr. 28) For his first three marriages, he was married from 1989 to 1994, from \n1995 to 2001, and from 2004 to 2012. (Tr. 55, 61; GE 1 at 24-25) In 2016, he married his \nfourth wife. (GE 1 at 22-23) His two children are ages 15 and 30. (Tr. 29; GE 1 at 27-28) \nIn 2016, he received a college education-related certificate. (GE 1) He requires 35 \nadditional college credits to receive his bachelor\u2019s degree. (Tr. 29; GE 1) \nApplicant served 24 years in the Air Force, and in June 2013, he was honorably \nretired as a master sergeant (E-7). (Tr. 30, 54, 56) He received three Meritorious Service \nMedals (MSM) while he was on active duty. (Tr. 82) He completed numerous training \ncourses. (AE A) After retiring from the Air Force he worked overseas for almost eight \nyears as an expert in munitions. (Tr. 30-31) He was recently promoted to be a \nsuperintendent. (Tr. 31) \nFinancial Considerations \nThe SOR alleges financial consideration security concerns based on six \nallegations. The status of each allegation is as follows: \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b allege Applicant failed to timely file his federal and state \nincome tax returns for tax years 2014, 2016, and 2017. He has resided overseas since \n2013.

IRS website, Eligibility for Military Tax Benefits, \nhttps://www.irs.gov/individuals/military/eligibility-for-military-tax-benefits. (AE G) \nAccording to Applicant\u2019s state of residence Department of Taxation and Revenue, \nApplicant does not need to file for an extension to file his tax return in his state of reference \nbecause the state \u201chonors [his] federal automatic extension of time to file.\u201d (AE I at 2) \nApplicant believed that he was entitled by IRS and state tax rules not to file his tax returns \nuntil he returned to the United States from his overseas deployments. (Tr. 43-45) \nNotwithstanding Applicant\u2019s right not to file federal income tax returns under IRS and state \ntax filing rules, he elected to file his tax returns in 2018. He has filed all required tax \nreturns. (Tr. 44-45) He intends to timely file all future required tax returns. (Tr. 72) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges Applicant owes $479 in delinquent state taxes for tax year 2017. \nApplicant indicated he was not required to file a state tax return, and thus, he did not owe \ntaxes. (SOR response at 3) He also believed he did not have to file a state tax return \nbecause he was no longer a resident of the state. (Tr. 45) He may be incorrect about not \nneeding to file a state tax return because he retained his home in the state and may \ntherefore continue to be subject to that state\u2019s taxes.

(Tr. 47) He did not contact the state and inform the state he was \nno longer a resident. (Tr. 72) He has not registered to vote in any state in the last seven \nyears. (Tr. 73) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges Applicant has an account placed for collection for $765. \nApplicant said he was overseas when his credit card was illegally used in the United \nStates. (SOR response at 3) He indicated this debt is not his debt, and he is the victim of \nidentity theft. (Id.) Applicant\u2019s January 26, 2021 credit report indicates he disputed his \nresponsibility for the debt with the credit reporting company. (Tr. 48; GE 7) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges Applicant\u2019s mortgage account is more than 120 days delinquent \nin the approximate amount of $7,962 on a total balance of $253,178. In 2009, Applicant \npurchased his residence for $290,000 in the state where he was filing his state tax returns. \n(Tr. 50-51) He understood when he obtained the funds from the mortgage company that \nhe was assuming the responsibility to make his mortgage payments. (Tr. 67) He was on \nactive duty and stationed at a nearby Air Force base. (Tr. 50-51) He said activity at the \nAir Force base was subsequently reduced.

He said the nearest town is economically depended on the Air Force base. (Tr. \n51) He was solely responsible for the mortgage. (Tr. 52) He was earning about $3,000 \nper month when he qualified for the loan. (Tr. 52) He received a pay raise after he retired \nfrom the Air Force and became employed by a DOD contractor. (Tr. 62) \nFrom 2009 until September 2013, Applicant lived in his home. (Tr. 53) He made \nhis mortgage payments until March 2019. (Tr. 55, 65) He chose to stop making payments \non his mortgage for five reasons: (1) his home has been on the market for six years; (2) \nthe missions at the nearby Air Force base changed; (3) in January 2019, the house was \nvandalized, and items were stolen from it such as furniture and appliances; (4) real estate \nvalues in the area of his residence decreased; and (5) the fair market value of his \nresidence may be down to about $160,000 to $170,000. (Tr. 57-58, 68, 86; SOR response \nat 4) In January 2019, two vehicles and other items were stolen from his residence. (SOR \nresponse at 4) He filed a police report and insurance claim for $30,000 after the 2019 \nburglary because of damage to his residence; however, his insurance claim was not paid. \n(Tr. 83, 87) He stopped having the house cleaned after February 2019. (Tr. 88) Around \nJune 2019, he ended his relationship with a real estate agent who was attempting to \nmarket his property. (Tr. 88) He did not employ another real estate agent. (Tr. 88) Then \nin 2021, there was a second theft from his house where the house was basically cleaned \nout including parts of the plumbing. (Tr. 84) He has not yet filed a police report concerning \nthe second theft. (Tr. 84) \nA real estate agent told Applicant around August 2020 that there was an offer to \npurchase his residence; however, the real estate agent said it was about $50,000 under \nexpectations. (Tr. 85) The real estate agent suggested he let the house go into foreclosure \nbecause there was no interest from purchasers apparently at the listed price. (Tr. 58-59) \nThe mortgage was already delinquent at the time the real estate agent suggested he let \nthe property go into foreclosure. (Tr. 68) He had some contacts from potential buyers; \nhowever, none of them resulted in offers acceptable to the mortgage company. (Tr. 89) \nHe did not detail the amounts of offers or indicate he actually provided them to the \nmortgage company. He did not indicate the mortgage company\u2019s acceptable price or how \nmuch he would have to pay to complete the sale. \nApplicant believed the mortgage lender foreclosed on his house; however, he had \nnot heard for sure what happened. (Tr. 59) He did not have any idea about how much his \nliability might be. (Tr. 60) He was essentially waiting to hear from the mortgage lender \nabout whether they wanted money from him. (Tr. 59-61) He indicated after paying his \nmonthly child support of $800, and his $1,891 monthly mortgage payment, that his \nmonthly remainder was about $3,000. (Tr. 65-66, 78, 83) He was capable of continuing \nto make his mortgage payments. (Tr. 66-67, 80) There was no outside event in March \n2019 that caused him to stop making his mortgage payments aside from his decision that \nhe was losing money by making his payments and his recognition that his property was \nvalued less than the mortgage or \u201cunderwater.\u201d (Tr. 72) \nApplicant\u2019s January 26, 2021 credit report reflects: the Department of Veterans \nAffairs (VA) guaranteed repayment of his mortgage; the date of last payment was \nFebruary 2019; the past due amount was $41,839; and the monthly payment was $1,880. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(GE 8) Applicant was unaware of the amount the VA guarantee.

(SOR response, enclosures) \nThe Philippines \nThe U.S. and the Philippines maintain a close relationship stemming from the U.S. \ncolonial period (1898-1946), the bilateral security alliance bound by the Mutual Defense \nTreaty of 1951, and common strategic and economic interests. Relations are based on \nstrong historical and cultural links and a shared commitment to democracy and human \nrights. In 1946, the United States recognized the Philippines as an independent state and \nestablished diplomatic relations. The U.S. has since designated the Philippines as a Major \nNon-NATO Ally. Former U.S. President Barack Obama visited the Philippines in 2014 to \nreaffirm the United States' commitment to the security alliance, and to discuss the United \nStates' strategic vision for the bilateral relationship. President Obama noted the two \nnations' strong people-to-people ties, commitment to peace and stability in the Asia-\nPacific region, and commitment to build prosperity for our people and the global economy. \nAlthough the U.S. closed its military bases in the Philippines in 1992, the two \nnations have maintained security cooperation ever since. The Manila Declaration, signed \nin 2011, reaffirmed the 1951 U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty as the foundation \nfor a robust, balanced, and responsive security partnership. Since 2012, the Philippines \nhas played a key role in the U.S. goal of rebalancing foreign policy priorities to Asia, \nparticularly as maritime territorial disputes between China and other claimants in the \nSouth China Sea have intensified. \nIn 2014, the two countries confirmed agreement of an Enhanced Defense \nCooperation Agreement (EDCA), which helps promotes the peace and stability that has \nunderpinned Asia's remarkable economic growth over the past six decades. The EDCA \nallows for the increased presence of U.S. military forces, ships, aircraft, and equipment \nin the Philippines on a nonpermanent basis and greater U.S. access to Philippine military \nbases. As part of the security alliance, Members of the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps have \nconducted Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT) exercises with the \nArmed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) since 1995. The training exercises develop strong \npartnerships that contribute to the greater peace and stability of the region and allow both \nnations to gain valuable experience and increase our interoperability. The U.S. and the \nPhilippines have the same mission, that is, to further strengthen the Philippines' security \noperations and maritime domain awareness capabilities. The U.S. has begun to provide \n$40 million in technical expertise, training, and equipment through the Global Security \nContingency Fund. The U.S. is also helping to construct a Philippine National Coast \nWatch Center in Manila. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn the past decade, the Philippines has been one of the largest recipients of U.S. \nforeign assistance in Southeast Asia, including over $143 million following Typhoon \nYolanda (Haiyan) in 2013. U.S. assistance in the Philippines fosters broad-based \neconomic growth; improves the health and education of Filipinos; promotes peace and \nsecurity; advances democratic values, good governance, and human rights; and \nstrengthens regional and global partnerships. The U.S. and the Philippines have a strong \ntrade and investment relationship, with over $25 billion in goods and services traded. As \nthe Philippine's third-largest trading partner, the U.S. is one of the nation\u2019s largest foreign \ninvestors. The Philippines has been among the largest beneficiaries of the Generalized \nSystem of Preferences program for developing countries, which provides preferential \nduty-free access to the U.S. market. In 1989, the two countries signed a bilateral Trade \nand Investment Framework Agreement and a tax treaty. \nAn enhanced engagement of 15 U.S. government agencies is aiming to address \nthe most significant constraints to growth in the Philippines and to stimulate inclusive \neconomic expansion through a Partnership for Growth (PFG). USAID and the Millennium \nChallenge Corporation account for the majority of PFG financial resources amounting to \nmore than $750 million. The two countries have made enormous strides in deepening the \neconomic linkages between them, including: Removal of the Philippines from the Special \n301 Watch List, based on significant advances in the protection and enforcement of \nintellectual property rights and considerable progress on worker rights issues in the \nPhilippines, which will allow the U.S. government to close a Generalized System of \nPreferences (GSP) review of worker rights in the Philippines without any change to the \nPhilippines' GSP trade benefits. \nThe Philippines and the U.S. share extensive people-to-people ties. About 350,000 \nAmericans reside in the Philippines, and approximately 600,000 U.S. citizens visit the \ncountry each year. There are approximately four million people of Philippine descent in \nthe U.S. The Philippines has the world's oldest continuous operating Fulbright program: \nthe Philippine-American Educational Foundation, established in 1948. The U.S. has had \na Peace Corps program in the Philippines for over 50 years. \nThe Philippines is a multiparty, constitutional republic with a bicameral legislature. \nPresident Rodrigo Roa Duterte, elected in May 2016, began his constitutionally limited \nsix-year term in June 2016. \nSince the 1980\u2019s at least five Americans, including Leandro Aragoncillo, have been \nconvicted of espionage, or espionage-related crimes, involving transmission of \ninformation to the Philippines. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, there have \nbeen numerous criminal cases concerning export enforcement related to the Philippines. \nAs of September 2020, the U.S. Department of State travel advisory for the \nPhilippines is Level 3: Reconsider Travel Due to COVID-19. Additionally, Exercise \nIncreased Caution due to crime, terrorism, civil unrest, a measles outbreak, and \nkidnapping. It directed Americans: Do Not Travel to the Sulu Archipelago, including the \nsouthern Sulu Sea, due to crime, terrorism, civil unrest, and kidnapping and to Marawi \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCity in Mindanao due to terrorism and civil unrest. It suggested citizens reconsider travel \nto other areas of Mindanao due to crime, terrorism, civil unrest, and kidnapping. It noted \nthat the Philippine government has declared a State of National Emergency on Account \nof Lawless Violence in Mindanao. Philippine government law enforcement agencies are \nengaged in a nationwide counternarcotics campaign that has resulted in a sharp increase \nin violence between police and individuals suspected of involvement in the drug trade. As \npart of this campaign, law enforcement is engaged in aggressive search and buy-bust \noperations that could affect foreigners. The U.S. Department of State has assessed \nManila as being a high-threat location for terrorism directed at or affecting official U.S. \ngovernment interests. Terrorist violence continues to affect primarily the Mindanao region, \nin the country\u2019s south.  \nAt least eight terrorist groups operate in the Philippines. For more than a decade, \nterrorists, insurgents, and criminal actors have carried out major attacks against civilians. \nIn 2018, four notable attacks resulted in the deaths of two to eleven people and numerous \nadditional people were injured. In 2019, the Philippines made the list of the top 10 \ncountries with the most terrorist incidents and the most terrorist casualties. There were \n351 incidents in the Philippines, with 1,192 casualties (3 percent of the global total of \ncasualties). This constitutes a small increase in incidents over 2018, as well as a seven \npercent increase in casualties. The most deadly attack involved a bombing of a Mass at \nthe Jolo Cathedral in Sulu killing 23 people and wounding 102. Multiple suicide bombings \nin the Philippines were a new phenomenon for the region. On August 24, 2020, dual \nsuicide bombings in Jolo, Sulu and Mindanao, killed 15 people and injured 77 others. \nThe State Department designated the Philippines a major money laundering \njurisdiction in 2019. The Philippines\u2019 growing economy and geographic location within key \ntrafficking routes place it at elevated risk of money laundering and terrorism financing. \nRecent growth in the online gaming industry also presents increased risk. Corruption and \nhuman trafficking constitute some of the principal sources of criminal proceeds. Insurgent \ngroups operating in the Philippines derive funding from kidnapping for ransom and \nnarcotics and arms trafficking. Additionally, the large volume of remittances from Filipinos \nliving abroad increases the monitoring burden on anti-money laundering authorities. \nIn its most recent annual human rights report, the State Department reported that \nsignificant human rights issues included: unlawful or arbitrary killings, including \nextrajudicial killings, by and on behalf of the government and non-state actors; reports of \nforced disappearance by and on behalf of the government and non-state actors; torture \nby and on behalf of the government and non-state actors; arbitrary detention by and on \nbehalf of the government and non-state actors; harsh and life-threatening prison \nconditions; arbitrary and unlawful interference with privacy; significant problems with the \nindependence of the judiciary; the worst forms of restrictions on free expression and the \npress, including violence, threats of violence, and unjustified arrests or prosecutions of \njournalists, censorship, and the existence of criminal libel laws; corruption; and unlawful \nrecruitment or use of child soldiers by terrorists and groups in rebellion against the \ngovernment. \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConcerns about police impunity increased significantly following the sharp \nincrease in killings by police in 2016. Significant concerns also persisted about impunity \nfor the security forces, civilian national and local government officials, and powerful \nbusiness and commercial figures. Slow judicial processes remained an obstacle to \nbringing government officials allegedly involved in human rights abuses to justice. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).

Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd.

AG \u00b6 19(f) is not established because Applicant was not required to file \nfederal and state tax returns until he returned to the United States from overseas, and \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c are refuted. \nAG \u00b6 20 lists financial considerations mitigating conditions which may be applicable \nin this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \n13 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Foreign Influence \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d for $765 was generated while Applicant was overseas, and \nhe was not responsible for it. He disputed it under AG \u00b6 20(e). In September 2019, he \npaid the $931 debt described in SOR \u00b6 1.f. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.f are mitigated. \nApplicant listed five reasons why he stopped making his mortgage payments: (1) \nhis home has been on the market for six years; (2) the missions at the nearby Air Force \nbase changed; (3) in January 2019, the house was vandalized, and items were stolen \nfrom it such as furniture and appliances; (4) real estate values in the area decreased; and \n(5) the fair market value of his residence may be down to about $160,000 to $170,000. \nThese were circumstances beyond his control that reduced the fair market value of his \nresidence, and indicated to him that he would lose money if he sold his residence. \nApplicant did not act responsibly under the circumstances. He had sufficient \nincome to continue making the mortgage payments on the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e. He walked \naway or abandoned his responsibility for the debt when he was unable to sell his \nresidence for a sufficient amount to pay the mortgage or meet his desires. He did not \nprovide proof that he contacted the creditor or VA to seek alternative resolutions of the \ndebt through a deed in lieu of foreclosure, short sale, or other good faith negotiated \nresolution. He did not prove that he could not have sold the property for less than the \nmortgage amount and accepted responsibility for part or all of the loss to the mortgage \ncompany through financing from the mortgage creditor, another creditor, or the VA. He \ndid not prove that the state had an anti-deficiency provision excusing him from liability. \nHe did not prove the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e is resolved. \nOver the last two years, Applicant has owed his mortgage company thousands of \ndollars in interest payments and real estate taxes. He had sufficient income to have \nmaintained his mortgage in current status. There is insufficient evidence showing \nApplicant\u2019s failure to pay his mortgage was a responsible, prudent, and good-faith \ndecision. He is receiving a substantial income and had the financial resources to pay his \nmortgage. Applicant failed to establish mitigation of financial considerations security \nconcerns. \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d stating: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \n14 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \nin this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law, one brother-in-law, and one sister-in-law are citizens \nand residents of the Philippines. One of Applicant\u2019s brothers-in-law is a citizen of the \nPhilippines, and Applicant, his spouse, and the brother-in-law live at the same overseas \nlocation. Applicant occasionally communicated with his mother-in-law and siblings-in-law. \nApplicant\u2019s spouse is a citizen of the Philippines and a permanent resident of the United \nStates. She is close to her family in the Philippines. \nWhen an allegation under a disqualifying condition is established, \u201cthe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct or \ncircumstances . . . and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Direct or objective evidence of \nnexus is not required.\u201d ISCR Case No. 17-00507 at 2 (App. Bd. June 13, 2018) (citing \nISCR Case No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)). \nThe mere possession of close family ties with relatives living in a foreign country \nis not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if an applicant, his \nor her spouse, or someone sharing living quarters with them, has such a relationship with \neven one person living in a foreign country, this factor alone is sufficient to create the \npotential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 08-02864 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2009) (discussing \nproblematic visits of applicant\u2019s father to Iran). \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, his or her immediate family members, and this presumption includes in-\nlaws.

Mar. 13, 2017)). \nAnother important consideration is the nature of a nation\u2019s government\u2019s relationship with \nthe United States. These factors are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an \napplicant\u2019s family members living in that country are vulnerable to government coercion \nor inducement.  \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government, the government ignores the rule of law including \nwidely accepted civil liberties, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, the government is engaged in a counterinsurgency, terrorism causes a \nsubstantial amount of death or property damage, or the country is known to conduct \nintelligence collection operations against the United States. The relationship of the \nPhilippines with the United States, the situation in the Philippines, including crime and \nterrorism, place a burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that his and his \nspouse\u2019s relationships with any family member or friend living in or visiting the Philippines \ndo not pose a security risk. Applicant should not be placed into a position where he might \nbe forced to choose between loyalty to the United States and concerns about assisting \nsomeone living in or visiting the Philippines. \nThe Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 03-24933, 2005 DOHA LEXIS 346 at *20-*21 \nn. 18 (App. Bd. 2005), explained how relatives in a foreign country have a security \nsignificance: \nThe issue under Guideline B is not whether an applicant\u2019s immediate family \nmembers in a foreign country are of interest to a foreign power based on \ntheir prominence or personal situation. Rather, the issue is whether an \napplicant\u2019s ties and contacts with immediate family members in a foreign \ncountry raise security concerns because those ties and contacts create a \npotential vulnerability that a foreign power could seek to exploit in an effort \nto get unauthorized access to U.S. classified information that an applicant \n-- not the applicant\u2019s immediate family members -- has by virtue of a security \nclearance.

Oct. 22, 2004)) (discussing \nTaiwan). \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives, criminals, or terrorists from \nor in the Philippines seek or have sought classified or economic information from or \nthrough Applicant or his family, nevertheless, it is not prudent to rule out such a possibility \nin the future. International terrorist groups are known to conduct intelligence activities as \neffectively as capable state intelligence services, and the Philippines has a significant \nproblem with terrorism and crime. Applicant\u2019s family in that country \u201ccould be a means \nthrough which Applicant comes to the attention of those who seek U.S. information or \ntechnology and who would attempt to exert coercion upon him.\u201d ADP Case No. 14-01655 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 9, 2015) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-02950 at 3 (App. Bd. May 14, \n2015)). \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with people who are living in the Philippines or visiting \nthat country create a potential conflict of interest because terrorists could place pressure \non those living in the Philippines in an effort to cause Applicant to compromise classified \ninformation. These relationships create \u201ca heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d under AG \u00b6 7. Department Counsel produced \nsubstantial evidence of Applicant and his spouse\u2019s relationships with people living in the \nPhilippines or citizens of the Philippines and has raised the issue of potential foreign \npressure or attempted exploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e) apply, and further inquiry \nis necessary about potential application of any mitigating conditions. \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group,\ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and\nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the\nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the\nU.S. interest; \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent \nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or \nexploitation; \n17 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the agency head or designee; and \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country. \nAs indicated in the disqualifying conditions section, Applicant has three in-laws who \nare citizens and residents of the Philippines. The Appeal Board has concluded that contact \nevery two months or more frequently constitutes \u201cfrequent contact\u201d under AG \u00b6\u00b6 7 and 8. \nISCR Case No. 14-05986 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 14, 2016). See also ISCR Case No. 04-\n09541 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2006) (finding contacts with applicant\u2019s siblings once every \nfour or five months not casual and infrequent and stating \u201cThe frequency with which \nApplicant speaks to his family members in Iran does not diminish the strength of his family \nties.\u201d). .\u201d). Frequency of contact is not the sole determinant of foreign interest security \nconcerns based on connections to family. \u201c[I]nfrequency of contact is not necessarily \nenough to rebut the presumption an applicant has ties of affection for, or obligation to, his \nor her own immediate family as well as his or her spouse\u2019s immediate family.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 17-01979 at 4 (App. Bd. July 31, 2019). \nA key factor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d Applicant has significant connections to the United \nStates. Applicant was born in the United States, served in the Air Force for 24 years, and \nis not and never has been a citizen of the Philippines. His children, siblings, and other \nrelatives are citizens and residents of the United States. He intends to permanently reside \nin the United States. \nIt is important to be mindful of the United States\u2019 relationship with and historical \ninvestment in the Philippines. The Philippines is a U.S. ally in combatting terrorism after \n9/11. The Philippines and the United States are allies with the goal of maintaining the \nPhilippines territory and freedom of the seas. \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the United States must be weighed against the \npotential conflict of interest created by his relationships with his spouse\u2019s relatives who \nare citizens and residents of the Philippines. They are at risk from criminals, terrorists, \nand human rights violations of the Philippines government. Applicant\u2019s access to \nclassified information could theoretically add risk to his spouse\u2019s relatives living in the \nPhilippines. \nIn sum, Applicant and his spouse\u2019s connections to his spouse\u2019s relatives who are \nliving in the Philippines are much less significant than his connections to the United \nStates. AG \u00b6 8(b) is established and it fully mitigates foreign influence security concerns \nunder Guideline B. \nWhole-Person Concept \n18 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines F and \nB are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 52-year-old employee of a DOD contractor who is employed \noverseas. He served 24 years in the Air Force, and in June 2013, he was honorably retired \nas a master sergeant. He received three MSMs when he was on active duty. He \ncompleted numerous training courses. After retiring from the Air Force he worked for \nalmost eight years overseas as an expert in munitions. He was recently promoted to be \na superintendent. \nApplicant\u2019s character evidence supports his access to classified information. The \ngeneral sense of his character evidence is that he is knowledgeable, diligent, \nprofessional, responsible, reliable, honorable, trustworthy, and honest. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has previously emphasized that security clearance \ndeterminations are not a debt-collection procedure. A security clearance adjudication is \nan evaluation of an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Applicant \nstopped paying his mortgage in March 2019, which was two years before his hearing. He \nowed more than $40,000 in delinquent interest and real estate taxes to his mortgage \ncompany. Most importantly, he had the means to continue making his mortgage \npayments. He did not provide proof that he took reasonable, prudent, and good-faith \nactions to communicate his intentions to the mortgage company and the VA and to \nresponsibly resolve his mortgage debt. He did not mitigate the mortgage debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.e. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, \nExec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the \nfacts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Foreign influence security \nconcerns are mitigated; however, unmitigated financial considerations security concerns \n19 \n\n \n \n20 \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrelating to his handling of his mortgage debt lead me to conclude that grant of a security \nclearance to Applicant is not warranted at this time.  \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT  \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d:  \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nAgainst Applicant \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nFOR APPLICANT \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

His delinquent debt consists of student loans, a credit card, a \nmedical account, and a returned check. In his answer, he admits to allegations 1.a., \nand 1.b. \nHe claims that he paid allegations 1.c., and 1.e. through garnishment. \nAllegation 1.d., he cannot answer because he does not know what debt it pertains to. \nCredit reports of the Applicant dated May 22, 2018; and January 31, 2019 confirm this \nindebtedness. (Government Exhibits 2 and 3.) \nApplicant served on active duty in the United States Army from 1982 to 1994. He \nthen served in the reserves until 1997. \nApplicant has worked for the same company \nsince 2002, and only management has changed over the years. Applicant has held a \nsecurity clearance since 2002 without incident. \nHe currently earns about $60,000 \nannually, but with regular overtime and bonuses his salary is about $80,000 annually. \nApplicant provides all financial support for his large family, consisting of seven \nchildren and his wife. His wife is a stay-at-home mother who cares for the children and \nmaintains the house. All but one of his children live at home. Applicant pays the family \nbills. He states that it has been a constant financial struggle for him to pay the bills and \nfeed his large family. He was also sending his two oldest children to private school. He \nadmits that he was spending beyond his means. (Tr. p. 51.) Applicant also paid to \nrenovate a home that he and his siblings own. \nApplicant attended college, and earned an Associate\u2019s degree. To afford to \nattend college, he obtained student loans totaling about $30,000. (Tr. p. 30.) After \ngraduating, he began making payments toward his student loans. In 2012, Applicant\u2019s \nidentity was stolen, and he lost communications with his creditors. Before the identity \ntheft he would receive bills from the creditors.

(Tr. p. \n45.)  \nOn April 4, 2019, a wage garnishment order was issued for delinquent student \nloans in the amount of $48,208.44.  (Government Exhibit 4.)  The garnishment \ncontinued until June 2020 when it stopped.  Applicant believes that he currently owes \nabout $40,000 in student loan debt.  Applicant submitted a copy of a signed \nrehabilitation agreement dated January 29, 2021, which allows him to voluntarily \nresume his student loan payments without garnishment.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing \nExhibit A.)  Department Counsel offered that due to the pandemic, The Care Act \nprovides that student loan payments are temporarily deferred through September 30, \n2012.  Payments are not required for many accounts, including accounts that are in \ncollections.  Individuals are allowed to make voluntary payments that are counted \ntoward repayment, but they are not required to make payments until October 2021.   \nApplicant also borrowed from his 401k on two separate occasions to make his \nlease payment on his house. He is currently paying that money back. (Tr. p. 57-58.)  \nHe states that at one point, he started working on repairing his credit but he never \ncompleted the process. (Tr. p. 31.) Besides the student loan debts, Applicant is not \ncertain about what he owes the other creditors listed in the SOR. He understands that \nhe needs to get a better handle on his finances by contacting his creditors to determine \nwhat, if anything, he actually owes them. \nThe following debts became delinquent: \n1.a. Applicant is indebted to the US Department of Education for an account that \nwas placed for collection in the approximate amount of $18,076. (Government Exhibit \n5.) Beginning in March or April 2019, Applicant\u2019s wages were garnished in the amount \nof $437 monthly to pay this debt and the debt listed in 1.b. \nIn June 2020, the \ngarnishment was stopped. According to the provisions of The Care Act, implemented \nbecause of the pandemic, the Applicant is not required to make payments until October \n2021. (Tr. pp. 40-41 and 55-56.) This debt is not currently delinquent. \n1.b. Applicant is indebted to the US Department of Education for an account that \nwas placed for collection in the approximate amount of $21,576. (Government Exhibit \n5.) Beginning in March or April 2019, Applicant\u2019s wages were garnished in the amount \nof $437 monthly to pay this debt and the debt listed in 1.a. \nIn June 2020, the \ngarnishment was stopped. According to the provisions of The Care Act, implemented \nbecause of the pandemic, the Applicant is not required to make payments until October \n2021. (Tr. pp. 40-41.) This debt is not currently delinquent. \n1.c \nApplicant is indebted to a creditor for an account that was placed for \ncollection in the approximate amount of $2,560. (Government Exhibit 5.) Applicant \nbelieves that he paid this debt off through garnishment last year. (Tr. pp. 43-44.)

Applicant is indebted to a creditor for a medical account placed for collection \nin the approximate amount of $154. Applicant does not know the current status of this \naccount. He believes it is a late payment for a medical bill that was supposed to be paid \nthrough his insurance.  (Tr. p. 51.) \ne. Applicant is indebted to a creditor for a returned check that is past due in the \napproximate amount of $127. (Government Exhibit 5.) Applicant\u2019s wages may have \nbeen garnished to pay this debt. Applicant is not sure. (Tr. p. 47.) This debt has been \npaid. \nIn addition to the above debts, Applicant states that he has other debts, but that \nthey are not yet delinquent.  In December 2020 Applicant had a medical emergency that \ngenerated medical bills totaling about $9,000.  (Tr. p. 61.)  He is currently in \nnegotiations with the creditor.  He also still owes $4,000 for his wife\u2019s prenatal care for \nthe birth of their youngest child.  He is also in negotiations with this creditor.  (Tr. p. 61-\n62.)  Applicant states that although he does not follow a budget, he is careful to first \nensure that he pays his lease and his utilities, his car payment and his other regular \nmonthly bills.  Then he tries to pay any outstanding debt, if he can afford to do so.  He \nplans to pay all of his bills.  Applicant states that he has never received any financial \ncounseling, and feels that he has been under financial stress to get his bills paid. \nApplicant submitted copies of his most recent credit reports dated July 5, 2021. \nThey do not show any delinquent collection accounts. (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit \nA.) \nGuideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct \nApplicant denies the allegation set forth under this guideline that he intentionally \nfalsified his security clearance application from the Government. Applicant completed a \nsecurity clearance application dated March 24, 2018. Section 26 of the application, \nconcerning his financial record, asked him, if in the past seven years, has he ever \ndefaulted on any type of loan? . . . Whether in the past seven years, has he ever had \nbills or debts turned over to a collection agency?. . .Whether in the past seven years, \nhas he had any account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to \npay as agreed?. . . And, whether in the past seven years, has he been over 120 days \ndelinquent on any debt not previously entered? The Applicant answered, \u201cNO\u201d, to these \nquestions. \nApplicant failed to disclose the delinquencies set forth above under \nGuideline F. \nApplicant states that when he completed the recent, updated application in 2018, \nhe did not deliberately intend to conceal his delinquent debts from the Government. \nApplicant was asked to expedite the application, and he completed it as quickly as he \ncould. He explained that he did not think that there was much to change on his \napplication, and so he used most of the same template from the previous application of \n2012, and only made minor changes that he thought were needed, such as his address. \n(Tr. p. 36.) He now realizes that he should have spent more time on the application to \nensure that every question was answered correctly. Applicant states that during his \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nbackground investigation he told the investigator that if anything throws a red flag in this \ninvestigation it is his credit report.

(Tr. p. 40.) \nDepartment Counsel notes, however, that Applicant was not that rushed to \ncomplete the application, since he took the time to delete a debt he had previously \ndisclosed in 2012 to a creditor for a delinquent credit card debt in the amount of \n$10,000.  (Tr. p. 37.) \nLetters of recommendation from Applicant\u2019s supervisor and coworkers attest to \nhis good character. Applicant is well respected among his peers. He is described as a \ndedicated employee and a hard worker. Over the years, Applicant has been promoted \nfrom an entry level trainee to a supervisory position on his work shift. He is self-\nmotivated, positive, trustworthy, and reliable. His work product consistently \u201cexceeds \nexpectations.\u201d He is recommended for a security clearance.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial hardship. He is trying to support his large \nfamily on one income. He is having problems meeting his needs. He follows no set \nbudget, and has never received any financial counseling. The evidence is sufficient to \nraise the above disqualifying conditions. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under Financial Considerations are potentially \napplicable under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent  or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \nApplicant has been paying his delinquent debts, although some through \ngarnishment. His most recent credit reports do not show any delinquent collection \naccounts. \nHe has made a good-faith effort to resolve his debts and has been \nsuccessful. \nAccordingly, the financial consideration security concern has been \nmitigated. This guideline is found for Applicant. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for the personal conduct guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I have \nconsidered each of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 below: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \nNone of the mitigating conditions are applicable. Applicant knew at the time he \ncompleted the security clearance application on March 24, 2018, that he had delinquent \ndebt. It was his duty and responsibility to ensure that the information provided to the \nGovernment is accurate and truthful to the best of his ability. Even if Applicant was \nrushing to get the application submitted to his management, he took the time to delete a \ndebt that he had listed on his previous security clearance application in 2012. This \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nshows that he reviewed the question carefully enough to make this change, and that he \nknew he had delinquent debts at the time he completed the application.  Applicant was \nalso careless by not taking time to review each question carefully before submitting the \napplication to the Government.  Applicant signed the application, and in doing so, \nattested to its truthfulness.  Applicant answered, \u201cNO,\u201d to questions on his security \nclearance questionnaire concerning his financial record, which he should clearly have \nadmitted.  There is no excuse for this dishonesty or carelessness, and clearly calls his \ncharacter into question.  Applicant\u2019s conduct precludes a finding of good judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness.  To be entrusted with the privilege of holding a security \nclearance, one is expected to be honest and truthful at all times, and to know and \nunderstand the rules and regulations that apply to them, and to always abide by those \nrules.  Under the particular facts of this case, Applicant has not demonstrated this \nawareness.  By failing to answer these questions correctly on the security clearance \napplication, his conduct does not show honesty, integrity, good judgment or reliability.  \nAt this time, Applicant does not meet the qualifications for access to classified \ninformation.  Accordingly, the personal conduct security concern has not been \nmitigated.  This guideline is found against Applicant.     \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Applicant is well-respected by his \nsupervisor and coworkers on the job. His work product is exceptional. However, he \nhas been unable to resolve his financial problems, and he has not been candid and \ntruthful on his security clearance application regarding his delinquent debt. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Personal Conduct security concern. \nThe Financial Considerations \nsecurity concern has been mitigated. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.e.   \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a.  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 65-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security clearance for his job as linguist, translator, and interpreter (Arabic) for a company that does business in the defense industry. He has worked for this company since 2017. His work is in support of the U.S. armed forces in the country of Kuwait. Before his current job, he was unemployed from March 2017 to about September 2017. Before that, he worked as a security guard for different firms during 2011-2017. He also had a period of unemployment from November 2010 to July 2011. Applicant was born in Sudan to Sudanese parents. He completed high school in Sudan in 1980, and then earned a diploma in Arabic Language and Islamic Studies from a university in Sudan in 1985. He continued his education in the United States where he attended two different educational institutions. Applicant came to the United States in 2001 as a refugee. (Tr. 15-16) He felt compelled to depart Sudan in 1990 because he believed he would be targeted as an educated Sudanese African as the regime was Sudanese Islamic. (Tr. 36-37) He lived in Egypt during 1990-1994, in Saudi Arabia during 1994-1999, and again in Egypt during 1999-2001. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2006, and his most recent 2 U.S. passport was issued in 2017. (Exhibit 1) He explained that it was his \u201cdream\u201d to become a U.S. citizen and he is very proud of doing so. (Tr. 16) He has no family members in the United States, as they are all presently",

(Exhibit 1) This document is commonly known as a security \nclearance application. He provided additional information during a background \ninvestigation. (Exhibits 2, 3, 4, and 8) Thereafter, on May 1, 2019, the Department of \nDefense Consolidated Adjudications Facility, Fort Meade, Maryland, sent Applicant a \nstatement of reasons (SOR), explaining it was unable to find that it was clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation. The SOR is similar to a complaint. It detailed the factual reasons for the \naction under the security guideline known as Guideline B for foreign influence due to his \nfamily ties to Sudan, and under Guideline F for financial considerations due to his \nhistory of financial problems. \nApplicant answered the SOR and provided supporting documentation, and his \nanswer was considered to be complete in March 2020. He admitted all the factual \nallegations under both security guidelines. He also requested an in-person hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Thereafter, in July 2020, he retained legal counsel to \nrepresent him in this proceeding. \nThe hearing took place as scheduled on November 5, 2020. Applicant appeared \nin person after traveling from his overseas duty location in Kuwait. Both Department \nCounsel and Applicant\u2019s counsel offered documentary exhibits, which were admitted as \nGovernment Exhibits 1-9 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A-R. Applicant was called as a \nwitness and was subject to cross-examination by Department Counsel. \nI took administrative or official notice, which is similar to judicial notice, of certain \nfacts concerning the country of Sudan per Department Counsel\u2019s written request. \n(Exhibit 9) In addition, on my own motion, I took administrative notice of two matters \nconcerning Sudan. The first was that the President of the United States, on October 19, \n2020, announced that he intended to request that Sudan be removed from the State \nDepartment\u2019s list of State Sponsors of Terrorism. The second was that Sudan had \nrecently entered into a peace agreement with the country of Israel in an effort to \nnormalize relations with that country. (Tr. 12-13) The hearing transcript (Tr.) was \nreceived on November 13, 2020. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 65-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security \nclearance for his job as linguist, translator, and interpreter (Arabic) for a company that \ndoes business in the defense industry. He has worked for this company since 2017. His \nwork is in support of the U.S. armed forces in the country of Kuwait. Before his current \njob, he was unemployed from March 2017 to about September 2017. Before that, he \nworked as a security guard for different firms during 2011-2017. He also had a period of \nunemployment from November 2010 to July 2011. \nApplicant was born in Sudan to Sudanese parents. He completed high school in \nSudan in 1980, and then earned a diploma in Arabic Language and Islamic Studies \nfrom a university in Sudan in 1985. He continued his education in the United States \nwhere he attended two different educational institutions. \nApplicant came to the United States in 2001 as a refugee. (Tr. 15-16) He felt \ncompelled to depart Sudan in 1990 because he believed he would be targeted as an \neducated Sudanese African as the regime was Sudanese Islamic. (Tr. 36-37) He lived \nin Egypt during 1990-1994, in Saudi Arabia during 1994-1999, and again in Egypt \nduring 1999-2001. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2006, and his most recent \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nU.S. passport was issued in 2017. (Exhibit 1) He explained that it was his \u201cdream\u201d to \nbecome a U.S. citizen and he is very proud of doing so. (Tr. 16) He has no family \nmembers in the United States, as they are all presently living in Sudan as citizens of \nthat country. \nApplicant\u2019s parents are deceased. His father passed away many years ago and \nhis mother remarried. His mother passed away more recently in January 2019. (Exhibits \nD and R) His two brothers and sister are citizens of and residents in Sudan. The same \nis true for his five half-brothers and two half-sisters. Applicant is also married to a citizen \nof Sudan, and she along with her mother and father reside in Sudan. He traveled to \nSudan from January 2010 to April 2010; from April 2011 to July 2011; from March 2017 \nto July 2017; and mostly recently from December 2019 to January 2020. (Exhibit 2; Tr. \n30-31) \nOne brother was a senior police officer with the Sudanese Ministry of Interior but \nretired several years ago. (Tr. 19-20) Applicant spoke with him by telephone in January \n2019 when their mother passed away to express his condolences. (Tr. 20) He also \nspoke with his other brother at the same time. Before their mother\u2019s passing, he spoke \nwith the latter brother twice a month because that brother was taking care of their \nmother. (Tr. 20-21) He has not spoken with his two brothers since January 2019. \nApplicant\u2019s sister was a member of the Sudanese Parliament during the Bashir \ngovernment, but she is no longer a member after the regime change. (Tr. 21-22) He \nspoke with his sister when their mother passed, but otherwise had not spoken with her \nin ten years. (Tr. 22) His sister is now a housewife. (Tr. 34) \nConcerning his five half-brothers, Applicant is aware that one is employed as a \ncustoms police officer with the Sudanese Ministry of Interior. (Tr. 23) He is unaware of \nthe employment activities of the other half-brothers. (Tr. 34-35) He is also aware that his \ntwo half-sisters are housewives as they have husbands and children of their own. (Tr. \n35) He has little to no communication or relationships with his half-siblings. (Tr. 23-24)  \nApplicant married a Sudanese woman in 2014. (Exhibit 1) She gave birth to a \nson in 2016, but the child passed away after a year due to malaria. (Tr. 29-30, 40-41) \nHe has no other children from the marriage. His spouse continues to live in Sudan as a \nhousewife and he provides her financial support of about $200 monthly, which is \nsufficient to meet her needs. He retained the services of an immigration lawyer who, as \nof October 2020, anticipated filing an immigration petition soon despite the current \nrestriction of immigration from Sudan. (Exhibit E) In addition to his spouse, Applicant\u2019s \nmother-in-law and father-in-law are also citizens of and residents in Sudan. \nApplicant does not have business, financial, or property interests in Sudan. He \nhas checking and savings accounts with a U.S. financial institution but no other financial \naccounts here. He does not own a home or other real estate in the United States. He is \na registered voter and has exercised that right. He also has a driver\u2019s license issued by \nhis state of residence in the United States. He is using a friend\u2019s address as his current \nresidential address in the United States.

(Exhibit 9) Of particular note is that Sudan \nwas designated a State Sponsor of Terrorism in 1993 and remained so until its removal \nfrom the State Department\u2019s list in December 2020. The Sudanese government was \noverthrown in April 2019, and the transition to a new government was not entirely \npeaceful. Sudan\u2019s removal from that list represents a fundamental change in the U.S.-\nSudan relationship and allows for the United States to provide more robust support for \nSudan. Sudan has also had a dismal human-rights record.  \n \nThe SOR alleged and Applicant admitted a history of financial problems. In \naddition to his admissions, the factual allegations in the SOR are established by the \ndocumentary evidence. (Exhibits 5-7) The SOR concerns seven delinquent debts \n(charged off or in collection) in amounts ranging from $85 to $6,137 for a total of about \n$9,462. He attributed the delinquent accounts to the low income he earned working as a \nsecurity guard while at the same time paying for educational expenses. (Tr. 28-29) He \npresented reliable documentation showing that he paid or settled the seven delinquent \naccounts during 2019-2020. (Exhibits I, J, K, L, M, P, and Q). Those matters are found \nto be resolved. \nLaw and Policies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \n1  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10th  Cir. 2002) (no \nright to a security clearance).  \n \n \n \n2 484 U.S. at 531. \n3 484 U.S. at 531. \n4 ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5  Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \nadmitted or proven; and (3) an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable clearance decision.6  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDiscussion \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations, the suitability of an applicant may \nbe questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive \nindebtedness or financial problems or difficulties. The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n5 ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004). \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTurning to the matters in mitigation, Applicant\u2019s financial problems are related to \nthe low income he earned working as a security guard while at the same time paying for \neducation expenses. He did not deliberately shirk his financial responsibilities. Once he \nstarted earning a higher income, he was able to pay or settle the seven delinquent \naccounts at issue in the SOR. Given the circumstances, the mitigating conditions at AG \n\u00b6 20(b) and AG \u00b6 20(d) apply in Applicant\u2019s favor. The security concern under Guideline \nF is decided in Applicant\u2019s favor.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply to this case. \n \nThe gravamen of the SOR under Guideline B for foreign influence is whether \nApplicant\u2019s ties to Sudan should disqualify him from access to classified information. \nUnder Guideline B for foreign influence, the suitability of an applicant may be \nquestioned or put into doubt due to foreign contacts and interests. The overall concern \nis set forth in AG \u00b6 6 as follows: \nForeign contacts and interests, including but not limited to business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise a security concern under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \nAG \u00b6 7(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \nand \nAG \u00b6 7(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's \nobligation to protect classified or sensitive information or technology and \nthe individual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information or technology. \nThe starting point for the analysis is the country of Sudan. In light of the facts and \ncircumstances described in Department Counsel\u2019s request for administrative notice, the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nheightened-risk element is satisfied. Accordingly, given Applicant\u2019s family ties to Sudan, \nchiefly his spouse, the Government has established its case under Guideline B. The \nabove disqualifying conditions are raised by the evidence. \nThe guideline provides that certain facts and circumstances may mitigate foreign \ninfluence concerns. Given the evidence here, I considered the following mitigating \nconditions: \nAG \u00b6 8(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \nAG \u00b6 8(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, \nthat the individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interest. \nSudan\u2019s relationship with the United States and the heightened risk it presents \nplace a heavy burden on Applicant to mitigate the security concern. With that said, \nApplicant has indicators of a mature, stable, responsible, and trustworthy person. He \nhas a long record of employment in the United States. He is not wealthy, but his \nfinancial interests are in the United States. He traveled at his own expense from his \noverseas duty location for the hearing in the case. He was serious at the hearing. He \nappears to have cooperated fully and provided truthful information during the security \nclearance process. \nI have considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s family ties to Sudan, chiefly his \nspouse who he supports financially, in light of the heightened risk presented by the \ncountry of Sudan, and I remain concerned. The entirety of his family ties are to Sudan \nwhile he has no family ties to the United States. At the same time there appear to be no \ncircumstances regarding Applicant personally that give rise to doubt about his suitability \nfor a security clearance, but that by itself does not carry sufficient weight. \nGiven the totality of facts and circumstances, I cannot conclude that it is unlikely \nApplicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of the \nUnited States and the interests of the Sudanese government or his family members who \nare citizens of and residents in Sudan. Likewise, I cannot conclude that there is no \nconflict of interest. AG \u00b6 8(a) and AG \u00b6 8(b) are not fully applicable. \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts or concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighted the evidence \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. Accordingly, I \nconclude that he did not meet his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c \u2013 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.g: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant did not timely file her federal (SOR 1.a) or her state (SOR 1.b) income tax returns for the 2013 through 2017 tax years. It was also alleged that Applicant owed $15,042 for two delinquent debts (SOR 1.c and 1.d). In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. (Answer) In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 62-year-old employee of a defense contractor for whom she has worked since August 2017. Applicant was married between 1975 and 1985, and between 1986 and 2001. She has three adult children. (GX 1) Applicant lives and works in State A after relocating from State B in November 2010 seeking work after a period of unemployment in State B. She had been told that she could find work for a State A school system; however, after relocating, the job did not materialize. Applicant eventually found work in March 2011 but had to leave that job five months later to attend to a family emergency in State B. She was unemployed for the next 2 five months before finding work at a temporary staffing company on a one-year contract which ended in February 2013. She again was unemployed until July 2013. She has been steadily employed since then.

Based on the results of the ensuing \nbackground investigation, adjudicators for the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) could not determine, as required by Security Executive \nAgent Directive (SEAD) 4, Section E.4, and by DOD Directive 5220.6, as amended \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n(Directive), Section 4.2, that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nto continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. \nOn March 29, 2019, DOD CAF issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts that raise security concerns under the adjudicative guideline for financial \nconsiderations (Guideline F). The guideline cited in the SOR was one of the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) issued by the Director of National Intelligence on December 10, 2016, to \nbe effective for all adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested that her case be \ndecided based on the written record without benefit of a hearing before an administrative \njudge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). In September 2019, \nDOHA Department Counsel provided Applicant with a file of relevant material (FORM) in \nsupport of the SOR. On October 16, 2019, Applicant requested a hearing. Her request \nwas granted and the case was assigned to me on January 16, 2020. \nThis matter was originally set to be heard in person on March 31, 2020. On March \n20, 2020, I cancelled that hearing in response to pandemic-related restrictions imposed \nby the Secretary of Defense. On August 9, 2021, I rescheduled this case for hearing on \nAugust 30, 2021 via web-based video conferencing. The parties appeared as scheduled. \nDepartment Counsel proffered Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 6, which were admitted \nwithout objection. Applicant testified but produced no other witnesses or documentary \nevidence. I held the record open after the hearing to allow her additional time to submit \nadditional information. I received a transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on September 8, 2021. \nThe record closed on September 10, 2021 after Applicant failed to make any post-hearing \nsubmissions. \nFindings of Fact \n \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant did not timely file her \nfederal (SOR 1.a) or her state (SOR 1.b) income tax returns for the 2013 through 2017 \ntax years. It was also alleged that Applicant owed $15,042 for two delinquent debts (SOR \n1.c and 1.d). In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. \n(Answer) In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 62-year-old employee of a defense contractor for whom she has \nworked since August 2017. Applicant was married between 1975 and 1985, and between \n1986 and 2001. She has three adult children. (GX 1) \nApplicant lives and works in State A after relocating from State B in November \n2010 seeking work after a period of unemployment in State B. She had been told that she \ncould find work for a State A school system; however, after relocating, the job did not \nmaterialize. Applicant eventually found work in March 2011 but had to leave that job five \nmonths later to attend to a family emergency in State B. She was unemployed for the next \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfive months before finding work at a temporary staffing company on a one-year contract \nwhich ended in February 2013. She again was unemployed until July 2013. She has been \nsteadily employed since then. (GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 39 \u2013 40, 61, 68 \u2013 70) \nApplicant timely filed her 2011 federal and state income tax returns using the tax \npreparer her sister used. Her sister paid for those services. Thereafter, Applicant did not \nfile either her federal or state returns for the tax years 2013 through 2017. She stated that \nshe could not afford a tax preparation service on her own and that she could not figure \nout how to file her returns herself. After she was interviewed for her clearance by a \ngovernment investigator (subject interview) in May 2018, she started working to file her \npast-due returns. She claimed that all of her past-due returns have been filed and that \nthose returns were not filed until 2020. I held the record open after the hearing for the \nexpress purpose of giving Applicant more time to submit copies of those returns. She did \nnot submit anything before the record closed. (GX 1 \u2013 3; Tr. 36 \u2013 37, 41 \u2013 48, 74, 82) \n \nApplicant attended a college-level technical school between March 1989 and \nSeptember 1991, when she was awarded an associate\u2019s degree. She financed the tuition \nfor her studies through a series of federally subsidized student loans totaling about \n$5,000. Applicant made payments on those loans until about 1995. Thereafter, the only \npayments made on those loans, the current balance of which Applicant estimates to be \nabout $40,000, has been through involuntary diversions of her federal income tax refunds. \n(GX 1; GX 2; Tr. 49 \u2013 51, 71 \u2013 72) \nApplicant does not know if she owes any unpaid federal taxes. In response to \ninterrogatories from DOD CAF adjudicators, she established that a debt for unpaid State \nA income taxes for 2013 was satisfied by involuntary wage garnishment in August 2018. \nApplicant did not submit any additional information about her past-due state income tax \nreturns. In addition to stating that she could not afford to have her tax returns prepared \nfor her, Applicant also stated that the fact her federal tax refunds have been diverted to \npay her student loan debts \u201chas a lot to do with why [she does not] want to file (her tax \nreturns).\u201d (GX 3; Tr. 49, 52) \nThe debt at SOR 1.c arose in State A. Applicant traded in a used car with significant \nmechanical problems on another used car. She had paid on the loan for the trade-in for \nabout two years but still had a significant balance remaining on that loan. The financing \nfor the newly-acquired used car did not resolve the remaining balance on the trade-in. \nApplicant believes she entered into a bad deal because she was desperate to replace her \nunreliable trade-in. She has since financed the purchase of a different car and has made \nmonthly payments as required. She has not taken any action to pay or otherwise resolve \nthe SOR 1.c debt. (GX 2 \u2013 4; Tr. 36, 54 \u2013 60, 79 \u2013 81) \nThe debt at SOR 1.d arose in State B when Applicant defaulted on a car loan after \nbeing unemployed for six months and the vehicle was involuntarily repossessed.

(GX 1 \u2013 4; Tr. 36, 38, 54 \u2013 60, 77 \n\u2013 79) \nApplicant\u2019s current finances are stable. In addition to her car loan, she pays her \nmortgage and other regular monthly expenses as required. (Tr. 60 \u2013 65) \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518) \n4 \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant did not timely file her federal and state income tax returns for at least five \nconsecutive tax years. Available information also shows she owes at least $15,000 for \ntwo delinquent car loans, which remain unresolved. Further, the record does not support \nher claims that she has filed her past-due income tax returns and that she is now current \nin her tax reporting obligations. This information reasonably raises a security concern \nabout Applicant\u2019s finances that is articulated at AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nBy contrast, available information requires consideration of the following pertinent \nAG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAvailable information does not support any of these mitigating conditions. \nApplicant did not support her claim that she has resolved her tax-filing delinquencies. Her \ntwo delinquent car loan accounts remain unresolved and she has not shown that either \ndebt can reasonably be disputed. There is no indication she has made any effort to repay \nher debts or that the issues addressed in this SOR arose from any unforeseen \ncircumstances. Even were that the case, Applicant did not show that she has acted in a \nresponsible way to resolve her taxes or her personal debts. She also has not sought any \nfinancial counseling or other professional assistance to resolve these matters. On \nbalance, Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised under Guideline F. \nI also have evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed \nin AG \u00b6 2(d). The security concerns raised by the Government\u2019s information and by \nApplicant\u2019s admissions remain unresolved and sustain doubts about Applicant\u2019s suitability \nfor continued access to classified information. Because protection of the interests of \nnational security is the principal focus of these adjudications, those doubts must be \nresolved against the Applicant\u2019s request for clearance. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR (as amended) as required \nby section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information.

The \ncase was assigned to me on January 5, 2021. On January 22, 2021, DOHA issued a \nnotice scheduling the hearing for February 17, 2020. On January 29, 2021, I issued a \nCase Management Order to the parties by e-mail. It concerned procedural matters \nrelating to the health and safety of the hearing participants due to the COVID-19 \npandemic. The parties were ordered to submit and exchange their proposed exhibits in \nadvance of the hearing, and they did so. \nThe hearing convened as scheduled. At the hearing, Department Counsel offered \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1-10. Applicant offered Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A-K. \n(Applicant included AE A-E with his Answer to the SOR). All exhibits were admitted \nwithout objection. Applicant testified in person and one other witness testified by phone. \nI held the post-hearing record open until March 3, 2021, to allow Applicant the opportunity \nto submit additional information. (Tr. 116) He timely submitted 46 pages of tax documents \n(AE L) and one other document (AE M) that are admitted without objection. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript (Tr.) on February 24, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.o), each with a brief explanation. \nHis admissions and explanations are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is 35 years old. He and his wife married in 2017, after being together for \nmany years. He has six children, ages 17, 16, 13, 12, 9, and 4. Three of his children live \nwith Applicant and his wife, including a son Applicant fathered with someone else. (Tr. \n41-42, 94-97) They live together in Applicant\u2019s mother\u2019s home. (Tr. 48-49)   \nApplicant has been required to pay child support of some kind since about 2007. \nHe has been in arrears for some time, and testified that he is unsure of what he owes. He \nsaid child support has come out of his pay regularly for the last five years. He was out of \nwork for about eight months due to an injury. (Tr. 45) \nApplicant has worked as a security officer for a variety of employers in the defense \nindustry since 2007, at times working multiple jobs. (Tr. 56-58; GE 1) For a period of time \nin 2011 and 2012, he was living in another state, caring for his grandmother, and working \nodd jobs. This was one of the years for which he failed to file tax returns. (Tr. 57) \nApplicant is employed as a diplomatic security officer for a State Department \ncontractor. He currently holds a clearance. (Tr. 14-15) He said he earns about $2,500 a \nmonth, after taxes and child support. (Tr. 50-51) However, he said at hearing that he is \nnot currently working, because he did not pass a required proficiency test. He cannot \nreturn to work at the State Department until he passes the test, though he remains \nsponsored for a clearance and available for other possible assignments. This is his only \njob, so he is not currently earning any income. (Tr. 98-105) Applicant testified that he has \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nno savings account and has very little money in his checking. (Tr. 78) Applicant said his \nwife works in information technology and is a cleared government contractor. He \nestimated her annual salary at about $110,000-$115,000. (Tr. 49, 105-106) \nApplicant disclosed some delinquent debts on his SCA, in 2017, including some \nprivate debts and his child support. He also noted that he was working with a credit \ncounselor or debt consolidator. (GE 1 Tr. 62-66) He did not disclose any tax issues. (GE \n1; Tr. 68) \nApplicant failed to file his state and Federal income tax returns on time, as required, \nfor tax years 2013-2018. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b) DOHA sent him interrogatories in January \n2019, concerning his interview summary and his taxes. (GE 2, GE 3) At the time, the \ninformation he provided showed that he had unfiled tax returns. (GE 2, GE 3; Tr. 69) \nApplicant filed most of his unfiled state and federal income tax returns in bulk, in July \n2019, with the help of a tax advisor. (Tr. 70-73; AE B, C, D, E) \nApplicant believes he has now paid all his past-due taxes and that all his past-due \ntax returns have been filed. (Tr. 45-46) AE B includes a state return for tax year 2015, but \nthat year\u2019s federal return is not included in AE C. Applicant testified that he thought he \nmight not have made enough income to warrant filing a 2015 tax return. (Tr. 109-114) \nHowever, the 2015 state return details \u201cAdjusted gross income from your federal return\u201d \nof $7,239. (2015 state return, page 1, in AE B)(Emphasis added). Documentation as to \nthe 2015 federal return was not provided by the IRS in the post-hearing materials \nApplicant provided. (AE L at 22)  \nSOR \u00b6 1.o is a state tax lien for $5,497. (GE 10) Applicant believes it relates to his \nchild support issues. He believes the matter is resolved, but this is undocumented. (Tr. \n45-46)  \nApplicant attributed his tax issues to a lack of maturity, as well as the money he \nwas paying in child support. He also acknowledged that he was motivated to clear up his \ntaxes so it would not impact his clearance. He wants to rebuild his credit and make a \nbetter life for his family. (Tr. 71-72, 91-93 107-108) Applicant documented that his 2019 \ntax returns were filed on time. (AE F, AE G, AE H, AE J) He testified that he will file his \ntax returns on time in the future. (Tr.109) \nApplicant indicated that he had been working with several debt consolidators to \nresolve his debts, paying one about $300 a month. (Tr. 73-77) His most recent credit \ncounselor offers financial classes and information, and Applicant plans to participate. The \ndebt consolidation service has led to items being removed from his credit report. (Tr. 88-\n90, 114-115; AE I)  \nThe SOR debts total about $16,312. They are largely established through \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports from May 2017 and October 2018, as well as his most recent \ncredit report from January 2021, shortly before the hearing. (GE 6-GE 8). Most of the \ndebts are on GE 6, and may have dropped off later credit reports. Applicant also disclosed \nseveral of his debts on his SCA and discussed them in his background interview.

(GE 4, GE 5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c ($3,768) is a charged-off debt to a credit union. It was charged off in \n2013. (GE 7) Applicant said this was a loan he took out for his brother. He believes the \ndebt consolidation company is resolving the debt, but this is not documented. (Tr. 73-77) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($178) is a debt to a creditor bank for a credit or debit card. It is \nunresolved, though Applicant intends to pay it. (Tr. 78-79, 90; GE 8) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($904) is a debt to a homeowner\u2019s association in a timeshare \ncommunity. A judgment is outstanding. (GE 9) Applicant noted that the creditor did not \ndeliver what they had promised, and he and his wife never benefited from the \narrangement. He has been unable to resolve the matter, though he said in his Answer \nthat he was setting up a payment plan. (Tr. 80-81) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f ($2,654) and 1.g ($1,350) are past-due federal student loans relating \nto Applicant\u2019s time attending a trade school. (GE 6) He testified that he believes the debts \nhave been paid and resolved since 2019, because he no longer has money taken out of \nhis pay for the debts, he is not certain. (AE A; Tr. 50-51, 81-83, 106) AE A reflects a single \npayment of $114 in July 2019. Full payment on these two accounts is not documented. \nThese debts are unresolved. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h ($791) is a cell-phone debt in collection. (GE 6) Applicant said he has \nthe same cell carrier now, without incident. He said in his Answer that he had made two \npayments to resolve the debt, but at the hearing he disputed the debt. After the hearing, \nhe provided documentation that his cell phone bill, with the same carrier, is current. (AE \nL) This account is resolved. \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i ($459), 1.k ($208), and 1.m ($63) are medical debts in collection. (GE \n6) Applicant believes the debt consolidator should have resolved them, but this is \nundocumented. (Tr. 84-87) \nSOR \u00b6 1.j ($229) is an account placed for collection by a bank. (GE 6) Applicant \nbelieves the debt is resolved, but this is undocumented. (Tr. 85-86) \nSOR \u00b6 1.l ($180) is a cable bill in collection. (GE 6) Applicant believes the debt is \nresolved, but this is undocumented. (Tr. 86-87) \nSOR \u00b6 1.n ($31) is a debt in collection with an apartment complex. (GE 6) It \nappears unresolved. (Tr. 87-88) \nAfter the hearing, Applicant submitted 46 pages of documents he had received \nfrom the IRS about his federal taxes. (AE M) Those documents reflect that Applicant owes \n$2,200 in past due taxes for tax year 2012 and intends to pay it. (AE M at 2-6, 12-13) His \n2014 federal return reflects a refund of $587.

He holds a high-\nlevel clearance. On the basis of their long friendship, W attested that Applicant is a \u201cstand-\nup guy\u201d and good family man.

(AE L at 30, 42-47) His 2018 \nfederal tax return reflects a $1,558 refund. (AE L at 35) There is no allegation in the SOR \nof any past-due federal tax owed, and in any event, Applicant appears to owe only for tax \nyear 2012, so I will not consider this information as disqualifying conduct. \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor provided a letter attesting to Applicant\u2019s excellent \ncommunication skills. He is a supportive team player, both personally and professionally. \nHe is driven, self-confident, proactively helpful, and smart. (AE K) \nAnother friend and co-worker attested that he is discreet and does not discuss \nsensitive information, and is respectful of the rules and regulations regarding protection \nof such information. Applicant is also \u201can upstanding citizen and proactive member of the \ncommunity.\u201d He is a good father, and is supportive towards others. He is trustworthy and \nhas high integrity. (AE K) A local law-enforcement officer who has known Applicant for \nover 20 years also attested to his fine character, as did Applicant\u2019s wife. (AE K) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe AGs are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction with the factors \nlisted in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative \ngoal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person \nconcept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven \nby Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain \na favorable security decision. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:  \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Applicant has had financial delinquencies, several years of unfiled state and \nFederal income tax returns, and a state tax lien. The following AGs are applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has long held that failure to file tax returns is a security \nconcern: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No, 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed towards inducing an applicant to file \ntax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015); See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis added) \nConditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nfrom a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \n7 \n \nApplicant failed to file his state and Federal tax returns for many years. He \nattributed his tax issues to a lack of maturity and a lack of income due to having to pay \nchild support. Neither circumstance was beyond his control, so AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \nApplicant was prompted to cure the problem by the realization that his tax issues \nmight impact his eligibility for a clearance. He then filed most of his past-due tax returns \nin July 2019, after submitting his SCA, and after receiving interrogatories about his taxes \nfrom DOHA. (Applicant may well have filed all of his past-due returns at that time, but he \ndid not provide sufficient documentation that his 2015 Federal return was filed as well). \nHis history of failure to file his tax returns on time, as required, continues to cast doubt on \nhis judgment, trustworthiness and reliability. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not fully apply, even though \nhis belated actions warrant some credit under AG \u00b6 20(g). \nApplicant also incurred a variety of delinquent debts. He engaged a credit \ncounselor to help him gain better financial stability, so AG \u00b6 20(c) is partially applicable. \nHe did not provide enough evidence that his financial issues are being resolved or are \nunder control, so it does not fully apply. \nMost of Applicant\u2019s debts have now dropped off his credit report, but that fact alone \ndoes not establish that they are resolved. Applicant believes that some debts are paid, or \nare being resolved by his debt consolidator, but he did not provide documentation to \nsupport those assertions. The Appeal Board has held that \u201cit is reasonable for a Judge to \nexpect applicants to present documentation about the satisfaction of specific debts.\u201d See \nISCR Case No. 09-07091 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug 11, 2010). Whether Applicant seeks to \nestablish good-faith efforts to pay or resolve the debts under AG \u00b6 20(d) or to dispute the \nvalidity of certain debts under AG \u00b6 20(e), he did not provide sufficient documentation that \nhis debts are being paid, settled, resolved, or are no longer his responsibility. Applicant \ndid not provide enough evidence that the debts have been or are being resolved or that \nhis tax issues are sufficiently in the past to mitigate the resulting security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(c):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nI considered the testimony of his character witness and the whole person evidence \nfrom other references, from both his personal life and his job, of whom vouch for \nApplicant\u2019s character. But Applicant failed for several years to file his state and Federal \nincome tax returns on time, as required, and he only did so belatedly during the security \nclearance application process. He also has numerous old and unresolved past-due debts. \nApplicant needs to establish a consistent track record of financial stability and compliance \nwith tax filing requirements in order to mitigate financial security concerns. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not provide sufficient evidence \nto mitigate financial security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g, 1.i-1.m:   \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h:   \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

On \nNovember 5, 2009, the Department of Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him, detailing the security concerns under \nGuidelines J, D, and E, explaining why it was unable to find it clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant security clearance eligibility. DOHA acted Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; and DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive) and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG), effective September 1, 2006.

In executing the SOR, DOD CAF referenced the same authorities as DOHA had \nreferenced, with the exception of the 2006 AGs, which had since been amended on June \n8, 2017. \nOn March 19, 2020, Applicant answered the SOR, admitting the allegations and \nrequesting a hearing, whereupon the case was assigned to me on May 21, 2021. On July \n7, 2021, DOHA issued a notice of hearing, scheduling Applicant\u2019s case for July 23, 2021. \nThe hearing was held as scheduled.

In May 2009, he was sentenced to confinement for 12 \nmonths (suspended for 12 months), and placed on supervised probation for ten years. The \nsentencing order required him to register as a sex offender and to have no contact with \nanyone under the age of 18 without supervision. (Answer, Enc. 1 at 3) Moreover, Applicant \nwas placed on the state\u2019s sex offender list. (Answer, Enc. 1 at 3) \nIn August 2008, while awaiting trial, Applicant voluntarily contacted a certified sex \noffender treatment provider. (Answer, Enc. 1 at 3) Applicant started individual therapy in \nSeptember 2008 and group therapy in May 2009. He completed his therapy in late \nNovember 2009 and participated in an aftercare program from December 2009 to May \n2010. His diagnosis upon discharge from the program was depressive disorder, not \notherwise specified; impulse control disorder, not otherwise specified; and sexual abuse of \na child. His risk of recurrence was assessed as \u201clow provided he uses what he has learned \nin treatment.\u201d (Answer, Enc. 4 at 2) In September 2010, the court released Applicant from \nprobation early for good behavior. (AE A) \nIn his answer to the first SOR, Applicant stated that his misconduct with his sister-in-\nlaw occurred while he was under great emotional pressure, dealing with his then wife\u2019s \nbipolar disorder and attempts to kill herself. (Answer, Enc. 4 at 4) At the first hearing, he \ntestified that he acquired skills during his therapy that help him cope with stress, and that \nhe has a network of friends, including his rabbi whom he can depend upon for support \nwhen needed. \nAfter Applicant\u2019s first ISCR hearing, the judge credited him for being remorseful \nabout his conduct, voluntarily seeking treatment, and informing his employer and the \nmembers of his faith community about his crime. However, the judge concluded that it was \ntoo soon to conclude that he had mitigated the security concerns, given the impulse control \ndiagnosis and the recency of the conduct. (Answer, Enc. 1 at 9) \nSince the 2010 denial, Applicant has earned an associate of science degree, and an \nassociate degree of applied science in photography, specializing in visual communications. \n(AE B at 2) He graduated summa cum laude. (AE B at 3; AE E) He maintained his \noutstanding grades while being a leader in student organizations, contributing to the good \nof the larger community, and maintaining a full-time job. (AE B at 3) \nApplicant consistently receives good annual performance ratings. (AE I) In 2012, his \nsupervised probation was suspended for good behavior. (AE A) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988).

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive \nOrder 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).1   \n1 The factors under AG \u00b6 2(d) are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201ccriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d (AG \u00b6 30) \nApplicant\u2019s conviction of indecent liberties with a child by a custodian, a felony, \nraises the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime,\u201d and AG \u00b6 31(c), \n\u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally \ncharged, formally prosecuted, or convicted.\u201d \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 32: \n (a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation, including, but not limited to, \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community involvement. \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                             \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior was an isolated incident that occurred more than ten years ago. \nHe successfully completed counseling and complied with the terms of probation, leading to \nits early suspension for good behavior in September 2012. Since the incident, he has \nearned two associate degrees, has performed well on the job, and has received an award \nwhile in college that, among other things, credited him for his exceptional community \ninvolvement. Under these circumstances, AG \u00b6 32(d) applies. \nConversely, I am troubled by Applicant\u2019s testimony that he did not intend to get his \nsister-in-law, then 13 years old, intoxicated before molesting her, despite giving her two \nalcoholic drinks, one of which he characterized as \u201cliquid cocaine.\u201d Such an outlandish \nstatement calls into question both the sincerity of his contrition and his credibility. \nConsequently, I cannot conclude that his conduct no longer casts a doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 32(a) is inapplicable. \n Guideline D: Sexual Behavior \nUnder this guideline, sexual behavior is a security concern if it \u201cinvolves a criminal \noffense, reflects a lack of judgment or discretion, or may subject an individual to undue \ninfluence of coercion, exploitation, or duress.\u201d Applicant\u2019s committed a felony when he \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmolested his former sister-in-law. His conduct was compulsive, made him vulnerable to \ncriminal prosecution, and was symptomatic of an impulse control disorder. Moreover, it \nmade him vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress. Under these circumstances, the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 13 apply: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk sexual behavior that \nthe person is unable to stop or that may be symptomatic of a personality \ndisorder; and \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. \nSecurity concerns raised by sexual behavior may be mitigated if \u201cthe sexual \nbehavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such unusual circumstances that \nit is unlikely to recur and does no cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d or \u201cthe behavior no longer serves as a basis for \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress.\u201d (AG \u00b6\u00b6 14(b) and (c)). Applicant has disclosed his \nconduct to his supervisors, friends, and faith community. His registration as a sex offender \nis a matter of public record. Under these circumstances AG \u00b6 14(c) applies. Conversely, \nthe mitigating condition set forth in AG \u00b6 14(b) is inapplicable for the same reasons that the \nmitigating condition set forth in AG \u00b6 32(a) does not apply under the criminal conduct \nguideline, as discussed above. \nWhole-Person Concept \nThe steps that Applicant have taken to demonstrate that he has rehabilitated himself \nhave been commendable. More than ten years have elapsed since his conduct, and he \nhad never engaged in such conduct before the incident. \nConversely, child molestation is an extraordinarily serious crime, compounded by \nthe fact that Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law was in his care when he abused her. Applicant\u2019s \ncontention that he did not intend to get his sister-in-law intoxicated when he gave her two \nalcoholic drinks was not credible, and created the impression that he is still unable to come \nto terms with the magnitude of his transgression. Under these circumstances, doubts \nremain about Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness. Having considered this case in the context of the \nwhole-person concept, I conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security \nto grant Applicant access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

(Item 1.) The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective for cases after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 23, 2019, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on February 25, 2020. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on September 29, 2020, and the hearing was \nconvened as scheduled on November 12, 2020. The Government offered five exhibits, \nreferred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 5, which were admitted without objection. \nThe Applicant provided no exhibits.

DOHA received \nthe transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on November 18, 2020. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 42 years old and married, but separated, with three children. He is \nseven classes short of a bachelor\u2019s degree and has military training. He is employed by \na defense contractor as an Information Technology Cyber Security Architect. He is \nseeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment.  \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleges that Applicant failed to timely file his Federal \nincome tax returns for a number of years. He also failed to timely file state income tax \nreturns for State #1, for State #2, and for State #3. Applicant owes delinquent Federal \nand state back taxes, medical debt, child support, and consumer debt totaling \napproximately $125,000. He is also behind on his mortgage payments. In his answer, \nApplicant admits each of the allegations listed in the SOR, with the exception of n, p, q, \nr, s, and z, which he states have fallen off of his credit report and believes is no longer \nowing. Applicant\u2019s credit reports dated August 10, 2017; March 1, 2019; and November \n10, 2020, confirm this indebtedness. (Government Exhibits 3, 4 and 5.)  \nApplicant served on active duty in the United States Army from 2002 through \n2007. He joined the Army Reserves in 2016, and is currently an E-5. Applicant held a \nsecurity clearance from March 2002 when he joined the Army, until June 2014. \nApplicant worked for a defense contractor in Afghanistan from 2009 to 2013. He \ntestified that until October 2013, he always paid his taxes and his bills on time, and lived \nwithin his means. (Tr. p.35.) He was able to accumulate things such as a house, cars, \nand debt, and was able to properly manage the expense. At that time, he was earning \nabout $167,000 annually. (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A.) In October 2013, when \nhis daughter ran away from home, Applicant took emergency leave from Afghanistan to \ncome back to the states to find her. Accusations of child abuse against his wife, \ninstigated a court hearing in November 2013. The court found against the Applicant \nand his wife, and they lost custody of their children. Applicant then returned to work in \nAfghanistan. (Tr. pp. 21 - 23.) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \nAt this point, Applicant made a life altering decision to quit his good paying job in \nAfghanistan that he had for almost five years, and return to the United States to fight for \ncustody of his children. Applicant understood the consequences. He knew that his \nfinances would be negatively impacted, preventing him from paying his bills. Applicant \ntestified that his priority was his family, including their long term safety and stability. \nApplicant spent the next three years in court fighting for custody of his children. He \nspent his money on attorneys and court fees. He was eventually awarded custody of \nhis youngest daughter. (Tr. p. 37.) \nIn July 2017, Applicant was hired by his current employer. At that time he knew \nthat his job would require a security clearance. He did not tell his employer about his \nexcessive indebtedness. \nThe following delinquent debts in the SOR remain owing and are of security \nconcern: \n1.a., through 1.c. Applicant failed to timely file Federal income tax returns for years \n2013; 2014; 2015; 2016; 2017; and 2018. Applicant states that he has now filed his \nFederal income tax returns. Supporting documentation shows that these returns have \nnow been filed. (Government Exhibit 2.) There is no supporting documentary evidence \nto show that his state income tax returns have been filed. Applicant has not filed and/or \ndid not timely file his state income tax returns for State #1 for tax years 2013 and 2014; \nfor State #2 for tax years 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018; or for State #3 for tax years \n2018 and 2019. \n1.d., through 1.j.  Applicant became indebted to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for \nnumerous tax years.  He owes the IRS for tax year 2010 in the amount of $1,838.30; tax \nyear 2011 in the amount of $23,013.56; tax year 2012 in the amount of $13,369.51; tax \nyear 2013 in the amount of $11,159.51; tax year 2014 in the amount of $815.87; tax \nyear 2016 in the amount of $829.36; and tax year 2018 in the amount of $431.29.  \n(Government Exhibit 2.)  Applicant testified that in total, he believes that he owes \napproximately $53,000 in back taxes to the IRS.  (Tr. 38.)  At one point he had set up a \npayment plan to pay $1,000 monthly, but has been unable to comply with the \narrangement because he is now unemployed.  Applicant has not contacted the IRS to \nexplain his situation to them.  (Tr. p. 41.)    \n1.k., through 1.m.  Applicant owed back taxes to State #2 for tax year 2013 in the \namount of $3,014.91, and for tax year 2018 in the amount of $2,123.60.  He claims that \nhe has filed a dispute with this state tax authority, and he does not owe the taxes.  \nApplicant failed to submit any documentary evidence to substantiate this claim.  (Tr. p. \n40.)  He also owed back taxes to State #3 for tax year 2018 in the amount of $485.  \nApplicant admits that he has not paid these taxes.  (Tr. p. 39.)  Applicant submitted \ncopies of income tax returns for tax years 2018 and 2019 for State #3.

Applicant owes numerous consumer debt. This includes a mortgage \naccount that is past due in the amount of $18,907 with a total balance owed of $83,725. \nThe account remains delinquent, but has been frozen in foreclosure pending the COVID \n19 pandemic. A second mortgage account on the same house is past due in the \namount of $841 with a total balance owed of $2,120. A debt owed to a creditor was \ncharged off in the amount of $8,811. A debt owed to a creditor was charged off in the \namount of $5,960.  \n1.s. Applicant owed child support arrears in the amount of $4,944. He testified that in \nMay 2019, when the court transferred child custody to him, the court also erased all \npast due child support.  (Tr. pp. 77 and 78, and Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A.) \n1.t., through 1.v. A debt owed to a creditor was placed for collection in the amount of \n$2,650. A debt owed to a creditor was placed for collection in the amount of $2,192. A \ndebt owed to a creditor was placed for collection in the amount of $2,101.  \n1.w. Applicant owed child support arrears in the amount of $1,786. He testified that in \nMay 2019, when the court transferred child custody to him, the court also erased all \npast due child support.  (Tr. pp. 77 and 78, and Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A.) \n1.x., through 1.cc. A debt owed to a creditor was placed for collection in the amount of \n$1,725. A debt owed to a creditor was charged off in the amount of $1,704. A debt \nowed to a creditor was charged off in the amount of $1,474. A debt owed to a creditor \nwas placed for collection in the amount of $1,079. A debt was owed to a creditor was \ncharged off in the amount of $570. A debt for a medical account is owed in the amount \nof $270. (Government Exhibits 3, 4 and 5.) There is no evidence in the record to show \nthat any of these debts have been paid. \nIt is noted that some of the debts set forth above do not appear on Applicant\u2019s \nmost recent credit report. (Government Exhibit 5.) Under the particular circumstances \nof this case, their absence from the credit report is not affirmative evidence that the \ndebts have been resolved. According to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, in some cases, \nderogatory accounts may fall off of the credit reports after seven years. This does not \nmean that the debt is no longer owing. \nApplicant believes that financial management classes would be helpful to him. (Tr. \npp. 85 - 86. He realizes that his past poor decisions have negatively impacted his \nfinances. He testified that he has many close friends who are currently active duty \nmilitary, National Guard, Army Reserves and the like. He further testified that he would \nnever do anything, under any circumstances, to endanger their lives, or put his freedom \nor his country in danger. (Tr. pp. 25 - 26.) \nApplicant\u2019s performance appraisal for 2019 is favorable. It indicates that he has \n\u201cexceeded\u201d and/or \u201csubstantially achieved\u201d the expectations of the job in every category. \n(Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit A.) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18:      \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquencies dating back to at least 2013. In \nregard to his taxes, it appears that he has now filed his Federal income tax returns but \nhas been unable to pay his back taxes. His state tax returns in question have not been \nfiled nor have the taxes been paid or disputed. His other debt is still outstanding. In \n2013, Applicant took extraordinary steps when he decided to quit a good paying job and \ndedicated himself and his financial resources to obtaining custody of his children. At \nthat time, he had already accumulated significant debt. He knew that he would put \nhimself in financial jeopardy, and the consequences could be devastating. Today, he \nstill owes most of this debt and remains excessively indebted. There is insufficient \ninformation in the record to conclude that he is financially stable, or that he can afford \nhis lifestyle, or that he has the financial resources available to pay his financial \nobligations. Furthermore, there is no evidence in the record to show that any regular \nmonthly payments of any sort are being made toward his debts. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under Financial Considerations are potentially \napplicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent  or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAdmittedly, Applicant was confronted with a difficult and unexpected situation \nwhen his daughter ran away. This situation was beyond his control. However, the \ndrastic measures Applicant took by quitting his job, ignoring his tax return filings, and all \nof his financial responsibilities was irresponsible on many levels. The decision he made \ncaused his financial set back and his current financial situation. As a result, he is now \nsuffering the consequences. Furthermore, when he became employed, he did little in \nthe way of addressing his finances. Little progress if any has been made toward \nresolving his excessive indebtedness. \nApplicant only offers that he will pay the \naccounts when he can. Those debts that have fallen off of his credit report because \nthey are old, he believes he does not owe.

DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on \nNovember 9, 2020. \nFindings of Fact \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant had some outstanding tax filings and was behind on his mortgage The \nevidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant is current with his mortgage and with his tax filings. He attributes much \nof his delinquencies to his wife losing her job due to health reasons. Mitigation under \nAG \u00b6 20 has been established. Financial Considerations is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Applicant is well respected at his place of \nemployment (AppX B.) He performs well at his job. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c.:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s SOR response, she admitted her failure to file federal income tax returns for tax years 2013 through 2018. (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) Applicant\u2019s admission is accepted as a finding of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 64-year-old inbound contact representative employed by the same defense contractor since about June 2018. She received professional certifications as a medical coordinator and pharmacy technician in 1978 and 1980. Applicant has never been married, and she does not have any children. (Tr. 17-18, 20, 28; GE 1) Financial Considerations Applicant experienced tax issues with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) beginning in 2013 while employed in a position that required extensive travel. During this time she was often away from home, and she was not sleeping well. She misplaced some of the tax documents she needed to file her 2013 federal income tax return. She mistakenly believed she would be unable to file the following year as she was required to report the previous year\u2019s tax information. This belief persisted and she did not file her federal income tax returns for the next five years. During this time she also suffered from depression and anxiety, and after January 2015 the stress of being unemployed made her health issues worse. She did not have any medical insurance coverage, and she was unable to obtain treatment for her depression and anxiety",

In May 2021, \nDepartment Counsel requested a hearing pursuant to Paragraph E3.1.7. of the Additional \nProcedural Guidance at Enclosure 3 of DOD Directive 5220.6. On June 11, 2021, the \ncase was assigned to me. On July 1, 2021, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for July 22, 2021 using the U.S. \nCyber Command video teleconference system. The hearing was held as scheduled. \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered two Government exhibits (GE) 1 \nand 2; Applicant offered eight documents labeled as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A through H; \nand all proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence without objection. On August 3, \n2021, DOHA received a copy of the hearing transcript (Tr.). On August 4, 2021, Applicant \nsubmitted seven documents, (AE I through O); which were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. The record closed on August 11, 2021. (Tr. 15, 37, 48) \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, she admitted her failure to file federal income tax \nreturns for tax years 2013 through 2018. (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) Applicant\u2019s admission is accepted \nas a finding of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 64-year-old inbound contact representative employed by the same \ndefense contractor since about June 2018. She received professional certifications as a \nmedical coordinator and pharmacy technician in 1978 and 1980. Applicant has never \nbeen married, and she does not have any children. (Tr. 17-18, 20, 28; GE 1) \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant experienced tax issues with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) \nbeginning in 2013 while employed in a position that required extensive travel. During this \ntime she was often away from home, and she was not sleeping well. She misplaced some \nof the tax documents she needed to file her 2013 federal income tax return. She \nmistakenly believed she would be unable to file the following year as she was required to \nreport the previous year\u2019s tax information. This belief persisted and she did not file her \nfederal income tax returns for the next five years. During this time she also suffered from \ndepression and anxiety, and after January 2015 the stress of being unemployed made \nher health issues worse. She did not have any medical insurance coverage, and she was \nunable to obtain treatment for her depression and anxiety. (Tr. 18-19; GE 1) \nApplicant has a history of intermittent unemployment. She was unemployed from \nJanuary 2015 to March 2016. In March 2016, she found new employment in a seasonal \nposition that did not offer medical insurance. This seasonal employment ended in October \n2016, and she remained unemployed until May 2017 when she was hired by a nursing \n2 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \ncare facility. Her position with this employer ended in December 2017. She remained \nunemployed and uninsured until she was hired by her current employer in June 2018. (Tr. \n19-21; GE 1) \nIn approximately September 2018, Applicant suffered from a medical neurological \ncondition, somewhat similar to a stroke. She experienced problems with comprehension \nand retention of information for the following six-to-eight month period. She continued her \nemployment duties despite encountering these difficulties, which required her to take \nextensive notes to successfully complete her job tasks. During her recovery, she began \nto receive communications from the Government concerning her unfiled federal tax \nreturns. She realized it was an important issue she needed to address and fully resolve. \n(Tr. 21-22) \nIn January 2020, Applicant visited the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) office in an \neffort to determine how she could file all of her unfiled federal income tax returns. She \nwas told by an IRS representative that she did not owe any back taxes since she had \nsufficient taxes withheld from her income, and Applicant would most likely receive tax \nrefunds for certain tax years after the tax returns were filed. The IRS representative also \nstated that there were other refunds Applicant would not be entitled to receive since the \nstatute of limitations for refunds for those tax years had run. (Tr. 18-19, 21-23) \nAfter the tax meeting Applicant started the arduous process of obtaining tax \nrecords from her past employers\u2019 human resources offices. The process became even \nmore difficult with the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic and trying to obtain past payroll \nrecords and W-2 forms with employees working from their home offices, or in one \ninstance, a complete change in the payroll database. Eventually all of the documentation \nwas provided, and in April 2021, Applicant filed her 2013 through 2018 federal income \ntax returns. (Tr. 23-24; AE A, AE B, AE C, AE D, AE E, AE F, AE O) \nApplicant testified that she will always timely file her federal income tax returns in \nthe future. She provided documentation that she filed her 2019 and 2020 federal income \ntax returns and received tax refunds for both years. There is no requirement in her state \nof residence to file state income tax returns. She also initiated a new filing system to store \nall of her pertinent tax documents. Since her employment in June 2018, she has a medical \nprovider she regularly visits to treat her depression and anxiety, which played a major \nrole in her inability to file income tax returns over a long period of time. (Tr. 24-25, 27; AE \nG, AE H) \nCharacter Evidence \nApplicant provided post-hearing documentation from her current employer \nregarding an evaluation of her employment duties. In January 2019, January 2020, and \nJanuary 2021, she received \u201cexceptional\u201d employee performance ratings. Her most \nrecent work evaluation dated June 2021 showed that Applicant continued her job \nperformance in an outstanding manner.

Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). The Government\u2019s authority to restrict access to classified information \napplies similarly in the protection of sensitive, unclassified information. As Commander in \nChief, the President has the authority to control access to information bearing on national \nsecurity or other sensitive information and to determine whether an individual is \nsufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. See Id. at 527. \nThe standard that must be met for assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on \nall available information, the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that \nassigning the person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity. DOD contractor personnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in \nthe Directive before any final unfavorable access determination may be made.   \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, an \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. An administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial \nand commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard sensitive \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant which may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to sensitive information. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position. See ISCR Case No. 95-\n0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his or her [access to sensitive information].\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being \nconsidered for access to [sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national\nsecurity.\u201d Section 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of \nthe applicant concerned.\u201d \n \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the trustworthiness concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \ntrustworthiness concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation \nomitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might\nknowingly compromise [sensitive] information in order to raise money in\nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the\ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge\nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control,\njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as\nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances.

Her past employer required her to travel frequently, \nand in 2013 she was unable to file her federal tax return due to misplacement of pertinent \ntax documents. She also suffered from anxiety and depression, which surfaced from \nbeing away from home extensively and not sleeping well while traveling. In January 2015, \nshe became unemployed and her health conditions worsened since she did not have \nmedical insurance to obtain treatment. These are circumstances beyond her control that \nadversely affected Applicant\u2019s ability to timely file federal income tax returns. \nApplicant\u2019s tax situation was compromised by circumstances beyond her control. \nShe used good judgment by having sufficient taxes withheld from her income so that she \ndid not develop significant tax debt. In addition, she acted responsibly by attending a \nJanuary 2020 tax meeting with the IRS to resolve her tax issues, which was well before \nthe issuance of the SOR in August 2020. Her filing of all federal tax returns, to include tax \nyears 2019 and 2020, shows her overall sensible conduct and trustworthiness. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(b), and 20(g) apply. I find that Applicant resolved all tax issues and is committed to \nfiling all future tax returns in a timely manner. She also provided convincing employment \ncharacter evidence that showed she is reliable and steadfast in the performance of her \njob duties. Her efforts are sufficient to mitigate financial considerations trustworthiness \nconcerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to sensitive information by considering the totality of the \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n6 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant access to a \npublic trust position and access to sensitive information \u201cmust be an overall \ncommonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines\u201d and the \nwhole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline \nbut some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 64-year-old inbound contact representative employed by the same \ndefense contractor since about June 2018. Due to circumstances beyond her control, she \nfailed to timely file federal income tax returns for 2013-2018. She took responsible action \nby visiting the IRS to resolve her unfiled taxes well before she received the SOR in August \n2020.

The CAF issued an SOR to Applicant in 2013 (2013 \nSOR) alleging security concerns under Guidelines F and E (Financial Considerations and \nPersonal Conduct).

These allegations in the 2013 SOR relate to Applicant\u2019s failure to file his \nfederal and state tax returns for tax years (TYs) 2009-2011, his failure to pay his federal \nand state taxes in TYs 2009-2012, and his failure to pay a student loan. (GE 8 at 3, 5.) \nThe details of each of the allegations in the 2019 SOR are as follows: \nSOR Allegations \n1.a Failure to file and/or pay Federal income taxes in TYs 2008-2016 \u2013 \nApplicant testified that he has filed all of his Federal tax returns for the years alleged. He \nsubmitted the returns to the IRS on his own without professional help. He hired a tax firm \nto file his 2017 return, which it did. The tax firm was supposed to review his tax returns \nfor the prior years and file amendments to reduce his taxes, if appropriate. The firm never \ndid that, and he stopped working with them. At the time he filed his Federal returns, he \nhad not paid all of the taxes he owes. He has not made any payments to the IRS since \nthen, other than through a bankruptcy proceeding for about two years in the 2013\u20132015 \nperiod, as discussed below. (Tr. at 25-42, 51; AE A at 2.) \nThe CAF sent Applicant interrogatories asking him to provide his IRS Account \nTranscripts for TYs 2008-2017. He provided with his responses, dated in March 2019, \nsummary account information only for the TYs 2009, 2012, and 2014. He provided wage \nand income transcripts, which do not contain the relevant information, for TY 2010. The \nIRS records reflect that he failed to file his tax return in 2009 and filed late in 2012 and \n2014. The IRS summary account records also reflect that Applicant owes taxes for each \nof these three years, $11,100 (TY 2009), $408 (TY 2012), and $4,778 (TY 2014). (GE 6 \nat 3, 15, 21-23, 26-30, 32-37, 40-42, 45-52.) \nAs of the date of the hearing, Applicant had no idea how much he owes the IRS \nfor past-due taxes. In September 2020, over one year after he received the SOR, he hired \na second tax firm to help him sort out his tax liabilities and to file his 2020 tax return, as \nwell as his returns for TY 2018 and 2019. He has not yet filed those returns. The new firm \nis also supposed to create an installment payment plan for Applicant to pay his unpaid \ntaxes. As of the close of the record, that had not happened. (Tr. at 25-42, 51-51; AE A at \n2 .) \n1.b Failure to file and/or pay state income taxes in TYs 2008-2015 \u2013 Applicant \ntestified that he timely filed all of his state tax returns for TYs 2008-2015 when he filed his \nFederal returns. He testified that he has also filed his returns for TYs 2016 and 2017. He \nprovided no documents evidencing the filings or when the returns were filed. As of the \nhearing date, he had not filed his state tax returns for TYs 2018-2020. As noted, he has \nhired a new tax advisor to file these returns and to review his old returns. In his Answer, \nApplicant admitted that he has not paid all of his state taxes for TY 2008 to 2015.

The first one was \nfiled in December 2010 in the amount of $3,250. The Government\u2019s September 2016 \ncredit report, GE 5, reflects that this lien was paid in July 2012. It likely covers tax \ndeficiencies for TY 2009 or earlier. Applicant incorrectly wrote in his responses to the \nCAF\u2019s interrogatories that this lien was for his 2016 taxes, which post-dates the filing date \nof the lien. A second lien was filed on July 18, 2017, in the amount of $9,067. Applicant \nbelieves that this lien covers all the tax years prior to 2015. Applicant wrote in his \ninterrogatory responses that the state first garnished his wages in August 2018 in the \namount of $597 per month, but the amount was later reduced to $125 per month. He \ntestified that this garnishment has ended and the lien was paid off in 2020. The state has \nissued another garnishment, and likely a third tax lien, which is not in the record, for taxes \nowed in TY 2018 and 2019. The state takes about $300 per month from Applicant\u2019s wages \nunder this garnishment. Applicant is unaware of the amount of his current tax debt, but \nhe estimates that the total amount of the garnishment is about $10,000. The garnishment \nwill end in three years. Applicant has paid and is paying his state tax deficiencies since \nTY 2008 through involuntary garnishments. Even as recently as 2019, he has not paid \nhis state taxes, as required. (Tr. at 42-51; GE 5 at 3; AE A at 2; AE F.) \n1.c June 2013 Chapter 13 bankruptcy, converted to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy and \ndischarged in November 2015 \u2013 Applicant filed a petition for bankruptcy under Chapter \n13 on June 28, 2013, in which he sought to pay his delinquent Federal and state taxes \nthrough his bankruptcy repayment plan over five years. He listed on Schedule E his \nunsecured priority claims, which consisted of Federal tax debts of $11,641 for TY 2010, \n$9,770 for TY 2011, and $5,270 for TY 2012, totaling $26,682. He also listed state tax \ndebts of $1,930 for TY 2010, $1,998 for TY 2011, and $1,894 for TY 2012, totaling $5,822. \nOn Schedule F, he listed two student loans, one for about $10,610 and a second one for \n$114. Four months earlier, the DoD issued the 2013 SOR in which it alleged that Applicant \nowed past-due Federal taxes for TY 2009-2012 in the total amount of $41,802 and state \ntaxes for TY 2009-2012 in the total amount of about $6,668. Applicant admitted each of \nthese debts in the earlier DOHA proceeding. (Tr. at 51-53; GE 7 at 15, 19; GE 8 at 5.) \n \nThe Bankruptcy Court approved Applicant\u2019s Chapter 13 repayment plan on August \n21, 2013. In his September 20, 2013 decision, the DOHA Administrative Judge granted \nApplicant\u2019s security clearance renewal application under the then applicable adjudicative \nguidelines, writing that: \u201cApplicant has submitted substantial evidence to show that he \nhas filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which will repay all of his past-due debts in full within \nfive years . . . . Applicant has made arrangements to pay his tax indebtedness through \nhis bankruptcy plan.\u201d He concluded his decision with the comment that: \u201cApplicant has \nhad financial problems for several years, which are now being resolved. He currently \nshows good judgment with regard to his debt. In my opinion, he will continue to exercise \nsuch judgment in the future.\u201d (GE 7 at 2; GE 8 at 8-10.) \nOn December 13, 2013, Applicant\u2019s employer was ordered under the Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy plan to deduct the payments from Applicant\u2019s wages and forward the \npayments to the Trustee for further distribution to Applicant\u2019s creditors.

(Tr. at 52-53; GE 7 at 1, 4.) \nLess than two years into the five-year repayment plan, Applicant converted his \nChapter 13 bankruptcy to Chapter 7 on August 27, 2015. Under Chapter 7, Applicant \nobtained a discharge on November 24, 2015, of his unsecured non-priority debts totaling \n$62,819, less his student loans, which were not discharged. His past-due taxes were also \nnot discharged, though a portion of them may have been reduced by his payments under \nhis Chapter 13 plan during the period from December 2013 to August 2015. After the \nconversion of the bankruptcy proceeding to Chapter 7, Applicant asked his tax advisor to \nhelp set up a payment plan with the IRS. That did not happen. Applicant has never been \nable to determine how much his Federal tax debt was reduced by his Chapter 13 \npayments. The limited IRS tax account records Applicant submitted to the CAF reflect five \npayments made through the bankruptcy proceeding during the period March 2015-June \n2015 totaling $5,302. (Tr. at 52-53; GE 7 at 1, 4.) \nApplicant chose to convert his Chapter 13 bankruptcy to Chapter 7 because he left \nhis employment by mutual agreement with the employer. His bankruptcy attorney advised \nhim to make the conversion because it was uncertain when he would find new \nemployment and be able to continue making his Chapter 13 payments. (Tr. at 53-60.) \n1.d Charged-off credit-card account in the amount of about $710 \u2013 Applicant \nopened this account in February 2016 and defaulted on it in August 2016. He is not aware \nof this account. Applicant suggested that due to a data breach of his credit at Equifax, this \naccount might be the result of identity theft. He has done nothing to resolve his concern \nabout the legitimacy of this debt, and if legitimate, to resolve it. (Tr. at 61-66, 76-78; AE A \nat 2; GE 3 at 3; GE 4 at 2 .) \n1.e Student loan account in collection in the amount of about $10,792 \u2013 \nApplicant\u2019s student loan account was opened in 2003. It became delinquent in about \n2016. When Applicant started his master\u2019s program, payments on this loan were deferred \nfor about six months. He has been making payments of about $65 per month since then. \nHis current balance is about $6,000. This account is being resolved. (Answer; Tr. at 60-\n61, 66-73; GE 3 at 2-3; GE 4 at 3; GE 5 at 10, 11; AE E; AE G.) \nApplicant testified that he received financial counseling through his bank as well \nas the mandatory financial counseling required when filing for bankruptcy. He said that \nhe prepared a budget and used it for a period. He learned that he should stop buying \nthings that he could not afford. He did not provide any further details.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAdverse clearance determinations must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication \nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \n6 \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n\n \n \n \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nThe Government\u2019s credit reports listing 18 delinquent debts establish the following \nconditions under AG \u00b6 19 that could be disqualifying: \n(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(d): failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local. Income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 20 contains seven conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Six of these mitigating conditions have possible \napplicability to the facts of this case: \n(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \ntaken to resolve the issue; and \n(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s federal and state tax debts span many \nyears and remain outstanding. They occurred under circumstances that are likely to recur. \nApplicant\u2019s behavior casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is only partially established. Applicant\u2019s financial problems arose in part \ndue to his PTSD and related depression. He has not been able to materially change his \nbehavior with medical intervention, and he has not acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances by effectively working with tax professionals to help him resolve his tax \nfiling and paying issues, which date back to at least 2009. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is only partially established. Applicant received financial counseling and \nthe assistance of two tax professionals. There are no clear indications, however, that this \ncounseling has helped him resolve his tax issues. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is only partially established. Applicant initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay his student loan. He is resolving his state tax debts through involuntary \ngarnishments of his wages, which has limited mitigation value under this mitigating \ncondition. He has not, however, entered into a payment plan with the IRS even though \nhe has had the financial means to do so for several years. His decision to convert his \nChapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding to a Chapter 7 proceeding had the effect of avoiding \nhis obligations to all of his pre-2013 non-priority creditors, i.e., all of his creditors holding \nconsumer debts. In addition, he did not honor his implicit 2013 commitment made to, and \nrelied upon by, the DOHA administrative judge that he would repay all of his creditors with \nhis Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant disputes the credit-card debt alleged in \n1.d, but he has taken no actions to dispute the debt with the collection agency, nor has \nhe submitted any documentation in support of the legitimacy of the dispute and his efforts \nto resolve it. \nAG 20(g) is only partially established. There is limited documentary evidence in \nthe record establishing that Applicant has filed two Federal tax returns, one for TY 2012 \nand the other for TY 2014. There is also the 2013 DOHA decision in which the \nAdministrative Judge found that Applicant had filed his Federal tax returns for TYs 2009-\n2011. The Judge found that Applicant filed the first two returns late. Under the \ncircumstances, I find Applicant\u2019s testimony credible that he filed his other Federal and \nstate tax returns during the 2008-2016 period, timely or otherwise. As noted, Applicant \nhas not, however, made any arrangements with the IRS to pay his past-due Federal taxes \nfor that period. Applicant candidly admits that he does not  know how much he owes the \nIRS. He is paying or has paid his past-due state taxes involuntarily through the legal \nprocess of garnishment. The state initiated that process by filing liens and garnishments. \nApplicant has no choice but to receive reduced wages due to the state\u2019s garnishments.  \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances, and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have given great weight to Applicant\u2019s \n21 years of military service and to his service-related disability. His condition deserves \nsignificant empathy from everyone in his life, which includes me as the Administrative \nJudge assigned to adjudicate his security clearance eligibility. His condition, however, \ndoes not qualify as a mitigating condition under the applicable adjudicative guidelines. To \nbe eligible to be granted access to classified information, Applicant must demonstrate \nthat he is capable of fulfilling his duties and obligations to his country, which include filing \nand paying his taxes, as required. Applicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation falls short of meeting \nthat standard, which is expected of every U.S. citizen. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence as described above leaves me with questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. After weighing \nthe applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all of the evidence \nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by his financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interests of the United \nStates to grant Applicant national security eligibility for a security clearance.

The SOR also alleged that Applicant\u2019s two brothers are Iraqi citizens residing in the \nUnited States (SOR 1.c), and that his sister is an Iraqi citizen living in the Czech Republic \n(SOR 1.d). \nAdditionally, it was alleged that Applicant\u2019s father-in-law is an Iraqi citizen living in \nIraq and working as an Iraqi government official (SOR 1.e); that one of his four sisters-in-\nlaw is an Iraqi citizen who works as an Iraqi government official assigned to the Iraqi \nEmbassy in the United States (SOR 1.f); that one of Applicant\u2019s brothers-in-law is an Iraqi \ncitizen living in Iraq and serving as an officer in the Iraqi Ministry of Interior (SOR 1.g); \nand that another brother-in-law is an Iraqi citizen living in Iraq and serving as a non\u00ad\ncommissioned officer (NCO) in an Iraqi counterterrorism unit (SOR 1.h). \nFinally, the SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s friend is a citizen of Yemen and is the \nYemeni ambassador to the United States (SOR 1.i); that Applicant\u2019s cousin is an Iraqi \ncitizen living in Oman, and that he once was an Iraqi Army chief executive officer (SOR \n1.j); and that Applicant has three other sisters-in-law are Iraqi citizens living in Iraq, the \nUnited Arab Emirates (UAE), and the Netherlands (SOR 1.k). \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant is 40 years old.

(Tr. 9 \u2013 10) \nIn addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \nIn Iraq, Applicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in an information technology field in \n2003. Between 2004 and 2011, he was employed by a series of U.S. companies and non\u00ad\ngovernmental organizations (NGOs) working in Iraq in support of U.S. post-invasion \nefforts there. Between January 2009 and his departure from Iraq in January 2011, \nApplicant worked for U.S. contractors doing business in support of the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development (USAID). During that time, he was screened on multiple \noccasions by U.S. counterintelligence personnel for access to the International Zone (IZ) \nin Baghdad. His work in support of USAID and other American interests qualified him to \napply for SIVs for him and his family. He began the application process in 2008. (Answer; \nGX 1 \u2013 3; AX K; AX L; Tr. 22 \u2013 26, 39) \nAfter arriving in the United States, Applicant found work as a linguist, cultural \nadvisor, and role player with federal contractors supporting U.S. military training efforts \nfor the ongoing mission in Iraq. His work has frequently required that he have access to \nmilitary facilities across the United States. In March 2017, Applicant was hired by his \ncurrent employer, who is sponsoring his request for a security clearance. It is anticipated \nthat Applicant will work overseas in this position. In May 2017, Applicant completed a \nmilitary counter-intelligence screening process in preparation for his work overseas. \nDuring that process, Applicant submitted a detailed list of all of his foreign contacts, most \nof whom are immediate and extended family members living in Iraq, the United States, \nand elsewhere. That list included the nature of his relationship with those people, their \noccupations, the frequency of his contact with those people and the last time he had \ncontact with any of them. In response to government interrogatories in 2019, he submitted \nan updated version of that list. (GX 1 \u2013 3; AX K) \nApplicant\u2019s parents are citizens of Iraq; however, they are now living in the UK. His \nmother is a naturalized British citizen and his father is a permanent resident alien in the \nUK. Applicant is in regular contact with them because both are elderly and have medical \nchallenges. Applicant has not seen either of his parents in person since 2018, when they \nvisited him in the United States.

One of his brothers lives in the \nUnited States as a naturalized U.S. citizen. Another brother lives in Canada. He is married \nto an Iraqi citizen, Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law referenced in SOR 1.f. Until recently, she \nworked as an Iraqi diplomatic official at Iraq\u2019s embassy in Washington D.C. Both \nApplicant\u2019s brother and sister-in-law are living in Canada, where they were recently \ngranted political asylum. (GX 1 \u2013 3; AX P; AX Q; Tr. 30, 45 \u2013 47, 59) \nApplicant has one sister. As alleged in SOR 1.d, she is still an Iraqi citizen, but now \nlives in the Czech Republic as a permanent resident alien there. Applicant last saw his \nsister in 2011. (GX 1 \u2013 3; Tr. 31) \nAs alleged in SOR 1.e, Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s father is an Iraqi citizen and still lives in \nIraq. He is an Iraqi government official working in the transportation ministry. Applicant\u2019s \nwife\u2019s two brothers are both Iraqi citizens living and working in Iraq. One is an officer in \nthe Iraqi interior ministry (SOR 1.g) and one is an NCO in an Iraqi counterterrorism unit \n(SOR 1.h). Applicant has had no direct contact with his father-in-law or either of his \nbrothers-in-law since 2018. Applicant\u2019s wife also has three sisters who are Iraqi citizens \n(SOR 1.k). One still lives in Iraq, one lives in the Netherlands, and one lives in the United \nArab Emirates. Applicant last had direct contact with his sisters-in-law in 2011. Applicant\u2019s \nwife has occasional contact with her father and siblings; however, Applicant does not ask \nabout those conversations. (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 3; Tr. 31 \u2013 35, 47 \u2013 48, 57) \nApplicant also has a cousin who is an Iraqi citizen living in Oman. When Applicant \ndisclosed this contact in 2017, his cousin was a senior Iraqi Army officer; however, \nApplicant does not know if his cousin is still in the military and, if so, what his current rank \nis. Applicant has not had any contact with his cousin since 2016. Before 2016, contact \nwith his cousin was limited, at most. (GX 1 \u2013 3; Tr. 36, 48) \nApplicant has a friend who is a citizen of Yemen and, until December 2020, served \nas the Yemeni ambassador to the United States. He is currently Yemen\u2019s foreign minister. \nBefore becoming an ambassador, he was active in government reform efforts; however, \nin the early days of protests underlying the current civil war, he was kidnapped by anti-\ngovernment forces seeking leverage in negotiations with the Yemen government. \nApplicant first met this person in the 1990s, when the future ambassador and a friend of \nApplicant\u2019s sister started dating while in college. Applicant last was in contact with the \nambassador in 2018 in connection with a visit to the United States by Applicant\u2019s parents. \nBefore that visit, Applicant had not had any contact with the ambassador since the late \n1990s or early 2000s. In 2018, the ambassador hosted a social event at his residence for \nApplicant\u2019s parents on the occasion of their visit to see Applicant. Applicant also saw the \nambassador during his parents\u2019 visit when he took his father to visit the ambassador at \nthe Yemeni embassy. He has not had any contact with the ambassador since then. (GX \n1 \u2013 3; GX 6; Tr. 33 \u2013 34, 37 \u2013 39, 48) \nBefore Applicant emigrated from Iraq, and while he was working in support of \nUSAID and other American interests, Applicant was threatened with physical violence by \n4 \n\n \nanti-U.S. insurgents. In 2004, he was seen witnessing acts of violence directed at Iraqis \nwho had voted in the country\u2019s first democratic election. Insurgents approached him and \nthreatened to kill him if he continued to watch what was happening. On another occasion, \nApplicant became aware that he was on a list for possible assassination simply because \nhe had been observed entering the IZ using U.S.-issued credentials.

Applicant does not discuss the substance of his work as a role player with his \nwife; however, she knows that he works with the U.S. military and that he may work \noverseas should he receive a security clearance. Applicant has not discussed his \ndefense-related work with anyone else in his family or his wife\u2019s family. As far as they are \nconcerned, he is a taxi driver in the United States. (GX 3; AX H; Tr. 52 \u2013 55) \nSince 2018, Applicant has had no contact with any Iraqi relatives other than his \nparents. Because of their advanced age and health concerns, Applicant contacts them by \nphone or social media every week. Because of the counter-intelligence screening, and \nafter receiving the SOR, Applicant decided to cut off contact with the rest of his relatives \nand his wife\u2019s relatives. For that reason, Applicant was unable to provide current \ninformation about his foreign relatives and associates in response to questioning at the \nhearing. (Tr. 57 \u2013 59, 61 \u2013 62) \nTo properly assess the security significance of these facts within the adjudicative \nguideline at issue, I have taken administrative notice of certain facts regarding Iraq and \nYemen as presented in GX 4 and 5. As to Iraq, of particular note is the continued inability \nof its freely elected government to quell the violence and instability that persist in parts of \nIraq. These conditions are fueled and perpetrated by terrorist groups affiliated with Al-\nQaeda and ISIS, as well as by Sunni insurgents and Iranian-backed Shiite militias. As a \nresult, some parts of Iraq remain wholly unstable. Even the city of Baghdad is still subject \nto random acts of terrorist violence. (GX 4) \nU.S. citizens and interests in Iraq remain at high risk for kidnapping and terrorist \nviolence. The U.S. State Department has advised against all individual travel to Iraq. The \nability of the U.S. Embassy to provide consular services to U.S. citizens outside Baghdad \nand the southern city of Basra is extremely limited given the security environment. ISIS \nagain controls significant portions of Iraq\u2019s territory, and numerous other terrorist and \ninsurgent groups are active in Iraq. Such groups regularly attack both Iraqi security forces \nand civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias may also threaten U.S. citizens and western \ncompanies throughout Iraq. U.S. Government and western interests remain possible \ntargets for attacks. Additionally, there are significant human-rights problems in Iraq. \nWidespread corruption, as well as abuses by Iraqi security forces in response to acts of \nviolence by terrorists and others, have undermined confidence in the Iraqi government \nand its judiciary. Human-rights violations by Iraqi law enforcement are not uncommon and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nare not being addressed when identified.

The various terrorist and militia organizations are also responsible for \nsignificant human rights abuses in Iraq. (GX 4) \nYemen achieved total independence in 1990 through the unification of North \nYemen, a 1918 vestige of the Ottoman Empire that became the Yemen Arab Republic in \n1962, and South Yemen, previously the People\u2019s Republic of Southern Yemen until 1967, \nwhen the British withdrew. As to risk assessment, the Government\u2019s information shows \nthat Yemen has been in a state of civil war since 2015 between the Yemen government \nand Houthi rebels. Much of the fighting is supported by a U.S. \u2013 Saudi coalition on the \nside of government forces, and by Iran on the side of the Houthis. The results have been \ncatastrophic for Yemen. Iranian-backed terror organizations \u2013 notably, Al-Quaida on the \nArabian Peninsula (AQAP), ISIS \u2013 Yemen Hezbollah (IYH), and Islamic Revolutionary \nGuard Force \u2013 Qods Force (IRGC-QF) \u2013 have taken advantage of the inability of the \nYemen government to maintain order or provide basic government services to embark on \nnumerous terror campaigns in much of the country. Famine and a complete lack of human \nrights are the norm in much of Yemen. The U.S. State Department has issued a Level 4 \n(Do Not Travel) warning advising Americans not to travel to Yemen. Because Yemen\u2019s \ngovernment cannot satisfactorily screen persons traveling from Yemen to the United \nStates, Yemenis are not eligible for the U.S. Visa Waiver Program, an indication of the \nU.S. government\u2019s concerns about the possible export of international terrorism from \nYemen to the United States. (GX 5) \nApplicant is loyal to the United States and expressed pride in the work he has done \nfor the U.S. military and in support of U.S. interests in Iraq. Persons with whom Applicant \nhas worked in both capacities recommend him for access to sensitive information based \non their observations of his hard work, honesty, reliability, and trustworthiness in sensitive \ncircumstances. All of his personal and financial assets are in this country. Applicant does \nnot provide financial support to anyone outside of the United States. He is registered to \nvote in the United States and he meets all of his income tax reporting obligations as \nrequired. (Answer; AX G \u2013 N; Tr. 36 \u2013 37) \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; see also AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988)) \nAnalysis \nForeign Influence \nThe security concern under this guideline is stated at AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest.

Applicant has both close and casual \nties to citizens of Iraq and Yemen residing in Iraq, the United States, Canada, and \nelsewhere. This information reasonably raises the security concern expressed at AG \u00b6 6. \nIn examining these facts more specifically, the concerns about Applicant\u2019s parents \nand his siblings are not disqualifying, as they have no continuing ties in Iraq. His parents \nreside in Great Britain, are elderly, and have no ongoing ties to Iraq. His mother is now a \nBritish citizen and his father is a permanent resident alien there. One of Applicant\u2019s \nbrothers is now a U.S. citizen and resident. His other brother, whose wife is a former Iraqi \ndiplomatic official, were recently granted political asylum in Canada, a status that militates \nagainst any continued connection in or with Iraq. Finally, Applicant has had little or no \ncontact with his sister, who has permanent resident status in the Czech Republic and is \nunlikely to return to Iraq. \n \nAs to Applicant\u2019s relationship with the former Yemen ambassador to the United \nStates, Applicant knows him only by way of his sister, to whose friend the ambassador is \nmarried, and by way of Applicant\u2019s father. This would carry some security significance if \nApplicant himself had been in ongoing contact with the ambassador. However, Applicant \nhad not had contact with the ambassador between the late 1990s and 2018, when \nApplicant\u2019s parents visited him in the United States. There also has been no ongoing \ncommunication or contact between Applicant and the ambassador since 2018. Although \nthe circumstances in Yemen certainly present a heightened risk of pressure or coercion, \navailable information shows that Applicant does not have any contact with Yemen that \nwould give rise to such risks. \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with his cousin in Oman and his wife\u2019s sisters in the \nNetherlands and the UAE do not present unacceptable security risks. Applicant last had \ncontact with his cousin in 2016, and his contact before then was sporadic. Additionally, \nthere is nothing in the record to suggest that Oman presents a heightened risk. Likewise, \nhe has no direct contact with two of his sisters-in-law living in countries not associated \nwith any heightened risk of pressure or coercion. \nThe allegations at SOR 1.a \u2013 1.d, 1.f, 1.i, and 1.j are resolved for Applicant. SOR \n1.k might be resolved for Applicant were it not for the inclusion of a sister-in-law in Iraq in \nthat allegation. \nThe allegations regarding Applicant\u2019s ties to his wife\u2019s family in Iraq (SOR 1.e, 1.g, \n1.h, and 1.k) remain unresolved. His wife\u2019s father and two brothers are government \nofficials in Iraq. Also, one of her sisters still lives in Iraq. Although Applicant may not have \ndirect contact with his in-laws, there is a rebuttable presumption that because his wife is \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclose to her father and siblings, he also has a close relationship with them. Applicant did \nnot present information that would rebut that presumption. The closeness of those \nrelationships remains a concern because they reside in Iraq, a country that presents a \nheightened risk of pressure or coercion. Additionally, the fact that his father-in-law and \nhis two brothers-in-law are government officials in Iraq adds to the weight of his burden \nof persuasion in mitigating the Government\u2019s security concerns. \nWith respect to SOR 1.e, 1.g, and 1.h, all of the foregoing requires application of \nthe following AG \u00b6 7 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nBy contrast, I have considered the following pertinent AG \u00b6 8 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nThese mitigating conditions can only be applied to SOR 1.a \u2013 1.d, 1.f, 1.i, and 1.j. \nThe remaining allegations have not been mitigated. It has not been shown that Applicant\u2019s \nwife is somehow not close to her relatives in Iraq. Accordingly, Applicant is presumed to \nhave close relationships with his in-laws in Iraq, three of whom are government officials \nthere. While the Iraqi government itself might not act to pressure or coerce those contacts, \nthe instability and lack of respect for civil liberties engendered by Iraq\u2019s inability to stabilize \nits internal affairs poses a real threat to U.S. persons and interests there.

Although his \nsense of loyalty to the United States is significant, that information is not sufficient to \noutweigh the heightened risk of coercion presented by the presence of his wife\u2019s family \nin Iraq. I conclude none of the AG \u00b6 8 factors can be applied to SOR 1.e, 1.g, 1.h, and \n1.k. The security concerns about foreign influence are not mitigated. \nI also evaluated this record in the context of the whole-person factors listed in AG \n\u00b6 2(d). It cannot be disputed that Applicant is a loyal American citizen and is dedicated to \nhis work in support of U.S. interests. In the context of assessing an individual\u2019s suitability \nfor access to classified information, however, his circumstances must be examined with \nthe protection of the national interest in mind. This decision is a recognition of the \nheightened risks associated with Applicant\u2019s close ties of affection for persons who are \ngovernment officials in a country known, in this case, to present a real danger to those \npersons from groups seeking to harm U.S. interests. The state of affairs in Iraq and \nApplicant\u2019s personal ties in that country sustain doubts about the suitability of granting \nhim access to classified information. Because protection of the interests of national \nsecurity is the principal focus of these adjudications, those doubts must be resolved \nagainst the Applicant\u2019s request for clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d, 1.f, 1.i, 1.j:  \nSubparagraphs 1.e, 1.g, 1.h: \n AGAINST APPLICANT \n For Applicant \n  Against Applicant \nConclusion \nMATTHEW E.

On \nMay 9, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) \nsent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F \n(Financial Considerations).

DOHA received the hearing transcript on November 23, 2020. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 44-year-old engineer for a defense contractor, employed since 2004. \nApplicant earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2003 and has some credits toward a master\u2019s \ndegree. He served in the U.S. Air Force from 1995 to 1999, when he was honorably \ndischarged. Applicant is not currently married and has no children. He was previously \nmarried and divorced from 1994 to 1999, and 2012 to 2014. Applicant has had security \neligibility since 2006. \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant owes approximately $58,516 in \n14 delinquent debts and a home foreclosure in 2015. Applicant admitted the SOR \nallegations, and provided explanations and documentation with his Answer. \nApplicant began accumulating debts in 2013. He feared layoffs at his work would \naffect him, so he began to save money instead of paying debts and expenses. He accrued \ncredit cards and increasing debt and living beyond his means. (GE 2) He lived in a home \nthat he could not afford, and his income fell short of his expenses. Applicant also admits \nto irresponsible financial decisions with his home, credit cards, loans, and vehicles. \nApplicant allowed his debts to accumulate because of their \u201cenormity.\u201d In 2014, Applicant \ndivorced. He consulted an attorney to file a petition in bankruptcy and paid him $3,000. \nHe was advised however, that his income was too high to qualify for a Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy. Applicant declined to file a Chapter 13 because it was \u201cnot within his goals.\u201d \nApplicant defaulted on his mortgage and in 2015, his home mortgage was \nforeclosed and the property was reclaimed to satisfy the debt. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) Applicant has \nbeen paying on bank or credit card collection accounts alleged as SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.m \nafter judicial action was taken to obtain a judgment for the accounts. He also obtained \nsettlement offers on bank collection accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.o, however, he \nhas not made payments on the settlements as of the hearing date. The remaining SOR \ndebts are unpaid and Applicant has not taken action to resolve them. \nApplicant intends to address a charged off car loan that was reduced to judgment \nin 2017 and 2019. The creditor offered to accept two lump-sum payments, and Applicant \nintends to address this debt next. He also owes the IRS $5,728 for unpaid Federal taxes \nfrom 2017 and 2019, and was to begin paying $1,000 per month beginning in November \n2020. Applicant claimed that he has already paid off IRS debts for 2017 and 2018 through \na payment plan.

He has not changed his employment withholding to \naddress his end-of-year tax obligations. \nApplicant expressed a personal preference to keep cash rather than pay debts or \nthe IRS. He obtained a $30,000 loan against his 401K retirement plan in 2017. He used \nabout $15,000 to put a down payment on a vehicle, and used about $15,000 for vacations. \nApplicant earns about $100,000 per year, and he currently has savings of about $15,500. \nApplicant considers his savings to be for emergencies, not to pay debts. He has not \nsought financial counseling. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nare sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(b), and (c). Applicant \nadmitted to failing to pay Federal income taxes when required, however it was not alleged \nin the SOR. Therefore, I will only consider it when evaluating (a) Applicant\u2019s credibility; \n(b) to evaluate his evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether he has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a \nparticular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence \nfor whole-person analysis.

His financial problems have been longstanding and remain a recent and \nconcern. A debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent \nbecause \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct \nand, therefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating \nconditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \nApplicant\u2018s second divorce may have contributed to his debts, but he began \naccumulating them for fear of a job loss prior to his divorce. He has remained employed \nsince 2004, and earns a substantial income. However, he has not shown a willingness to \naddress his debts in a responsible and timely manner. Despite resolution of some of his \ndebts, and payments toward his IRS debt, I am not convinced he has acted responsibly \nand is willing to do so in the future. A majority of his debts have been ignored and remain \ndelinquent, despite available funds from a 401k loan and savings. \nApplicant has not sought help from a financial counselor, and seems satisfied to \nallow debts to become delinquent. His financial condition is not under control and will \nlikely continue. No mitigating condition fully applies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s employment status, divorces, tax status, and military service. I remain \nunconvinced of his overall financial responsibility and ability, intent, and desire to meet \nhis financial obligations in the future. \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interest of the United States to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n  Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.h, 1.j \u2013 1.l, 1.n \u2013 1.o:  \nAgainst Applicant \n  Subparagraphs 1.i and 1.m: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant   \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

I received the transcript (Tr.) on April 19, 2021, and the \nrecord closed. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 36 years old and married. He and his wife have a 15-year-old daughter, \na 4-year-old son, and 19-month-old son. He received his General Education Development \n(GED) in May 2002, and subsequently completed one semester\u2019s worth of community \ncollege classes. He has worked for defense contractors almost continuously since \nSeptember 2006. Throughout this time, he has also worked second jobs at restaurants \nand at a nightclub. Since March 2020, Applicant has worked as a property manager and \nequipment specialist for his current employer. He first applied for a secret security \nclearance in 2012 and has continuously held classified access since 2012. He completed \nhis second SCA in January 2018. (GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 12-14, 21-29, 80) \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. He first used marijuana in 1995, at \nthe age of ten, when his mother introduced it to him, and used marijuana at the age of 16 \nfor six months. Starting in 2003, when he was 18, Applicant used marijuana three to four \ntimes a month. He stopped using marijuana from 2009 to 2012, when he worked for a \ndefense contractor that conducted random drug tests. At the hearing, he admitted that he \ndiscontinued using marijuana during this period, because he was fearful of losing his job. \n(GE 2; Tr. 48-50, 54, 59, 67-69) \nIn 2012, Applicant completed a SCA for employment with a new company. This \ndefense contractor required a pre-employment drug test, but it did not conduct random \ndrug testing of its employees. Applicant knew that it was against his employer\u2019s policy to \nuse drugs, including marijuana, and he was aware that marijuana use could adversely \naffect his employment and security clearance status. In his 2012 SCA, Applicant did not \ndisclose his history of marijuana use, despite using marijuana during the previous seven \nyears. This issue was not alleged in the LOI; therefore, it is not disqualifying behavior, but \nit will be considered within the Guideline E mitigation analysis and whole-person analysis. \n(GE 1; GE 2 at 4-5, 23; Tr. 48-50, 54, 59-61, 67-69) \nAfter his pre-employment drug test in 2012, Applicant resumed using and \npurchasing marijuana. In his September 2018 background interview, he admitted that he \nused marijuana daily after work from 2012 until November 2015. At the hearing, he initially \nclaimed that he \u201cmay have done it a couple of times, like on occasions from what [he \ncould] remember.\u201d He eventually admitted that the information he told the background \ninvestigator regarding his marijuana use was accurate. (GE 2 at 4-5; Tr. 60) \nStarting in November 2014, Applicant worked as a bouncer at a nightclub. After \nleaving work at the nightclub on a Sunday night in November 2015, Applicant was pulled \nover by the police, because his license-plate light was out. The police officer smelled \nmarijuana coming from his vehicle and asked Applicant if he possessed marijuana. \nApplicant affirmatively answered, and the police seized a small bag of marijuana from his \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npants pocket and three-ounce bag of marijuana from his gym bag. At the hearing, he \nadmitted that he purchased the three-ounce bag from a coworker that night, and he used \nmarijuana prior to the traffic stop. Applicant planned to give some of the marijuana to his \nmother-in-law, but the remainder was for his personal use. (GE 2 at 3; Tr. 32-34, 48-50, \n54, 59, 67-69, 71-72) \nThe police officer who detained Applicant, told him to call a specific police \ninvestigator the next day. Applicant was then released, he was not taken into custody or \narrested. Applicant called the police investigator, who wanted him to provide information \nas to where he obtained the marijuana. Additionally, the investigator wanted him to go \nundercover to help the police conduct a sting operation. Applicant refused to name his \ndealer or provide additional assistance, as he did not want to get \u201cinvolved.\u201d (GE 2; Tr. \n33) \nApplicant stated multiple times, throughout the course of his September 2018 \nbackground interview, that he discontinued his marijuana use following the November \n2015 traffic stop. He adopted this statement, without any changes, in his August 2019 \nresponse to DOHA interrogatories and reaffirmed that he stopped using marijuana in \nNovember 2015. (GE 2 at 5, 22) \nIn June 2016, Applicant was pulled over by a highway patrol officer, and he was \narrested due to an outstanding warrant related to the incident that occurred in November \n2015. He was charged with possession of marijuana, in the first degree, a felony. \nFollowing his 2016 arrest, Applicant\u2019s defense attorney recommended that Applicant \nparticipate in a six-week drug education class. Additionally, the prosecution agreed to \ndismiss the charges (nolle prosse) after Applicant completed a six-month pretrial \nintervention program (PTIP). During the PTIP, Applicant was subject to six random drug \ntests, all of which were negative, and he was not diagnosed with a drug use disorder. He \npaid all associated fines and court costs. As a result of Applicant\u2019s compliance and \nsuccessful completion of the PTIP, the charges was dismissed. (GE 2; GE 3; GE 4; AE \n1; AE 2, AE 3; AE 4; AE 5; Tr. 31-32, 36-45, 58, 77, 87) \nApplicant testified that prior to his arrest in June 2016, he used marijuana three \ntimes a week. He affirmed in his March 2021 affidavit that he used marijuana until June \n2016. At the hearing, he was confronted regarding the inconsistent information he gave \nto the background investigator during his September 2018 interview. Specifically, that he \ndiscontinued using marijuana in November 2015. He claimed the inconsistency was the \nresult of confusion. (GE 2; AE 7; Tr. 78-79) \n3 \n \nAccording to Applicant, he was able to stop using marijuana in 2016, in part, due \nto the PTIP and the classes he received. He has not attended drug counseling or \nNarcotics Anonymous (NA) meetings since his PTIP program ended in approximately \nAugust 2017. As of the day of the hearing, he intended to continue to abstain from all \nfuture marijuana use and provided a signed affidavit affirming his intent.

He failed to disclose his \ninvolvement with illegal drugs, his 2015 traffic stop and 2016 drug-related arrest, and his \nemployment as a bouncer at the nightclub. Applicant admitted to the background \ninvestigator that he did not list his marijuana use, because he was afraid he would lose \nhis job. Additionally, he told the background investigator that his criminal defense attorney \ntold him he could have the 2016 arrest expunged from his record if he went through the \nproper steps, but at the time of the interview, he had not taken any action. (GE 2 at 4-5) \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that his criminal defense attorney told him that \nhe was not required to disclose the arrest in his 2018 SCA, because the charges were \nultimately dropped. Upon further questioning, he disclosed that he knew he was required \nto report his drug use, regardless of the status of the criminal charges. Additionally, he \nreaffirmed that he was concerned that his drug involvement and arrest he would cost him \nhis job. (GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 55-56, 80) \nFollowing both the incident in November 2015 and his arrest in 2016, Applicant did \nnot notify his employer, a defense contractor, of the issues. He was afraid that he would \nlose his job. At the hearing, he testified that he recognized that this was a mistake and a \nsecurity violation. (GE 2 at 3; GE 3; Tr. 33-34, 72) \nDuring his September 2018 background interview, Applicant admitted he had not \ndisclosed his drug use and arrest to his FSO, but he intended to notify them. In his August \n2019 response to the DOHA interrogatories, he stated that he disclosed the derogatory \ninformation to his FSO after he received the interrogatory package. At the hearing, he \nclaimed he told his FSO about his drug use and 2016 arrest in March 2018, prior to his \nbackground interview. (GE 2; GE 55-56, 60-62, 65-66, 73) \nAlthough his mother-in-law continues to use marijuana, Applicant has made it clear \nto her that she cannot use it at his home or around him. He no longer associates with \nanyone else who uses marijuana. His received a pre-employment drug test in 2016. \nFollowing a workplace accident, Applicant was screened in 2019, and both of these drug \ntests were negative. Applicant testified that he intends to provide truthful and accurate \ninformation regarding his drug and arrest history in the future.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Abuse and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted \nin this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence established the following \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThe burden shifted to Appellant to prove mitigation of the resulting security \nconcerns. AG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used;\nand \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \n \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nApplicant no longer associates with individuals who use drugs, and he has not \nused marijuana since his June 2016 arrest. He signed an affidavit that he will not use \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \ndrugs in the future. There is evidence that AG \u00b6 26(b) is at least partially applicable in this \ncase. \nApplicant successfully completed the PTIP related to his June 2016 arrest. \nHowever, there is no evidence in the record that the PTIP was a drug treatment program \nwith aftercare requirements, nor did Applicant submit a favorable prognosis from a \nqualified medical professional. Therefore, AG \u00b6 26(d) is not applicable in this case. \nApplicant used marijuana for the first time when he was ten. Starting as early as \n2003, he used marijuana with regularity, except between 2009 and 2012, when his \nemployer, a defense contractor, regularly conducted urinalyses of employees. \nSubsequent to this employment, Applicant worked for another defense contractor. He did \nnot disclose his pre-2009 drug involvement in his 2012 SCA. Additionally, because this \nemployer only required a pre-employment drug test, but did not conduct random \nurinalyses, Applicant resumed using and purchasing marijuana, despite holding a security \nclearance. He knew that drug involvement violated his employer\u2019s policies and DOD \npolicy. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn November 2015, Applicant was pulled over by police officers who seized two\nbags of marijuana from him, and one bag contained three-ounces. Despite this incident,\nhe continued to use marijuana frequently until he was arrested in June 2016. Applicant\u2019s\ndecision to purchase and use marijuana after he was granted a security clearance cannot\nbe considered a minor lapse in judgment, but rather a pattern of behavior that reflects his\nunwillingness to follow rules and regulations.  \n \nSecurity clearance decisions are not limited to conduct during duty hours. Off-duty \nconduct, especially where it reflects poor judgment, provides a rational basis for the \ngovernment to question an appellant\u2019s security worthiness. (See, e.g., Cole v. Young, 351 \nU.S. 536, 550 n.13 (1956); Croft v. Department of Air Force, 40 M.S.P.R. 320, 321 n.1 \n(1989)). Applicant\u2019s behavior showed a disregard for the law, regulations, and the \nfiduciary relationship he voluntarily entered into with the government.  \nAlthough Applicant stopped using marijuana almost five years ago, his history of \ndrug involvement and his extensive use, while holding a security clearance, raise \nsignificant concerns, especially since he was not forthcoming about this information \nthroughout the security clearance process, as discussed below. He failed to establish \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 26(a) and the drug involvement concerns are not mitigated. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concerns pertaining to criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n (b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe record evidence of Applicant\u2019s arrest establishes one disqualifying condition \nunder AG \u00b6 31: \nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised in this \ncase. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nIn August 2017, Applicant successfully completed the terms of his PTIP, and the \ncharges related to his June 2016 arrest were dismissed. Although there is no evidence in \nthe record that Applicant engaged in any subsequent drug-related criminal behavior, he \nfailed to provide honest, truthful, and complete information regarding his criminal history \nand drug involvement in both his 2012 SCA and January 2018 SCA. Under U.S. Criminal \nCode, Title 18, \u00a7 1001, it is a criminal offense to knowingly falsify or conceal a material \nfact in a SCA. Therefore, mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) was not established. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nApplicant\u2019s deliberate omissions of his drug involvement and arrest history in his \nJanuary 2018 SCA established the following disqualifying condition under AG \u00b6 16: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nAG \u00b6 17 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and be mitigating. \nTwo are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant falsified his criminal history and extensive drug involvement in his \nJanuary 2018 SCA. At the hearing, Applicant gave inconsistent testimony regarding the \ntimeline of his drug use and why he failed to disclose his marijuana use in his 2018 SCA, \nbut he eventually admitted he withheld information regarding his drug involvement, \nbecause he was afraid that it would negatively impact his ability to secure and keep a job \nfrom his employer, a defense contractor. \nApplicant also gave inconsistent testimony regarding why he failed to disclose his \ncriminal history in his January 2018 SCA. He told the background investigator in \nSeptember 2018 that his criminal attorney told him he could get the 2016 arrest and \ncharges expunged, but he had not taken the necessary steps. He affirmed that the \ninformation that he gave to the investigator was correct in August 2019. At the hearing, \nfor the first time, Applicant claimed that his criminal attorney told him he was not required \nto disclose the arrest in his SCA, because the charges were dismissed. These statements \nminimized his behavior, were self-serving, and demonstrate that Applicant continues to \nstruggle to be honest and forthright with the government regarding his behavior. \nApplicant told the background investigator in September 2018, that he \ndiscontinued using marijuana following the November 2015 traffic stop. He affirmed this \ninformation in his August 2019 response to interrogatories. In his affidavit and at the \nhearing, Applicant claimed that he stopped using marijuana in June 2016. At the hearing, \nhis explanation for this discrepancy was that he was confused. \nApplicant failed to disclose his drug involvement in his 2018 SCA, but it was also \ndeveloped at the hearing, that he also failed to disclose his drug involvement in his 2012 \nSCA. When questioned regarding this issue, he initially tried to minimize his behavior, but \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhe eventually admitted that he used drugs within the reporting period. He failed to disclose \nhis drug use on the SCA, because he feared it would affect his employment. \nAfter the November 2015 traffic stop and June 2016 arrest, Applicant did not inform \nhis supervisor or FSO of the incidents, nor did he disclose his marijuana involvement. He \ndid not inform his employer of these issues until he received a set of DOHA interrogatories \nin 2019. He acknowledged at the hearing that he knew he had a duty to report this \nderogatory information. \nApplicant made deliberate choices to keep the government and his employer in \nthe dark regarding his behavior, raising the concern that he is unreliable and \nuntrustworthy and calling into question his judgment and willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \nApplicant\u2019s statements and testimony regarding his drug involvement, his \ncompletion of his SCAs, and his reporting of these issues are inconsistent and lack \ncredibility. These inconsistent statements demonstrate that he continues to be untruthful \nwith the government. This concern has not been mitigated by the passage of time. He \nfailed to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(a), 17(b), and 17(c). \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H, J, and E in \nmy whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence. \nApplicant chose to use and purchase marijuana while working for multiple defense \ncontractors. He failed to disclose this information in both his 2012 and 2018 SCAs. There \nhas not been a sufficient passage of time to overcome the concerns with his drug \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \ninvolvement, criminal behavior, and falsifications. His hearing testimony was inconsistent \nand not credible, indicating a continued lack of truthfulness. \nApplicant has not met his burden of proof and persuasion. He did not mitigate the \nsecurity concerns or establish his eligibility for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of \nthe United States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to \nclassified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCAROLINE E. HEINTZELMAN \nAdministrative Judge \n11 \n",

He was last granted security eligibility in 2007. \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant failed to file Federal income tax \nreturns and pay Federal income taxes from 2004 to 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); failed to file state \nincome tax returns and pay state income taxes for tax years 2013 to 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); \nFederal tax liens were entered against him in 2012 and 2016 for approximately $14,467 \n(2012) (SOR \u00b6 1.e), $66,075 (2012) (SOR \u00b6 1.f), and $17,632 (2016) (SOR \u00b6 1.c); a state \ntax lien was entered against him in 2015 for approximately $11,437 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); and \ncharged-off and collection accounts totaling approximately $3,458 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g \u2013 1.j). \nTwo debts listed as SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.h are duplicates and will be considered under SOR \n\u00b6 1.j. \nWhile Applicant was married to his first spouse, he became delinquent on Federal \nand state income taxes and failed to file certain returns when due. He stated that he was \noften deployed while serving in the Navy, and he had a difficult relationship with his \nspouse. He became aware that his spouse had not filed income tax returns in about 2000. \nIn 2003 or 2004, he used a commercial tax service to help resolve his tax issues, but he \nwas not clear what they were able to accomplish. As part of the divorce, Applicant took \nresponsibility for the delinquent taxes. \nApplicant admits that from 2008 to 2011, he failed to take charge of his tax filings, \nand became concerned about the amount he owed the IRS. As alleged in the SOR, he \ndid not timely file Federal tax returns or pay taxes owed from about 2004 to 2011. \nAlthough he had a portion of his pay deducted from his salary for taxes, it was not enough \nto cover his tax obligations, and he began to accumulate interest and penalties. He \nbecame paralyzed with fear and took no action to correct his past tax delinquencies. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAfter 2011, Applicant started repaying his Federal tax obligations, and has paid \nabout $100,000 to date. The IRS garnished his pay in 2011 or 2012, and recovered about \n$5,000 per month over a one-year period. Thereafter, Applicant negotiated a repayment \nplan with the IRS and began paying $1,000 per month directly from his bank account. \nApplicant has shown regular and consistent payments since at least 2015, except for one \ndishonored payment in August 2020, which he intends to correct. He currently owes about \n$50,000 to the IRS. He has filed all of his tax returns to date, but his 2013 Federal and \nstate tax returns were filed late due to late delivery of documents to his accountant. His \nbrother-in-law is an accountant and files his tax returns. His Federal tax liens have not \nyet been released. \nApplicant owes State A about $25,000 for tax years 2013 to 2015. He was living in \nState A, but working in State B, and had his withholding sent to State B. Applicant has \nbeen making payments toward State A\u2019s past-due taxes since 2017, and paid off about \n$10,000 toward the debt. He currently pays $300 per month in a payment plan. State A \nreleased the tax lien noted in SOR \u00b6 1.d. Applicant resolved all of the credit card debts \nalleged in the SOR. His 2020 credit report shows no accounts in a collection status. \nApplicant\u2019s current spouse began living with him in 2011. Since that time, except \nfor the 2013 returns that were filed late, all tax returns have been filed and paid when due. \nHis spouse testified that she has helped him correct his tax issues since she moved in \nwith him, and noted that she will never let tax returns go unfiled. They discuss financial \nmatters and work together to ensure all tax returns are filed and taxes are paid. Their \ncombined household income is about $180,000 per year. Applicant earns the majority of \nthe income. He has not sought financial counseling, but uses an accountant to file tax \nreturns when due. He currently utilizes a budget and he has a $500 net monthly \nremainder. He owns a home, two paid-off cars, and has about $1,500 in savings. \nApplicant has been very active in leadership roles of a church and civilian \ncharitable organizations, and submitted favorable letters from a friend in one of the \norganizations, a coworker and supervisor. All attest to Applicant\u2019s service to his \ncommunity, church, and work. They note Applicant\u2019s integrity, loyalty, and dedication. \nApplicant noted that he has taken responsibility for his poor financial decisions in the past, \nand has taken positive step to correct them. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union, Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). Failure to comply with Federal tax laws suggests \nthat an applicant has a problem with abiding by well-established \ngovernment rules and regulations. Voluntary compliance with rules and \nregulations is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). \nApplicant has a history of failure to file tax returns and pay taxes when due. He \nbegan incurring tax delinquencies while married in a difficult relationship. He eventually \ndivorced and took responsibility for all delinquent taxes. He also had three credit-card \naccounts that became past due and were in collection. Typically, significant tax issues \nalone would serve to render an applicant untrustworthy. Applicants have a heavy burden \nto overcome that presumption. Without strong mitigating factors, it is difficult to show that \nan applicant should be otherwise entrusted with national security matters. In this case, \nApplicant has overcome questions about his reliability, judgment, and willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations, through a dedicated program to rehabilitate his tax \nstatus and pay for past tax delinquencies as contemplated by mitigating condition AG \u00b6 \n20(g). \nIn 2011, Applicant began addressing his tax issues after facing a garnishment \norder. After about a year of garnished wages, he negotiated a voluntary payment plan \nwith the IRS and state tax authorities. He remarried and his current spouse works with \nhim to ensure tax and financial matters are properly and timely addressed. He has shown \nyears of generally consistent tax repayment plan payments and has already paid off about \n$110,000 in state and Federal taxes, interest, and penalties. He filed all past-due tax \nreturns with the help of an accountant, and resolved the credit card debts. He has been \ncurrent with his tax filings since 2016. He has no delinquent accounts on his credit report, \nhas a positive net monthly remainder, and uses a budget to manage household expenses \nand debts. He uses an accountant to file his tax returns and has employed the accountant \nto clear up his past tax delinquencies. \nOverall, I believe Applicant is well on his way to resolving his tax debts and has \nnot incurred additional tax delinquencies in the past five years. He has established a \nreliable track record of tax plan payments, and he has shown that his financial problems \nare under control and unlikely to recur. He has sufficient combined income to ensure that \nhe can comply with the tax repayment plans and meet other expenses. I believe that \nApplicant has utilized the help from his spouse and accountant to responsibly manage \nhis tax obligations, will act responsibly in the future, and is not likely to repeat poor \nfinancial decisions.

Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s employment, divorce, and military service. Applicant has shown a recent \nhistory of ability, intent, and desire to meet his financial obligations in the future. \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security interest of the United States to grant him eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.j: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interest of the United \nStates to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.i, 1.l, 1.m, and 2.a. He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j, 1.k, and 3.a. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 30 years old. He married in 2012. His wife has two children from a previous marriage and relationship. Applicant adopted his wife\u2019s younger child. He and his wife have two biological children ages seven and six. He served in the military from 2010 until he was administratively processed in 2014 for serious misconduct and received a general discharge under honorable conditions. Applicant has worked for a federal contractor since 2016. Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s eldest daughter\u2019s (Daughter E) biological father is deceased. Daughter E was adopted by Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s former husband when they were married. When they divorced, the father did not want to be part of Daughter E\u2019s life or pay child support for her. The judge required someone to be financially responsible for the child before severing parental rights and responsibilities. Daughter E was adopted by her grandparents in 2010, when she was ten years old. Daughter E had a close relationship with her grandparents. Applicant was 20 years old when he married his wife in 2012.

DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript on August 20, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.i, 1.l, 1.m, and 2.a. He \ndenied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j, 1.k, and 3.a. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 30 years old. He married in 2012. His wife has two children from a \nprevious marriage and relationship. Applicant adopted his wife\u2019s younger child. He and \nhis wife have two biological children ages seven and six. He served in the military from \n2010 until he was administratively processed in 2014 for serious misconduct and received \na general discharge under honorable conditions. Applicant has worked for a federal \ncontractor since 2016. \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s eldest daughter\u2019s (Daughter E) biological father is deceased. \nDaughter E was adopted by Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s former husband when they were married. \nWhen they divorced, the father did not want to be part of Daughter E\u2019s life or pay child \nsupport for her. The judge required someone to be financially responsible for the child \nbefore severing parental rights and responsibilities. Daughter E was adopted by her \ngrandparents in 2010, when she was ten years old. Daughter E had a close relationship \nwith her grandparents. \nApplicant was 20 years old when he married his wife in 2012. She is nine years \nolder than Applicant. Daughter E was about 11 years old at the time they married. The \nyounger child was five years old. Daughter E lived with Applicant and her mother after \nthey married. \nIn September 2014, when Daughter E was 14 years old, Applicant\u2019s command was \nnotified by Family Advocacy that Daughter E had reported that Applicant sexually \nassaulted her. An investigation was conducted. Daughter E reported the sexual assault \nto counselors at a hospital where she was a patient due to cutting her wrists and suicidal \nbehavior. Daughter E reported that on one occasion, at their on-base residence, Applicant \nplaced his hand down her pants, under her panties, and touched her vagina. She \nexplained that while she and Applicant were wrestling, he \u201cpinned\u201d her while she was on \nher back and he was on top of her. He slid his hands down the front of her jeans and \ninside her panties. He did not penetrate her. She stated that he had also attempted to \nkiss her on multiple occasions and walked around the house naked. On one occasion, \nafter she witnessed him naked, he sent her a text message that read \u201cYour Welcome ;)\u201d \nIt had a \u201cwinking face\u201d emoji next to the phrase.

Daughter E told the counselor that Applicant walked around the house naked. \nDaughter E did not discuss with the counselor that Applicant attempted to kiss her. \nDaughter E told the counselor that Applicant told her that he was falling in love with her. \nThe counselor opined that Daughter E\u2019s suicide ideations and depression were more than \nlikely resulting from Applicant\u2019s actions and their relationship. A search of Applicant\u2019s \nphone confirmed the text message stating \u201cYour Welcome ;).\u201d (GE 6) \nApplicant was advised of his rights by investigators and admitted that he \nintentionally put his hands down Daughter E\u2019s pants after she fell on her back between \nthe couch and wall inside the residence\u2019s living room. He admitted sending the text \nmessage after Daughter E saw him naked. He also stated that he accidentally touched \nDaughter E\u2019s breast on one occasion. (GE 6) \nIn February 2015, after consulting with an attorney, Applicant waived his right to a \ncourt-martial and accepted Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) Article 15 nonjudicial \npunishment. He was charged with violation of UCMJ Article 120b: \nYou, did at or near [military base], between on or about June 28, 2012 and \non or about 13 September 2014, commit a lewd act upon [Daughter E], a \nchild who had not attained the age of 16 years, to wit: placed your hand \ndown the front of her pants and inside her underwear. \nYou, did, at or near [military base], on or about 15 August 2014, commit a \nlewd act upon [Daughter E], a child who had not attained the age of 16 years \nold, to wit: exposed your genitalia to Daughter E. (GE 6) \nApplicant chose not to have a personal appearance before the Commander at his \nUCMJ Article 15 hearing, but rather submitted a written presentation. It was not provided \nat this hearing. The Commander found Applicant committed the offenses. Applicant \nappealed the Article 15, which was denied. The proceeding went through the appropriate \nreviews and was found to be in compliance with the Manual for Courts-Martial. Applicant \nwas awarded a reduction in rate, 30 days extra duties, and a written reprimand. (GE 6) \nApplicant was administratively processed for discharge from the service in April \n2015 in the paygrade E-2. He received a general discharge under honorable conditions. \nThe narrative reason for separation was \u201cmisconduct (serious offense).\u201d (AE P) \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator as part of his security \nclearance background investigation. He told the investigator that he did not purposely \nexpose himself. He admitted that he may have inappropriately touched Daughter E by \naccident when they were playing and tickling, and she kicked him away. He stated he \nsleeps naked, and when the children are asleep he will walk around the house naked. He \nadmitted sending the text to Daughter E, but said it was a joke.

He said Daughter E had come \nback to live with the family. He stated: \nSince then this has been and will be the only incident to occur. Looking back \nI realize my mistakes and attribute my shortcomings to my lack of \nexperience as a father figure do (sic) to my marriage at a young age as well \nas my lack of understanding for investigation proceedings, in which at the \ntime of the incident declined a lawyer and was as compliant as I could be. I \nfelt a lot of pressure from all around. I understand the importance of \nmaintaining the role of father and aim to continue the role to the highest \nstandards. My behavior was inappropriate and I have grown as a father, \nhusband and person as a whole. I will continue to build myself and ensure \nthere is no future incident. \nI deny criminal allegations specified in [SOR] Item #3a. While my behavior \nmay have been of serious concern, no criminal charges were file[d] in a \nmilitary or civilian court. (Answer to SOR) \nAt his hearing, Applicant denied he intentionally exposed himself to Daughter E. \nHe said he got out of the shower and assumed the children were sleeping. He was naked \nwhen he saw Daughter E. He admitted he sent her the text with a \u201cwinking face\u201d emoji. \nHe said he was being sarcastic and joking. He testified it was not appropriate. He stated \nthat he never intentionally put his hand down Daughter E\u2019s pants, but it was possible he \ninadvertently \u201ctouched her waistband.\u201d He said they \u201chung out\u201d and tickled and \nroughhoused with each other. He recalled roughhousing with her once and she kicked \nhim and stormed off. Applicant stated Daughter E had behavioral problems. She was \nattending counseling at that time. \nApplicant testified that he was afforded a right to consult with an attorney prior to \naccepting Article 15 nonjudicial punishment. At the time, he and his wife were separated. \nHe had two small children that he had not seen. He said he was under a lot of pressure. \nChild Protective Services was involved. He stated this was a \u201cperiod of regret\u201d and he has \ngrown from it. He now understands the limitations of a father and certain lines must be \ndrawn. He testified none of his acts were intentional. He and his wife have since \nreconciled. Daughter E was sent to live with her grandparents. \nApplicant testified that a few years later he and his wife discussed Daughter E \nreturning to live with them.

Between 2015 and 2017, he and his family relocated several \ntimes looking for job opportunities. They eventually decided to put roots down in their \ncurrent location. From April 2015 to November 2016, Applicant worked overseas and sent \nmoney home to support his family. (GE 1) \nApplicant\u2019s wife testified that she was responsible for the family\u2019s finances. After \ntheir last move, Applicant has been more involved with their finances. Their federal \nincome tax returns were timely filed for 2015 and 2016. She believed that Applicant\u2019s \nincome that was earned overseas was not taxable. She said she was led to believe this \nas she processed their tax return through TurboTax. In approximately 2018, they were \nnotified by the IRS that they owed income taxes. They did not have the money to pay the \namount owed at that time. They were in contact with the IRS frequently over the past \nseveral years. She estimated about 30 times. \nSOR \u00b6 1.m alleges a federal tax debt of $18,490 for tax years 2015 and 2016. \nApplicant provided a copy of a July 2019 installment agreement with the IRS, which \nrequired he pay $150 a month for income tax owed for tax years 2015 and 2016, to begin \nin September 2019. Applicant provided documents to show he made the payments from \nSeptember 2019 through January 2020, and March 2020. In June 2020, the IRS received \nnotification that Applicant filed bankruptcy and in August 2020 the installment agreement \nwas canceled. There is no record of a new installment agreement. Applicant made $100 \npayments to the IRS in December 2020, January 2021, March 2021, and April 2021. In \nAugust 2021, he made a $500 payment. Through the years, Applicant\u2019s income tax \nrefunds have been involuntarily captured and applied to non-IRS debts and also toward \nbalances owed to the IRS. Tax transcripts also reflect that certain amounts owed were \n\u201cwritten off\u201d by the IRS. Applicant provided a copy of his 2020 federal tax return that \nreflects an anticipated refund of $7,495. His tax return is being processed. He anticipates \nthis refund will be applied to his delinquent tax debt and he will have a remaining \noutstanding balance of $785. (GE 3, AE M; Answer to the SOR) \nApplicant testified that he was aware of some of his delinquent debts, but thought \nsome would fall off their credit report. After his discharge from the service, money was \ntight. In 2019, after he received the SOR, he became aware of other delinquent debts. He \nspoke with a lawyer, who was not aware of his security clearance issues. He was advised \nto file bankruptcy and not pay his debts. He was led to believe the IRS debt would be \nresolved through bankruptcy. After receiving other advice, he was made aware his tax \ndebt would not be resolved through bankruptcy. The bankruptcy was dismissed at the \nrequest of Applicant. Many of the debts alleged in the SOR have been delinquent since \n2013, 2014, or 2015. After receipt of the SOR in August 2019, Applicant began taking \naction. He withdrew money from his pension plan to pay the debts, which he determined \nwould be his best option. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                     Policies \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant received a tax form 1099-C for tax year 2018 for the credit card debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($6,605).

Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(g) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant had numerous delinquent debts that began accumulating in 2013. He \nwas indebted to the IRS for delinquent taxes from tax years 2015 and 2016. There is \nsufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate with the \nappropriate tax authority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance \nwith those arrangements. \nApplicant began experiencing financial problems after his discharge from the \nservice in 2015. However, some debts were delinquent prior to then. He worked overseas \nfor part of 2015 and 2016, and his wife incorrectly believed his income was exempt from \npaying federal income taxes. In 2018, he was notified that he had a tax debt for those tax \nyears. In 2019, Applicant had an installment agreement with the IRS. He made a few \npayments. The installment agreement was canceled when he filed bankruptcy in June \n2020. Although he has made some independent payments towards his tax debt, primarily \nit has been paid through subsequent tax years\u2019 refunds and the IRS writing off balances \nowed. In addition, non-IRS debts have also been paid from tax refunds. Applicant did not \nbegin to address his delinquent debts until after he received the SOR. Although, he stated \nhe was advised to stop paying his debts when he filed bankruptcy, his debts were already \nseveral years delinquent at that point. \nThe timing of resolution of financial problems is an important factor in evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who takes action to resolve \nfinancial problems only after being placed on notice his or her clearance is in jeopardy \nmay lack the judgment, and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or \nwhen there is no immediate threat to his or her own interests. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n17-03229 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 7, 2019). \nApplicant was discharged from the service due to his misconduct. This was within \nhis control. His subsequent unemployment was somewhat beyond his control. Applicant\u2019s \ntax issues were somewhat beyond his control because of his wife\u2019s mistaken belief that \nhis overseas income was not taxable. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant \nmust have acted responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant did not begin to address \nhis delinquent debts until after he received the SOR. Many of his debts were years old. \nHe contacted the IRS to address his tax issues and had an installment agreement with \nthem, but it was canceled when Applicant filed bankruptcy. Most of Applicant\u2019s tax debt \nhas been paid by the involuntary application of subsequent tax years refunds. This does \nnot constitute a good-faith effort to repay his tax debts. A final accounting to show he has \nresolved all of his tax debt was not provided. He testified he anticipated that his 2020 tax \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrefund would satisfy most of the remaining balance, but not all. At this point, that is \nspeculative. Tax refunds for subsequent tax years have also been applied to non-IRS \ndebts. Applicant has made some independent payments to the IRS, but they have not \nbeen consistent. Although Applicant has paid most of the debts alleged in the SOR, I am \nunable to find that he acted responsibly under the circumstances or that he made efforts \nto pay his debts until after he received the SOR. His actions continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(d) are not \napplicable. AG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal application. \nThere is no evidence Applicant received financial counseling or he disputes any \ndebts. I find in his favor for the duplicate debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(e) do not \napply. Applicant had an installment agreement with the IRS, but it was canceled after he \nfiled bankruptcy. He made some payments in 2020 and in 2021 to the IRS and is relying \non a 2020 refund to satisfy most of his remaining tax debt, but apparently not all. AG \u00b6 \n20(g) does not apply. I find that financial considerations concerns remain despite the \npresence of some mitigation. \nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior \nThe security concern for sexual behavior is set out in AG & 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of sexual orientation of the \nindividual. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 13, and the following is \npotentially applicable: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted.  \nThe evidence supports that Applicant committed a lewd act upon his stepdaughter, \nwho at the time was under the age of 16 years old, by putting his hand down the front of \nher pants and inside her underwear. It also supports that Applicant exposed his genitalia \nto his stepdaughter, who at the time was under the age of 16 years old. The above \ndisqualifying condition applies. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom sexual behavior. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 14 are potentially \napplicable: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \nand \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment. \nApplicant\u2019s sexual behavior towards his stepdaughter in approximately 2014 is not \nmitigated. He was a grown man at the time and in a parental custodial relationship with \nhis stepdaughter. He has wavered regarding what he actually may or may not have done, \nbut indicates his regrets. As a 23-year-old, walking around the house naked with young \ngirls in residence is not a sign of immaturity, but rather a display of inappropriate conduct. \nThis is clearly evident when he sent his stepdaughter the text message and emoji. His \nstatement that he now understands the limitations of a father and certain lines must be \ndrawn alludes to some inappropriate behavior. He testified none of his acts were \nintentional. I did not find his testimony credible. Applicant\u2019s conduct casts doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 14(b) does not apply. Applicant was \nordered to attend some counseling through Family Advocacy before his military \ndischarge. His minimal counseling is insufficient and AG \u00b6 14(e) does not apply. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG & 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG & 31, and the following is \npotentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \nApplicant received Article 15 nonjudicial punishment after being charged with two \nspecifications of UCMJ Article 120b, committing a lewd act on a child under the age of \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n16. He did not demand a court-martial and was found guilty of the acts. He was \nsubsequently administratively processed from the service for serious misconduct, and \nreceived a general discharge under honorable conditions. The evidence is sufficient to \nconclude that Applicant committed the conduct. His statements and quasi-admissions \nthat allude to inappropriate conduct without actually saying what he did provide sufficient \ncorroboration. The above disqualifying condition applies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom criminal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand  \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited\nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution,\ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher\neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity\ninvolvement. \n \n \n \n \nThe same analyses that were detailed under the sexual behavior guideline apply \nunder the criminal conduct guideline. Applicant\u2019s conduct casts doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. Although there is some evidence of rehabilitation, it \nis insufficient to mitigate the security concerns. The above mitigating conditions do not \napply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines D, F, and J in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is 30 years old. I have considered his work performance and character \nevidence. He has an unreliable financial track record. He failed to meet his burden of \npersuasion regarding his past criminal conduct and sexual behavior. The record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under Guidelines D, sexual behavior; F, financial considerations; and J, \ncriminal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.l: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline D:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n13 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 56-year-old personal computer technician for a defense contractor, employed since December 2018. He received a high school equivalency certificate in 1983 and earned some college credits and information technology (IT) certificates. He was married in 2013 and divorced in 2014, but they continue to cohabitate. Applicant has one adult daughter that lives with him and two adult stepchildren. Applicant served in the Army National Guard and Army Reserve from 1990 to 2017, some of which was in the individual ready reserve. From 2005 to 2017, Applicant was on active duty as a volunteer Active Guard and Reserve (AGR). He was honorably discharged at the expiration of his military enlistment contracts. The SOR alleged under Guideline I that Applicant was twice evaluated in 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) by mental health professionals who called into question his judgment, reliability, trustworthiness and mental stability. Applicant denied the allegations. Under Guideline F, the amended SOR also alleged that Applicant has 17 delinquent debts totaling about $37,484. Applicant admitted all of the financial allegations. Applicant deployed to Afghanistan from 2013 to 2014, and served as an IT analyst and on occasion, in a personal security detail. He returned to his National Guard unit, but soon thereafter volunteered for a one-year assignment with the active duty Army in another state. He served in a dual role, filling a position of a sergeant major (",

DOHA received the hearing transcript \non October 30, 2020. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 56-year-old personal computer technician for a defense contractor, \nemployed since December 2018. He received a high school equivalency certificate in \n1983 and earned some college credits and information technology (IT) certificates. He \nwas married in 2013 and divorced in 2014, but they continue to cohabitate. Applicant has \none adult daughter that lives with him and two adult stepchildren. Applicant served in the \nArmy National Guard and Army Reserve from 1990 to 2017, some of which was in the \nindividual ready reserve. From 2005 to 2017, Applicant was on active duty as a volunteer \nActive Guard and Reserve (AGR). He was honorably discharged at the expiration of his \nmilitary enlistment contracts. \nThe SOR alleged under Guideline I that Applicant was twice evaluated in 2015 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a) and 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) by mental health professionals who called into \nquestion his judgment, reliability, trustworthiness and mental stability. Applicant denied \nthe allegations. Under Guideline F, the amended SOR also alleged that Applicant has 17 \ndelinquent debts totaling about $37,484. Applicant admitted all of the financial allegations. \nApplicant deployed to Afghanistan from 2013 to 2014, and served as an IT analyst \nand on occasion, in a personal security detail. He returned to his National Guard unit, but \nsoon thereafter volunteered for a one-year assignment with the active duty Army in \nanother state. He served in a dual role, filling a position of a sergeant major (E-9) while \nholding the rank of staff sergeant (E-6). This caused several conflicts when he attempted \nto protect his junior soldiers, and also a conflict with an Army officer that accused him of \nchest-bumping him. He felt that he had not decompressed for his deployment, and took \non additional stress in this position. \nApplicant was referred for a psychological evaluation at an Army medical center in \nMarch 2015. Applicant reported that he was treated in 2011 with Ambien for insomnia \nand that he and his spouse had marriage counseling in 2014. He reported the dispute \nwith the officer that resulted in his referral and the difficulty he was experiencing in the \njob. Applicant\u2019s personal problems checklist assessment showed no stressors.

His personality assessment inventory (PAI) suggested that Applicant may not \nhave answered in a forthright manner and showed that he was defensive and viewed \nhimself to be free of any shortcomings. The clinical assessment was that he was reflecting \nanti-social behavior. Despite this, the psychologist made no diagnosis and noted that he \ndoes not require treatment. His prognosis was \u201cgood,\u201d based on no problems reported. \nShe noted however that there does appear to be significant defects in psychological, \nsocial, or occupational functioning that could impair this judgment, reliability, or stability. \nShe gave him an unfavorable security clearance recommendation. \nAfter returning from assignment in about 2016, Applicant received orders for \nanother assignment with active duty troops after being home about one to two months. \nHe also received notice that he would be medically boarded for injuries he sustained in \nAfghanistan. This again increased his stress. He filled a position of a sergeant first class, \nwhile he retained the rank of staff sergeant. He believed the previous occupant of the \nposition was derelict in her duties and did not properly train the 20 subordinate soldiers \nfor whom she was responsible. Applicant believed the job was stressful, and added to his \neventual diagnosis for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). \nApplicant stated that he attended private counseling from about 2014 to November \n2017. He was discharged from the Army in 2017 with a medical separation, and he began \nemployment as a civilian contractor about four days later. He performed his job well and \nhad no incidents with coworkers. He spent about three years in physical therapy for neck \nand back injuries, and continues to be in pain from these injuries. He was prescribed \nZoloft by his primary care physician for PTSD that keeps him calm and content. \nIn March 2018, Applicant was re-evaluated by a private licensed psychologist at \nthe request of the DOD CAF. Applicant had difficulty arriving at his scheduled \nappointments on time, or making them altogether. He believes the doctor was biased \nagainst him for this reason. Applicant was diagnosed with PTSD. Although the doctor \ncould not make conclusions based on her meetings with Applicant, she opined that based \non his record, he demonstrated certain personality difficulties. She noted that Applicant \n\u201cplays by his own set of rules.\u201d She noted that besides PTSD, Applicant did not meet \ndiagnostic criteria for any other psychiatric condition. However, she determined that \nApplicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness are impaired, based on his history of \nanti-social behavior, his tendency to be evasive regarding his legal history, and his limited \ninsight into the ways he may have contributed to conflict in his relationships. She \nassessed his mental health prognosis as \u201cpoor\u201d and requiring intensive, long-term \ntherapy. \nApplicant testified that since his 2018 evaluation, he has been taking his \nmedication and has not had any confrontations except for a time where he protected his \ndaughter from a violent boyfriend. Applicant claimed the man was at his home when he \nbecame violent with his daughter. Applicant asked him to leave, and the man approached \nhim with a knife. Applicant stated that he calmly disabled the man and led him to the end \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nof his driveway to wait for police to arrive. The man was arrested and Applicant was \npraised for his response. \nApplicant has not taken action to address the SOR debts. He stated he was current \non his mortgage after a loan modification. He has not attended formal financial \ncounseling, but has read writings of a well-known financial manager who advises \naddressing the smallest debts first. At the time of the hearing, he had not filed his 2017 \nincome tax return because he is unable to determine how to report his overseas earnings \nwhile deployed. Applicant has about $400 in savings, and earns about $60,000 per year. \nHe noted that he has no net remainder after paying monthly expenses. \nApplicant received a $60,000 medical separation payment in 2017 and used the \nmoney left over after taxes to buy a 47-acre ranch. He rescues horses and other animals, \nbut has been generally unable to place them in new homes. He has had to learn \nregenerative farming techniques so that he can grow sufficient grass to feed his animals. \nApplicant has also taken over his step-son\u2019s car expenses. He has a budget and his \ndaughter and grandson live with him and his ex-wife. \nApplicant has an 80% disability rating from the Veteran\u2019s Administration (VA). He \nsees a primary care physician at the VA who treats his anxiety, but he has not requested \npsychological counseling or PTSD treatment. Applicant noted that he learned from past \ncounseling how to handle stress. He does not believe he has a current recommendation \nto attend counseling and does not feel a need for counseling while he is on his medication. \nHe noted he has \u201cgreat\u201d reviews by his employer and has not had any law enforcement \ninteractions in the past two years. No evidence of civilian employment problems or \nmanifested psychological issues since the 2018 assessment was offered into evidence. I \nfound Applicant\u2019s testimony to be straightforward, forthcoming, clear, calm, and sincere. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01295 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2015). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \nAnalysis \nGuideline I: Psychological Conditions \nAG \u00b6 27 expresses the security concern pertaining to psychological conditions: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 28 include: \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual has a condition that may impair judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness. \nThe admissions, testimony, and documentary evidence in the record are sufficient \nto establish the disqualifying condition under AG \u00b6\u00b6 28(b). \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 29 are potentially relevant: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with the \ntreatment plan; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the situation \nhas been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications of \nemotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nApplicant testified that he is taking a doctor-prescribed medication to assist him \nwith his PTSD symptoms. This medication has modulated his mood and reduced his \nanxiety to where he is functioning as expected. There is no evidence that Applicant has \nhad any psychological problems since leaving active duty. He has testified that he is \ngetting along well with his coworkers and members of his household. He noted that his \ndaughter, who lives with him with her child, has commented on the difference in \npersonality and ability to stay calm. \nThe evidence indicates that Applicant\u2019s condition is under control with medication, \nand that he no longer shows indications of emotional instability. He has been incident free \nfor at least three years, and he has learned from past counseling how to handle stress \nwhen it occurs. AG \u00b6 29 (a), (d), and (e) apply. \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nare sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (f). \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has long held: \nSecurity requirements include consideration of a person\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and a sense of his or her legal obligations. ISCR Case No. 14-\n04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016); Cafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union, \nLocal 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n(1961). Failure to comply with Federal tax laws suggests that an applicant \nhas a problem with abiding by well-established government rules and \nregulations. Voluntary compliance with rules and regulations is essential for \nprotecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at \n3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). Someone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \nApplicant admitted to an inability to satisfy debts. He has made the first steps \ntoward devising a plan to address them, but it is not enough to mitigate the financial \nconsiderations raised in the SOR. Applicant\u2019s income is apparently insufficient to \nmeaningfully pay past-due obligations, and he has not shown an ability to tackle the debts \nany time soon. In addition, Applicant has a past-due tax return that has not been filed. \nAlthough failure to pay Federal taxes when due was not alleged in the SOR, it is \nappropriate to consider it: \n(a) to assess Applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate his evidence of \nextenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether \nhe has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a \nparticular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to \nprovide evidence for whole-person analysis. See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Oct 26, 2006). \nBased on the record presented, I am unable to conclude that Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems are under control or are unlikely to recur. He has not established a reliable track \nrecord of addressing his debts and outstanding tax obligation, and he has not participated \nin formal financial counseling. He is learning sustainable farming to help with his animal \nmanagement, but the cost of managing the rescue animals appears to be beyond his \nfinancial means. I remain doubtful about Applicant\u2019s ability to meet past and future \nfinancial obligations. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \n8 \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guidelines I and F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s employment status and performance, military service, care for abandoned \nanimals, and intentions to resolve his debts and file his delinquent tax return. However, I \nremain unconvinced of his overall ability to meet financial delinquent obligations. The \nconcerns over his psychological condition have been mitigated. \nAccordingly, I conclude Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is \nclearly consistent with the national security interest of the United States to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n  Subparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2q:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n       Conclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interest of the United \nStates to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 59-year-old technical writer for a defense contractor, employed since June 2015. Applicant previously worked for a different defense contractor from 2010 to 2013, but was terminated for insubordination. He received an associate\u2019s degree in 2003. He married in 1974, and has two adult children. He honorably served in the U.S. Navy from 1969 until he retired in 1989. He deployed six to seven times while on active duty. Applicant was last granted security eligibility in 2007. The SOR alleges under Guideline E, that Applicant was terminated from employment in 2013 after showing an inability to control his temper, outbursts, leaving work without notice, and making a comment about \u201ckilling security guards.\u201d After accommodating him with work-from-home for 60 days, he returned to work and again engaged in disruptive behavior. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) The SOR also alleges Applicant was evaluated in November 2018, by a licensed psychologist at the request of the DOD CAF, and he exhibited frustration and anger with the evaluator, and yelled so loud that the evaluator\u2019s colleague checked on them.

On June 13, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct). The DOD CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec.

DOHA issued a new notice of \nhearing on November 5, 2020, and the hearing was convened on November 18, 2020, \nvia video teleconference. \nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8 were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. Applicant and two witnesses testified. Two other witnesses attempted to testify, \nbut due to teleconference communications problems they were inaudible, however they \nsubmitted amended statements after the hearing. Applicant submitted Applicant Exhibits \n(AE) A through D, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript on January 24, 2020. The record was held open to permit Applicant to submit \nadditional documentary evidence after the hearing. He timely submitted AE E (updated \nstatements and doctor\u2019s letter) and F (email), which were admitted without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 59-year-old technical writer for a defense contractor, employed since \nJune 2015. Applicant previously worked for a different defense contractor from 2010 to \n2013, but was terminated for insubordination. He received an associate\u2019s degree in 2003. \nHe married in 1974, and has two adult children. He honorably served in the U.S. Navy \nfrom 1969 until he retired in 1989. He deployed six to seven times while on active duty. \nApplicant was last granted security eligibility in 2007. \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline E, that Applicant was terminated from \nemployment in 2013 after showing an inability to control his temper, outbursts, leaving \nwork without notice, and making a comment about \u201ckilling security guards.\u201d After \naccommodating him with work-from-home for 60 days, he returned to work and again \nengaged in disruptive behavior. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) The SOR also alleges Applicant was \nevaluated in November 2018, by a licensed psychologist at the request of the DOD CAF, \nand he exhibited frustration and anger with the evaluator, and yelled so loud that the \nevaluator\u2019s colleague checked on them. The SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s inability to \nregulate his emotions during the interview and disruptive and inappropriate behavior raise \nquestions about his judgment and ability to properly safeguard classified and sensitive \ninformation. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) Applicant denied the SOR allegations. \nApplicant had disagreements with coworkers and management at his previous \nemployment. Applicant\u2019s previous personnel manager noted the following incidents in a \ntimeline from 2013: \n- \nMarch: Applicant got angry at a coworker and walked off the job, and did not return \nin the following two days. \n- \nApril: Applicant was reported to be \u201cvery boisterous and disrespectful over the last \nfew days.\u201d He was orally counseled. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n- \nJuly: Applicant made comments about \u201ckilling security guards.\u201d The incident was \ninvestigated and Applicant was warned to refrain from similar comments. \n(Discussed further below) \n- \nJuly: Applicant became angry with his coworkers and left the worksite without \nnotice (while on travel at another site). He returned two days later and then left \nagain after making comments to the site supervisor that he was feeling unstable \ndue to his new medications. A manager traveled to the site to meet with Applicant \nand his supervisors. Applicant noted that he was taking medication and his doctor \nwas adjusting the dosage to counter some of his reactions. He stated that he \nunderstood his behaviors were uncalled for, and that he needed to rein them in if \nhe was to continue working in his current position. Applicant was counseled that \nhis outbursts had to stop and that if he needed to go home, he should speak to his \nsupervisor. \n- \nJuly: Applicant had some behavioral issues the following two days, and he left work \nthe last time. The employer worked with Applicant and his supervisor to set up a \n60-day work-from-home accommodation to allow Applicant to smooth out his \nmedication issues and return to a normal work schedule. \n- \nAugust: Applicant returned to the office and was \u201cdisrupting the other staff.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor described it as \u201cepisode at work that ended with [Applicant] \nsaying, \u2018I f***ing hate this job and this company.\u2019 This resulted in a management \nagreement to end Applicant\u2019s employment for insubordinate behavior. \n- \nSeptember: Applicant was not permitted back into the facility, and was terminated. \nRegarding the alleged threat to kill a security guard, Applicant\u2019s program manager \nnoted in a July 10, 2013 email to management, that he was notified that an anonymous \nemployee reported overhearing Applicant on an open-speakerphone call, make \nthreatening comments about killing a security guard. He questioned Applicant about the \nincident. Applicant explained that the comment arose when a customer called Applicant \nto ensure that he was cleared to enter the facility so that he would not have to \u201ckill a \nsecurity guard.\u201d Applicant responded to the customer that he was indeed cleared to enter \nand joked that the customer would not have to kill a security guard. He explained that it \nwas just two retired military guys taking \u201ctrash\u201d back and forth. The employer investigated \nthe incident, and determined that the comment was overheard out of context. Applicant \nacknowledged that in today\u2019s environment, he should not be talking in such a manner. \nApplicant was told to \u201cwatch his words.\u201d The program manager closed the meeting with \nApplicant and was satisfied that there was no intended threat. The incident was \u201cclosed\u201d \nwith \u201cno further action required.\u201d Applicant\u2019s testimony was generally consistent with this \ndescription, and claimed that a female employee that he had previous \u201cissues\u201d with, \nreported him after overhearing the conversation. \nApplicant was first treated with Paxil for a mood disorder in 2003, after an auto \naccident.

Between 2008 and 2013, he was treated using different \nmedications. By 2013, Applicant acknowledged that his medication was not working well, \nand he had disagreements with coworkers. Applicant reported that the day he was fired, \nhe notified his employer and left for an appointment with his psychiatrist. That afternoon, \nhis office desk was cleared out and his possessions were mailed to his home. When he \nreturned to work, he was not granted access. He consulted another doctor in January \n2013, and as of July 2013, the doctor acknowledged treating Applicant for a mood \ndisorder. (AE A-1) The doctor noted in a letter of September 2013, that he had been \nadjusting medications and continued to do so. (AE A-1) \nApplicant noted that his former work environment was highly stressful because \nnewly hired employees were not able to meet their work responsibilities. He voiced his \ndisagreement with some of management\u2019s decisions, and had spoken \u201cloudly\u201d to a female \nemployee with whom he had a conflict, but he said he was \u201cnever aggressive to her or \nyelled.\u201d He also claimed he never walked off the job without permission from his manager. \nHowever, he agreed that he was having emotional difficulties in 2013. He consulted a \ncounselor on three occasions in 2013, but he stopped attending because he believed the \ncounselor was flirting with him. \nAfter being fired, Applicant remained out of work and stopped his medications for \nseveral months because they were not working and his stress level was low. Applicant \nbegan seeing a new family doctor in August 2015, who prescribed Applicant with alternate \nmedications to regulate his mood. \nThe DOD CAF referred Applicant to a civilian psychologist (Dr. E) for an evaluation \non November 28, 2018. Dr. E conducted a clinical interview with Applicant, and \nadministered a personality assessment inventory (PAI). She also reviewed Applicant\u2019s \nbackground investigation, including information about his previous employment, and \nmedical records. She also interviewed two of Applicant\u2019s current supervisors. She noted \nthat Applicant was being evaluated for \u201cinsubordination at various places of employment\u201d \nand interpersonal difficulties with coworkers. Also, she stated that \u201creportedly [Applicant] \nhad multiple outbursts at work in 2013 and was overheard to have \u201cthreatened to kill a \nsecurity guard.\u201d (GE 8) \nApplicant described his mental health history to Dr. E, and noted that the \ncombination of his current two medications was effective for managing his stress level. \nHe described his interpersonal conflicts with coworkers and supervisors, and stated that \nhe felt as though stress was piling up on him in 2013, and that he was not handling it well. \nHe said he would vent by using sarcasm when speaking to coworkers. He noted that he \nwas irritable at work, and the day he went to an appointment with his doctor, he was fired. \nApplicant completed a PAI, which suggested that Applicant \u201cdid attend \nappropriately to item content and responded in a consistent fashion to similar items.\u201d Dr. \nE noted that the PAI suggested that Applicant responded in a \u201cmanner to portray himself \nas relatively free of the common shortcomings to which most individuals will admit,\u201d which \ncould distort his profile and should be interpreted with caution as it may not represent an \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \naccurate picture of his clinical functioning.

Applicant \nbecame increasingly frustrated and asked Dr. E why he had to go through the evaluation. \nWhen Dr. E asked about the security guard incident, Applicant \u201cbecame extremely angry \nwith the evaluator. [Applicant] began yelling at a high enough volume that a colleague \nfrom down the hall came to the evaluator\u2019s office to ensure everything was okay.\u201d When \nasked about receiving two written warnings about his behavior by one of his employers, \nApplicant responded \u201cthat is a lie . . . No one said anything to me about having a problem.\u201d \nApplicant noted that he was mostly frustrated when he had to pick up other people\u2019s work, \nand claimed that he notified his supervisor when he had to leave work for \u201chalf a day if I \nneeded to get out of there.\u201d In testimony, Applicant acknowledged that he responded \nexcitedly when Dr. E asked him why he lied on his security clearance application, to which \nhe responded loudly, \u201cI what?\u201d His response showed his resentment to the accusation \nthat he lied. At that time, someone else entered the room to check on them. \nDr. E noted that Applicant\u2019s symptoms do not warrant an assignment of a DSM-5 \ndiagnosis at that time. However, she noted concern for Applicant\u2019s tendency to \nexternalize blame, especially as it relates to his actions at work. She also noted he \nappeared to assume that his coworkers should learn to accept his attitude rather than \nconsidering that he could potentially change to accommodate his coworkers. Applicant \nfelt persecuted by individuals at work, and he has limited insight into how his actions may \nhave been perceived by others. She noted that Applicant\u2019s inability to regulate his \nemotions during the course of a 1.5-hour clinical interview and psychological testing \n\u201cappears to potentially be indicative of an underlying issue with anger management.\u201d \nDr. E also noted that as a result of her interviews of Applicant\u2019s current and former \nsupervisors, that they did not report any concerns about his behavior or interpersonal \ninteractions. His supervisors described him as a good employee that gets along well with \nhis coworkers and supervisors, and they have not observed any problematic behavior \nduring the preceding three years he was at the company. \nDr. E reasoned that because of Applicant\u2019s previous decision to stop taking \nmedication after being fired, and the varying degrees of effectiveness of his medications, \nApplicant\u2019s behavior \u201cdeserves some further monitoring and attention.\u201d She stated, \u201cuntil \nhe is able to gain additional insight through therapy, there is a chance of him displaying \npotentially problematic behavior at work.\u201d She recommended Applicant begin treatment \nwith an individual therapist to \u201caddress these issues and gain additional insight into his \nbehavior.\u201d She noted with active participation, his mental health prognosis is excellent. \nIn sum, Dr. E stated that Applicant\u2019s behavioral history \u201csuggests his judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness have the potential to be impaired,\u201d however his recent \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nhistory shows that his interpersonal interactions \u201cdo not give cause for concern.\u201d Dr. E \nnoted that with \u201csome insight-oriented therapy and psychoeducation regarding his \nmedication, there would no longer be cause for concern regarding his judgment.\u201d (GE 8) \nIn November 2019, Applicant\u2019s family doctor noted in a letter (AE A-2) that \nApplicant had been under his care since 2015, for a mood disorder. He was taking \nrisperidone (Risperdal) and escitalopram oxalate (Lexapro) for his condition, which had \nbeen controlled for over four years. Applicant visits his doctor every six months to review \nhis medications. Applicant noted in testimony that his doctor does not recommend \ncounseling, anger management, or other treatment. After reading Dr. E\u2019s psychological \nevaluation, his doctor further noted in another letter dated November 20, 2020, that in his \nmedical opinion, \u201cApplicant\u2019s previous treatment was mismanaged and now he is under \ngreat control with his current treatment. At this time, it is an option to undergo therapy but \nI do not feel it is necessary.\u201d (AE E) \nIn his post-hearing submission, Applicant noted in an email dated January 7, 2021 \n(AE F), that after his hearing, he met with a counselor, Dr. MB, on four occasions. An \nonline check of the counselor to which Applicant referred shows that Dr. MB, is a Licensed \nProfessional Counselor and Supervisor near Applicant\u2019s home (Dr. MB\u2019s email address \nmatches that in AE F). Dr. MB received his Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Child Development and \nFamily Relations from Brigham Young University; a Master\u2019s Degree in Family and \nHuman Development from Utah State University; and a Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology from \nthe California School of Professional Psychology. He has practiced as a Marriage and \nFamily Therapist and as a Licensed Professional Counselor since 1980. Additionally he \nhas worked in an inpatient drug and alcohol rehabilitation hospital as the Clinical \nSupervisor, in an inpatient child/adolescent psychiatric hospital, and in a physical \nrehabilitation hospital. Dr. MB notes his areas of expertise to include counseling for \n\u201cdepression\u201d and \u201canxiety.\u201d Dr. MB\u2019s webpage is appended to the record as Hearing \nExhibit (HE) 1. \nIn AE F, Applicant stated that Dr. MB, \u201chas advised me that I have a handle on \nmyself and he no longer felt I needed to see him.

Dr. MB did not respond to Applicant\u2019s email and no \nindependent report or letter was submitted from Dr. MB. \nApplicant\u2019s current manager, a retired U.S. Air Force veteran with a top secret, \nsensitive compartmented information (TS SCI) security clearance, and a coworker, \ntestified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. Two others agreed to testify, but because of \ncommunications issues during the video teleconference, they were unable to, and \nsubmitted updated character letters instead. Applicant\u2019s manager noted that since 2015, \nwhen Applicant began working for his current employer, he has had daily contact with him \nas his task lead, supervisor, and now manager, and never observed any warning signs \nor cause for concern.

The manager noted in a letter that \nApplicant has exhibited exceptional patience and guidance, and is a trusted employee \nand mentor. He stated that because of Applicant\u2019s professional skills and dedication, \nApplicant has received numerous awards, merits, and a recent promotion.  \nApplicant\u2019s coworker testified that he was assigned to Applicant to be a mentor \nand works daily with Applicant since Applicant began at the company. The coworker was \non the interview committee when Applicant was hired, was aware of Applicant\u2019s past \nissues, and had been looking for any signs of problems. He stated that he has never had \na problem with Applicant, has never noted a threat, and that Applicant was a critical \nemployee that never exhibited emotional outbursts or emotional problems. He noted that \nany outbursts or improper conduct would not be tolerated at his company. In a character \nletter, he also noted that Applicant was professional, responsible, dedicated, humble, and \nreliable. He said, \u201c[Applicant\u2019s] interactions with coworkers make him a joy to work with, \nwillingly providing assistance to others.\u201d \nTwo witnesses that were unable to testify, provided pre-hearing letters and post-\nhearing updates. One witness, Applicant\u2019s supervisor with 30 years of experience as a \nmanager, supervisor and task lead, stated, \u201cI have had the pleasure of working alongside \n[Applicant] for four years  . . . where he has been and will continue to be entrusted with a \ngreat deal of responsibility.\u201d She described Applicant as pleasant, enthusiastic, and \ndedicated. She stated that, \u201cI wish that all of my coworkers had his attitude.\u201d She updated \nher letter after the hearing, and noted that Applicant told her about his situation, and she \nwas surprised that it occurred and she reflected back to when Applicant was hired in 2015. \nShe was his task lead and then supervisor. Out of caution, she discretely asked other \nteam members questions about their working relationship with Applicant. Everyone \nresponded positively. She received similar feedback from other company groups and \ncustomers. She noted that, \u201cI stand strong with [my] letter of recommendation and would \nnot change a word. [Applicant] is one of my strongest workers and it would be a great \nloss to the team and company if the outcome is any less than positive.\u201d (AE E) \nThe other witness also described Applicant as reliable, dedicated, with \u201cactions \nand skills above reproach.\u201d He said, Applicant is the standard when it comes to \nprofessional reliability. \u201cShould a question arise as to [Applicant\u2019s] character, take it from \nme; he is without a doubt the most stable and dependable employee I have ever had on \nmy team.\u201d The witness updated the letter after the hearing to include that he works with \nApplicant daily, and he is directly responsible for dolling out stressful tasks and shifting \ndeadlines to Applicant. He said Applicant has handled all with ultimate poise and \nprofessionalism. \u201cSince I desperately wanted my day in court to tell the judge how much \nof a joy working with [Applicant] really is on a daily basis, please accept this letter as any \ntestimony in lieu of our . . . interaction in court . . . .\u201d \nTen additional coworkers submitted letters in support of Applicant, attesting to his \nprofessionalism, generosity in the workplace, reliability, and consistently good behavior. \nLikewise, his performance evaluations also reflect his superior work, positive attitude, and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \neven the \u201crock\u201d of the company.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nNational security eligibility is predicated upon the applicant meeting the criteria \ncontained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. \nInstead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies \nthese guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider a person\u2019s stability, trustworthiness, reliability, \ndiscretion, character, honesty, and judgment. AG \u00b6 1(b). \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.

See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01- \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see, AG \u00b6 1(d). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E; Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but it not limited to, consideration of: . . . (2) any disruptive, violent, \nor other inappropriate behavior. \nThe personal conduct alleged is generally sufficient to implicate AG \u00b6 16(d). \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from incidents of personal \nconduct are provided under AG \u00b6 17. The following are potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17. Of note, \nApplicant\u2019s past difficulties with his medication and interpersonal differences with \ncoworkers were resolved many years ago. Although his vocal differences with \nmanagement, outbursts, and unscheduled absences from the workplace are inconsistent \nwith the workplace environment, such behavior does not always give rise to a security \nconcern. The company\u2019s documentation of Applicant\u2019s behavior in 2013 is less than \nthorough, and was not supported with a written investigation or witness statements. The \nallegation regarding a threat to a security guard was dismissed as innocent banter \nbetween friends on a speakerphone, was overheard by an employee that may have had \nan axe to grind, and was clearly taken out of context. The company concluded there was \nno viable threat or dangerous environment. \nApplicant was counseled by his supervisor for his outbursts and leaving work \nunexpectedly, and was provided a work-from-home schedule to assist in alleviating his \nstress and to allow him to regulate his medication. On the day he was terminated, he had \nan appointment with his doctor. Applicant acknowledges that his medication regime was \nineffective, which was corroborated by his current family doctor, and may have resulted \nin abnormal behavior in the workplace that impacted his ability to tolerate perceived poor \nwork practices of coworkers and management. To his credit, he recognized his \nshortcomings and was proactive in attempting to find the correct balance in his \nmedication. \nHis 2013 termination and the months to follow ended a difficult, emotional period \nfor him, and Applicant was determined to recover. With a new physician, he was finally \nput on the right track with his medication regime, and he began to see an improvement in \nhis outlook and ability to handle stress. He found new employment in 2015, and his \nperformance, attitude, and behavior have been nothing but outstanding since. Of \nparticular note is the strongly supportive testimony and letters from management and \ncoworkers. They paint a picture of a solid, balanced, and productive employee over that \npast nearly six years, with no indication of emotional turmoil, intolerance, or inappropriate \noutbursts. On the contrary, his current employer has put Applicant in charge of teaching \nothers and has recently promoted him. His performance evaluation adds additional \nsupport to the testimony of his coworkers. \nFinally, Applicant\u2019s personal physician and counselor disagree with the \nrecommendations of the DOD CAF consulting psychologist. I note that the psychologist\u2019s \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreport was less than convincing that Applicant\u2019s psychological condition was a security \nrisk. Rather, she concluded: \nsymptoms do not warrant an assignment of a DSM-5 diagnosis; testing \nappears to potentially be indicative of an underlying issue with anger \nmanagement; until he is able to gain additional insight through therapy, \nthere is a chance of him displaying potentially problematic behavior at work; \nwith active participation, his mental health prognosis is excellent; \ncurrent and former supervisors did not report any concerns about his \nbehavior or interpersonal interactions and they have not observed any \nproblematic behavior during the preceding three years he was at the \ncompany; history suggests his judgement, reliability, and trustworthiness \nhave the potential to be impaired; and recent history shows that his \ninterpersonal interactions do not give cause for concern. (emphasis added) \n \nGiven Applicant\u2019s long track record of appropriate behavior, excellent interpersonal \ninteractions, productive and reliable work history, and strong support from his current \nmanagement and coworkers alike, I am persuaded that Applicant\u2019s prior emotional and \nemployment history are well behind him. The most serious allegation involving threats to \na security guard, were unsubstantiated, but nonetheless partially formed the basis for the \nconsulting psychologist\u2019s conclusions. \n \n \nOf note, Applicant attended counseling after the hearing as a sign of good faith, \ndespite the recommendation by his personal physician that it was not necessary. \nApplicant noted the benefit he received from four sessions with the counselor, and stated \nthat the counselor no longer believed it was necessary to continue treatment. There is no \nevidence that the behavior exhibited in 2013 has recurred, and Applicant has shown by \nhis long-standing employment record with his current employer that he has successfully \nrecovered. I find that Appellant\u2019s personal conduct issues no longer cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), (d), and (f) apply. \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \n \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s military and employment history, and the support from his current physician, \ncounselor, employer, supervisors and coworkers.

The facts administratively \nnoticed are set out below in my findings of fact. \nApplicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through D, which were \nadmitted without objection. I kept the record open until February 16, 2021, to enable her \nto submit additional documentary evidence. She timely submitted AX E through I and \nadditional argument. AX E through I were admitted without objection, but Department \nCounsel challenged the additional argument. Applicant\u2019s additional argument is attached \nto the record as Hearing Exhibit (HX) I. Department Counsel\u2019s comments are attached to \nthe record as HX II. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on February 10, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d \nand 2.a-2.d. She denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 3.a. Her admissions in her \nanswer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 52-year-old linguist who has been offered employment by a defense \ncontractor, contingent on her ability to obtain a security clearance. She has never held a \nsecurity clearance. \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nApplicant was born in Baghdad, Iraq in July 1968. She lived in Syria from \nSeptember 2006 to December 2008. She was granted refugee status and came to the \nUnited States in December 2008. (Tr. 24.) She became a U.S. citizen in January 2014. \nApplicant attended college in Iraq for three years in business-related studies, but \nshe did not receive a degree. She took college courses in the United States from \nSeptember 2009 to August 2014 and received an associate\u2019s degree in marketing. (Tr. \n25, 67.) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother and father are citizens and residents of Iraq. They are both \nretired high-school teachers. They live in Kurdistan, one of the safer places in Iraq. \nApplicant has three children, ages 28, 25, and 22, all citizens and residents of the United \nStates. Her oldest daughter is a pharmacy technician. Her middle daughter is a property \nmanager for a rental company. Her youngest daughter was unemployed at the time of the \nhearing but had been offered a job as an apartment leasing agent. (Tr. 25-26.) Her 53-\nyear-old brother is a citizen and resident of the United States. He was employed by a U.S. \ngovernment agency engaged in clinical research and held a public trust position. He now \ndoes clinical research in the United States for COVID-19 vaccines. (Tr. 28-29.) Her 40-\nyear-old sister is a citizen and resident of Iraq, employed by a U.S.-based company that \noperates a private Christian school in Iraq. (GX 2 at 3.) Applicant speaks with her parents \nabout once a week and with her sister about once every two months. (Tr. 32.) Her \nrelationships with her parents and sister are alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a-1.c. \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant married an Iraqi citizen in September 1991. Her husband is 67 years old, \na naturalized U.S. citizen, and a retired engineer. He is currently employed as a cashier \nin a grocery store in the United States. (Tr. 26.) \nWhen Applicant and her husband were living in Iraq, Applicant owned and \noperated a construction company and worked as a subcontractor for a U.S. contractor for \nthree years. (Tr. 34-35, 68.) She was responsible for marketing, and her husband was \nresponsible for supervising construction. She did not review the contracts with the U.S. \ncontractor because of language issues, and her part of the contracting process amounted \nto a \u201ccouple emails.\u201d (Tr. 69.) Her parents and siblings did not know that she was working \nfor a U.S. contractor. (Tr. 41-42.) \nApplicant\u2019s husband was kidnapped in 2006. She believed it was because of their \nsupport for the U.S. forces. (Tr. 38.) The U.S. contractor for whom Applicant \nsubcontracted paid a $50,000 ransom to secure his release. (AX D at 1.) After Applicant\u2019s \nhusband was released, he and their daughters moved to Syria. At the end of 2006, after \nher family had moved to Syria and while she was still in Iraq, she was traveling with a \ndriver when they were stopped by local militia, who demanded her identification. She \nshowed them only her Iraqi identification and hid her passport because it reflected a visa \nfor travel to the United States. She was pulled from the vehicle and was beaten because \nof the way she was dressed. (Tr. 39-40.) \nAfter coming to the United States, Applicant worked as a part-time interpreter from \nJune 2009 to August 2010. She was unemployed from September 2010 to September \n2011. She worked in the private sector from September 2011 to May 2015. She and her \nhusband started a business in February 2012, working from their home in the United \nStates to act as an intermediary for providing for goods and services to U.S.-based \ncompanies in Iraq, Iraqi companies, and the Iraqi government. Her husband made all the \ncontacts and managed the finances. (Tr. 72-73.) Applicant\u2019s husband had some contacts \nwith the Iraqi government, but he refused to share the information about his contacts with \nApplicant. His refusal to share information with Applicant and their disagreements about \nthe scope of the business caused marital stress to the extent that she was contemplating \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndivorce when she underwent a personal subject interview (PSI) by a security investigator \nin April 2018. (GX 2 at 4.)The company was unsuccessful, and Applicant sought \nemployment elsewhere in August 2014, although the company was not dissolved until \n2016. (GX 1 at 25; GX 2 at 2-3; Tr. 45.) \nApplicant returned to Iraq with one of her daughters in 2015, because she was \nhaving discipline problems with her daughter and wanted to show her daughter how much \nbetter their life was in the United States. Applicant intended to live in Iraq with her \ndaughter for one year. (Tr. 77.) She worked as a marketing manager for a U.S. company \nin Iraq from June to December 2015. She returned to the United States about six months \nsooner than she planned when one of her other daughters was involved in a serious car \naccident. (Tr. 76.) She was unemployed from January to May 2016. She has worked for \nvarious employers in the private sector since May 2016. She had started working as a \nsales associate for an automobile dealership when she had her PSI in April 2018, but her \nemployer asked her to resign when she applied for a job as a linguist. (Tr. 114-15.) For \nthe past two years, she has been employed part time as a concierge in several apartment \nbuildings. \nIn 2018, Applicant was asked for help by an Iraqi woman who was in the United \nStates on green card, worked in the Iraqi Embassy in the United States, was pregnant, \nand whose husband was in Iraq. The record does not reflect that nature of the woman\u2019s \nwork in the Iraqi Embassy. Applicant testified that when they met, the woman was a \nstudent at a local university and was not working in the embassy. (Tr. 116.) Applicant \ntestified that her relationship with the woman was not a \u201cfriendship,\u201d but a helping \nrelationship because the woman was experiencing emotional and physical problems \nrelated to her pregnancy. Their relationship ended at the end of 2018, and they had no \nfurther contact. (Tr. 43-45.) Their relationship is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. \nApplicant last visited her family in Iraq in 2019 to attend a funeral for her aunt. At \nthat time, she complied with the Iraqi cultural requirement to obtain her parents\u2019 approval \nfor her daughter\u2019s marriage in the United States. (Tr. 42.) \nApplicant\u2019s mother owns two properties in Iraq that are worth about $50,000. \nApplicant and her brother have decided that they will give their share of their inheritance \nto their sister in Iraq in recognition of the fact that their sister has been the sole caregiver \nfor their parents. At the hearing, Applicant did not know if their agreement had been \nformalized in writing. (Tr. 32-33.) Applicant\u2019s potential inheritance is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. \nIraq is a constitutional parliamentary republic. The 2018 parliamentary elections \ngenerally met international standards for free and fair elections and led to the peaceful \ntransfer of power from Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi to Adil Abd al-Mahdi. In December \n2019, Prime Minister Abd al-Mahdi submitted his resignation in response to protester\u2019s \ndemand for changes to the political system, and the Iraq Council of Representatives \naccepted his resignation. In May 2020, Iraq\u2019s parliament confirmed Mustafa al-Kadhimi \nas prime minister, and in June 2020, the parliament confirmed his cabinet members, \nending the deadlock in government leadership. Prime Minister al-Kadhami declared that \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhis government would serve in a transitional capacity while preparing for elections in June \n2021. \nThe United States is committed to building a strategic partnership with Iraq. Iraq is \na key partner for the United States in the region and a voice of moderation and democracy \nin the Middle East. It has a functioning government and is playing a constructive role in \nthe region. The United States maintains vigorous and broad engagement with Iraq on \ndiplomatic, political, economic, and security issues. None of the administrative notice \ndocuments indicate that government of Iraq targets the United States for economic or \nmilitary intelligence, although it is likely that various terrorist and insurgent groups seek \nmilitary intelligence regarding U.S. military units operating in Iraq. \n \nNumerous terrorist and insurgent groups are active in Iraq, including ISIS and anti-\nU.S. sectarian militias. Rocket and improvised explosive device (IED) attacks against U.S. \nand Iraqi facilities and convoys are common. U.S. citizens in Iraq are at high risk for \nviolence and kidnapping. Numerous terrorist and insurgent groups are active and \nregularly attack Iraqi security forces and civilians. Anti-U.S. sectarian militias are directed \nat U.S. citizens and Western companies throughout Iraq. Militia groups kidnap local \nresidents, foreign workers, and members of international organizations and demand \nransoms from their families or their employers. The U.S. Department of State travel \nadvisory for Iraq is Level 4 (\u201cdo not travel\u201d), due to terrorism, kidnapping, and armed \nconflict. \nAn overwhelming number of human-rights abuses were committed by ISIS, \nincluding attacks on civilians. However, human-rights abuses by Iraqi civilian authorities \nand other state-sponsored organizations also have occurred. They included \ndisappearances; cruel and degrading treatment or punishment; hard and life-threatening \nconditions in detention and prison facilities; insufficient judicial institutional capacity; \nineffective implementation of civil judicial procedures and remedies; limitations on \nfreedom of expression; social, religious, and political restrictions in academic and cultural \nmatters; and abuse of women and ethnic, religious and racial minorities. \nThe U.S. State Department has substantiated reports of human rights abuses in \nIraq, including a climate of violence; misappropriation of authority by sectarian, criminal, \nand insurgent groups; arbitrary killings; torture; and other cruel, inhuman or degrading \ntreatment or punishment. The Iraqi government\u2019s effectiveness in adhering to the rule of \nlaw is hampered by ongoing violence, corruption, sectarian bias, and lack of oversight \nand accountability. Treatment of detainees has been generally poor. The judiciary is \nweak, and judicial independence is impaired by threats and killings by insurgent, \nsectarian, tribal, and criminal elements. Security threats hinder civilians\u2019 access to the \ncourts, and witness intimidation is common. \nIn January 2020, the U.S. military executed a drone strike that killed a Iranian \ngeneral who was in Iraq. The Iraqi government condemned the strike as a violation of \nIraqi sovereignty, and the Iraqi legislature directed the Iraqi government to remove all \nforeign forces from Iraq and end the use of Iraqi territory, waters, and airspace by foreign \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmilitary forces. In response, the U.S. Embassy in Iraq urged all American citizens to \ndepart Iraq immediately. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations. \nThe SOR alleges four delinquent debts reflected in the credit reports from March \n2018, April 2019, and October 2020 (GX 5, 6, and 7.) During the PSI in April 2018, she \ntold an investigator that she had been unable to resolve the debts while she was \nunemployed, but she had just begun working as a sales associate for a car dealer and \nintended to pay them. (GX 2 at 6.) She lost her job shortly after the interview, when her \nemployer learned that she had applied for a job as a linguist. \nApplicant testified that she has about $250 in her bank account, but no retirement \naccount, savings, or investments. She does not own a car, but her husband owns a 15-\nyear-old compact car. (Tr. 80.) Her daughters help her financially. (Tr. 59) Her husband \nrefuses to assist with paying the family bills. Applicant testified that her husband told her \nthat he had taken care of the family for 25 years and now it was her turn to take care of \neverything. (Tr. 119.) Applicant tried using a debt-resolution company to assist her, but \nshe terminated the contract after three months because the company made no progress. \n(Tr. 119-20.) \nThe evidence concerning the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR is summarized \nbelow: \nSOR \u00b6 2.a: retail-store charge account charged off for $5,615. This account \nwas charged off in May 2016. (GX 5 at 2.) Applicant testified that she contacted this \ncreditor in December 2020, but the creditor insisted on full payment and would not make \na payment agreement. (Tr. 96.) She decided to make minimum payments until she could \nmake a payment agreement or pay the amount due in full. (Tr. 96.) She made $15 \npayments on December 7, 2020, and January 4, 2021. (AX C.) \nSOR \u00b6 2.b: credit-card account charged off for $3,000. This account was \ncharged off in January 2016. (GX 6 at 2.) In November or December 2020, Applicant \nmade a payment agreement providing for payments of $375, and she made her final \npayment in January 2021. (AX A.) This debt is resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 2.c: department-store charge account charged off for $2,508. This \naccount was charged off in January 2016. (GX 5 at 3.) Applicant testified that she \ncontacted this creditor in December 2020, but the creditor would not make a payment \nagreement. (Tr. 96.) She decided to make minimum payments until she could make a \npayment agreement or pay the amount due in full. (Tr. 96.) She made $15 payments in \nDecember 2020 and January 2021. (AX C; AX E.) \nSOR \u00b6 2.d: credit-card account charged off for $2,100. This account was \ncharged off in February 2016. (GX 6 at 2.) She made a $50 payment in December 2020. \n(AX C.) In January 2021, she made an agreement providing for monthly payments of \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n$137. (AX B; Tr. 98-99.) She made the required $137 payment in February 2021. (AX F; \nAX G.) \nApplicant told an investigator during the April 2018 PSI that she believed that the \nfour debts alleged in the SOR were cancelled. She realized her debts had not been \ncancelled after she was questioned about them during the PSI. She told the investigator \nthat she was unemployed and unable to make any payments on them, but that she \nintended to start making payments when she started receiving the commissions she \nearned from selling cars. She was unable to keep that promise because the automobile \ndealer terminated her when he learned that she had applied for a job as a linguist. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant deliberately falsified her SCA by answering \u201cNo\u201d \nto the questions about financial delinquencies and failing to disclose the debts alleged in \nthe SOR. The investigator\u2019s summary of the April 2018 PSI includes the statement, \u201cShe \nwas not sure why she did not list this required information.\u201d (GX 2 at 6.) At the hearing, \nshe testified that at the time of the PSI, she was not sure if she still had delinquent debts. \n(Tr. 63.) In her answer to the SOR, she stated that she thought \u201ccharged off\u201d meant that \nthe debt was cancelled. \nCharacter Evidence \nA retired federal employee, who is working as a full-time volunteer for a charitable \norganization for Iraqi orphans, met Applicant in 2016 and considers her creative, reliable, \nloyal, and trustworthy. (AX D at 2.) \nApplicant\u2019s 25-year-old daughter remembers vividly how strong her mother was \nwhen their father was kidnapped and how her mother became the family provider when \ntheir father had difficulty finding employment in the United States. She admires her mother \nfor her courage and commitment. (AX D at 3.) \nApplicant\u2019s 28-year-old daughter describes Applicant as a role model and \u201ca great \nexample of the American dream.\u201d She admires Applicant for many reasons, \u201cbut mainly \nfor her ability to continue pushing forward through every obstacle she faces.\u201d She \nconsiders Applicant \u201ca positive and ambitious individual who only knows love and loyalty \nfor this country.\u201d (AX I.) \nA tenant who has observed Applicant working as a \u201cconcierge\u201d for their apartment \ncomplex admires her for her trustworthiness, hard work, attention to detail, and proactive \napproach to her job. (AX D at 4.) \nApplicant\u2019s sister describes Applicant as the family protector who has an \n\u201cappreciation for the American democracy and way of life\u201d and who wants her children to \n\u201chave a life where liberty and freedom is a right\u2014not a privilege.\u201d She considers Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto be \u201ca determined woman who has found her home and comfort in the United States.\u201d \n(AX H.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \n8 \n\n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s mother, father, and sister are citizens and \nresidents of Iraq (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c). It also alleges that she has a friend who is a citizen of \nIraq and is employed by the embassy of Iraq (SOR \u00b6 1.d). Finally, it alleges that Applicant \nand her siblings will inherit their mother\u2019s two properties in Iraq with a value of about \n$50,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual maybe manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are potentially \napplicable: \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; \nAG \u00b6 7(f): substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could \nsubject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation \nor personal conflict of interest; and \nAG \u00b6 7(g): unauthorized association with a suspected or known agent, \nassociate, or employee of a foreign intelligence entity. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(d), 7(e) and 7(f) all require substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened \nrisk.\u201d The \u201cheightened risk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a \nrelatively low standard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk \ninherent in having a family member living under a foreign government. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 12-05839 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 2013). \u201cHeightened risk\u201d is not a high standard. \nSee e.g., ISCR Case No.17-03026 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 16, 2019). \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those \nof the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nFurthermore, \u201ceven friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity.\u201d ISCR Case No. 00-0317 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002). Finally, we know friendly \nnations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, \nscientific, and technical fields. \nNevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United \nStates, and its human-rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an \napplicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or \nthe country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the United States. In \nconsidering the nature of the government, an administrative judge must also consider any \nterrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. \nBd. Dec. 7, 2006) (reversing decision to grant clearance where administrative judge did \nnot consider terrorist activity in area where family members resided). When family \nmembers are involved, the totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well \nas each individual family tie must be considered. ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. \nSep. 22, 2003). \nThe citizenship and residences of Applicant\u2019s mother, father, and sister are \nsufficient to establish the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c and raise the heightened risk in \n10 \n\n \nAG \u00b6 7(a) and the potential conflict of interest in AG \u00b6 7(b). The evidence supporting the \nallegation in SOR \u00b6 1.e is inconclusive. Applicant\u2019s mother owns two properties in Iraq, \nbut she and her brother have decided to give their potential inheritance rights to their \nsister in recognition of the care she has provided for their aged and ailing parents. \nHowever, there is no documentary evidence that they have carried out their intent to give \nup their inheritance rights.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.d is established. An applicant\u2019s ties, either directly or \nthrough a family member, to persons of high rank in a foreign government or military are \nof particular concern, insofar as it is foreseeable that through an association with such \npersons the applicant could come to the attention of those interested in acquiring U.S. \nprotected information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-10025 at 2 and 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, \n2009) (Applicant\u2019s brother was a high-level foreign government official); ISCR Case \nNo.11-04980 at 2 and 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 21,2012) (Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law was married \nto a retired high-ranking official in a foreign army); and ISCR Case No. 11-12632 at 2 and \n5 (App. Bd. Feb. 2, 2015) (Applicant\u2019s niece was an employee of a high-ranking foreign \ngovernment official). Applicant does not know for whom her friend worked. She thought \nher friend was a \u201cfirst secretary,\u201d but was unsure. In any event, this allegation has been \novercome by events, because the relationship ended in 2018.  \n \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \nAG \u00b6 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; and \nAG \u00b6 8(f): the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or \nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and \ncould not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual. \n11 \n\n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a) is not established. Although Applicant\u2019s parents and sister reside in a \nsomewhat safer part of Iraq, the dangers from terrorism, insurgency, lawlessness, and \narmed conflict preclude application of this mitigating condition. \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) is established. Applicant, her spouse, her brother, and her children are \nU.S. citizens and residents. Her children are pursuing careers in the United States. \nApplicant had a track record of supporting the interests of the United States until her \nhusband was kidnapped. She is a strong-willed and determined woman, fiercely devoted \nto the United States, and not easily intimidated. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c) is not established. There is a rebuttable presumption that contacts with \nan immediate family member in a foreign country are not casual. ISCR Case No. 00-0484 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2002). Applicant has not rebutted this presumption regarding her \ncontacts with her sister in Iraq. \nAG \u00b6 8(f) is established. Although the value of the properties owned by Applicant\u2019s \nmother is significant, Applicant and her brother have no desire to inherit them. \nFurthermore, because of the uncertainties surrounding the expectancy of an inheritance, \nan applicant does not have a financial stake in a country merely because he or she may \ninherit real or personal property at some time in the future from his or her parents who \ncurrently reside in that country. ISCR Case No 97-0403 at 3 (App. Bd. May 13, 1998).  \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe SOR alleges four charged-off debts. The security concern under this guideline \nis set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence submitted at the hearing \nestablish three disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \nand \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are recent, frequent \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established. Applicant\u2019s debts are the result of unemployment, \nunderemployment, and her husband\u2019s refusal to provide financial support. She has acted \nresponsibly by contacting her creditors, establishing payment plans, and making minimal \npayments on the debts for which she was unable to negotiate payment plans. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant hired a debt-resolution company for a short \ntime, but it did not provide the financial counseling contemplated by this mitigating \ncondition. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established. Applicant has paid off the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.b, \nhas negotiated a payment agreement for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a, and is making \nminimal payments on the two remaining debts until she can negotiate payment \nagreements or pay them in full. The adjudicative guidelines do not require that an \nindividual make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, pay the debts alleged \nin the SOR first, or establish resolution of every debt alleged in the SOR. He or she need \nonly establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant actions to \nimplement the plan. See ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \n13 \n\n \nApplicants are not held to a standard of perfection in their debt-resolution efforts or \nrequired to be debt-free. \u201cRather, all that is required is than an applicant act responsibly \ngiven his circumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by \n\u2018concomitant conduct,\u2019 that is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the \nplan.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017). See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n13-00987 at 3, n. 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 14, 2014). Applicant has a reasonable and credible \nplan and has taken significant action to implement it. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIt is well established that past irresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of debts \nonly under pressure of qualifying for a security clearance. Applicants who begin to \naddress their security-significant conduct only when their personal interests are at stake \nmay be lacking in judgment and reliability. ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, \n2018). However, in this case, Applicant did not realize that her debts were not cancelled \nuntil she was interviewed by a security investigator. She could not begin making \npayments immediately, because she was unemployed. As soon as she found \nemployment, she contacted her creditors and began resolving her debts. \nNotwithstanding Applicant\u2019s meager earnings as a concierge, she has paid off one \ndebt, negotiated a payment agreement for a second debt, and has been making token \npayments on the two remaining debts. The evidence indicates that Applicant\u2019s recent \nprogress in resolving her debts is not motivated by self-interest but by a sense of \nobligation.  \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nThe relevant disqualifying condition under this guideline is AG \u00b6 16(a): \n[D]eliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, as in this case, the Government has \nthe burden of proving it. An omission, standing alone, does not prove falsification. An \nadministrative judge must consider the record evidence as a whole to determine an \napplicant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the omission. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 \n14 \n\n \n(App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004). An applicant\u2019s experience and level of education are relevant \nto determining whether a failure to disclose relevant information on a security clearance \napplication was deliberate. ISCR Case No. 08-05637 (App. Bd. Sep. 9, 2010). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAlthough Applicant is a well-educated adult, English is not her first language. The \nbelief that charged-off debts are cancelled is a common misperception in financial cases. \nShe had no prior experience with the security-clearance process and no experience in \ninterpreting credit reports. She readily admitted the charged-off debts during the PSI and \nat the hearing. She has a reputation for trustworthiness. I am satisfied that she did not \ndeliberately falsify her SCA. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not established. No other disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline are established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines B, F, and E in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant has endured \nmultiple hardships, and she has amply demonstrated her resilience, determination, and \nloyalty to the United States. She was sincere and credible at the hearing. After weighing \nthe disqualifying and mitigating conditions under these guidelines and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by her family, social, and financial connections to Iraq; her \ndelinquent debts; and her failure to disclose her delinquent debts in her SCA. \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B (Foreign Influence):  \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nFOR APPLICANT \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 39 years old. He was born in Kuwait. He immigrated to the United States in 2000 and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2009. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree from an American university. (Tr. 16-17, 44; GE 1) Applicant married in 2003 and divorced in 2009. He remarried in Jordan in 2013 to a Jordanian citizen. His wife moved to the United States in 2015 and is a permanent resident. They have no children. Applicant paid a substantial amount for the wedding, but testified he could not recall how much exactly he spent. His wife also contributed \u201ca little bit too.\u201d (Tr. 45). He is his wife\u2019s sole provider. (Tr. 17-18, 44-45, 62; GE 1; AE B, C, D) In late 2018, Applicant and his wife returned to Kuwait so he could try and get a job at the U.S. embassy. From there she traveled to Jordan in late 2018 and has remained there because her father was sick. Applicant did not get a job in Kuwait, so in April 2019, he returned to the U.S. from Kuwait. His wife stayed in Jordan while he continued to look for work in the United States. He explained that he wanted to get a job and get the household settled before she returned to the U.S. and it was easier for him to do it alone. His wife has been caring for her father since then and plans to return to the United States in the next few week",

I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on June 23, 2021. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 7. There \nwere no objections and the exhibits were admitted into evidence. As part of his answer to \nthe SOR, Applicant included Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through H. At the hearing, AE I \nthrough M were offered into evidence. (Due to an administrative error, a second AE H \nwas offered. I remarked this as AE N, next in order.) All exhibits were admitted without \nobjection. The record was held open until June 30, 2021 to permit Applicant to submit \nadditional documents, which he did. They were marked AE O and P and were admitted \nwithout objection. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) I is Department Counsel\u2019s memo) DOHA received \nthe hearing transcript on July 2, 2021. \nAdministrative Notice \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout the countries of Jordan and Lebanon. (HE II and III). Without objection, I have taken \nadministrative notice of the facts contained in the request. The facts are summarized in \nthe written request and will not be repeated verbatim in this decision. Of particular note is \nthe significant threat of terrorism and ongoing human rights problems in both countries. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is 39 years old. He was born in Kuwait. He immigrated to the United \nStates in 2000 and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2009. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree \nfrom an American university. (Tr. 16-17, 44; GE 1) \nApplicant married in 2003 and divorced in 2009. He remarried in Jordan in 2013 to \na Jordanian citizen. His wife moved to the United States in 2015 and is a permanent \nresident. They have no children. Applicant paid a substantial amount for the wedding, but \ntestified he could not recall how much exactly he spent. His wife also contributed \u201ca little \nbit too.\u201d (Tr. 45). He is his wife\u2019s sole provider. (Tr. 17-18, 44-45, 62; GE 1; AE B, C, D) \nIn late 2018, Applicant and his wife returned to Kuwait so he could try and get a \njob at the U.S. embassy. From there she traveled to Jordan in late 2018 and has remained \nthere because her father was sick. Applicant did not get a job in Kuwait, so in April 2019, \nhe returned to the U.S. from Kuwait. His wife stayed in Jordan while he continued to look \nfor work in the United States. He explained that he wanted to get a job and get the \nhousehold settled before she returned to the U.S. and it was easier for him to do it alone. \nHis wife has been caring for her father since then and plans to return to the United States \nin the next few weeks. He provided a copy of her airline ticket. She has a special re-entry \nvisa that permitted her to remain outside of the United States for longer than six-months. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nShe was a pharmacist assistant and hopes to continue her studies in the U.S. and to seek \ncitizenship when she is eligible.

They have no ties to the Jordanian government. \n(Tr. 25-35, 59, 62-66, 72; AE J, O, P) \nApplicant has one sibling, a sister, who was born in Kuwait and is a citizen of \nGermany, living in Lebanon. She teaches at an American school there. She is married to \na German national and has two children. He is a lawyer who splits his time between \nGermany and Lebanon. Applicant speaks to his sister about every six months, and they \nlast visited together in the United States in 2014. She traveled to the United States in \n2016 and was a visiting professor at a university. Applicant and his sister did not visit \neach other at that time. His father and mother are permanent residents of the United \nStates. (Tr. 35-41, 66-68) \nApplicant testified that he came to the United States when he was 18 years old. \nHe has been a refugee all of his life and the U.S. is the only place that gave him an \nopportunity and a sense of belonging. He was in Kuwait during the Gulf War and \nafterwards he and his family traveled to find a place to settle. He considers the United \nStates his home. (Tr. 41-42) \nApplicant disclosed in his September 2017 security clearance application (SCA) \nhis prior work history. From September 2007 to March 2011, he was an office \nadministrator. From March 2011 to August 2017, he was a sales representative. He was \nprimarily unemployed from October 2017 to April 2019. In about November 2017, he \nbegan working for a federal contractor, but this was not a full-time job and he only worked \nsporadically when he was called in. The last time he was called in to work was from April \n2018 to September 2018. He was able to collect unemployment benefit for about four \nweeks, but it was insufficient to cover all of his expenses. In April 2019, he worked for a \nwholesale food company until July 2020 when he lost his job due to the pandemic. In \nNovember 2020, he began work as a district manager for a food distribution company. \n(Tr. 18, 21-25, 45-50; GE 1, AE E) \nApplicant testified that in 2014 his father needed emergency surgery and was later \ndiagnosed with cancer. Applicant traveled to Lebanon to be with his father where the \nsurgery was to take place. His father did not have the financial resources to pay for his \nmedical needs. Applicant made the choice to help his father financially and used credit \ncards to pay for the medical expenses. Applicant testified that he made some payments \ntowards the credit card delinquencies in about 2017, but due to his underemployment he \nhas not been able to repay his debts. Applicant testified that he has not paid the credit \ncard debts alleged in the SOR because he is recovering financially and is helping support \nhis family and wife. (Tr. 19-21; AE K) \nApplicant testified that he intends to repay his delinquent debts. After Applicant \ncompleted his SCA in September 2017, he became aware that his finances were a \nsecurity concern. He provided a document to show he participated in financial counseling \nin January 2020, and he discussed his personal financial situation with the counselor in \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndetail. He supplied the counselor with information needed to provide him with options and \nthey discussed workable solutions that would help improve his finances. (AE A) He never \nexecuted the proposed plan. He did not provide any supporting documents to show he \nhas made any payments toward resolving his debts. (Tr. 52-53) \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($8,146) is a credit card debt and his March 2019 credit \nreport shows there has been no activity on the account since October 2014. Applicant \ncould not recall if he contacted the creditor. He testified that he has not made any effort \nto negotiate a settlement or pay this debt. (Tr. 53-54; GE 3) The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \nthrough 1.j appear on his May 2021 credit report. Applicant has four delinquent accounts \nwith the same collection company. The debts date back to 2014 and it appears a minimal \npayment was made on each account in 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.b-balance $4,575-payment-$55; \n\u00b6 1.d-balalnce $3,424-payment-$41; \u00b6 1.g-balance $1,676-payment-$20; and \u00b6 1.h-\nbalance $1,268-payment-$15). No other payments were made on these accounts or on \nany of the other SOR delinquent debts. He has not contacted any of these creditors to \nnegotiate settlements or resolve the debts. (Tr. 54-58; GE 5) \nApplicant\u2019s current annual salary is approximately $56,000. He has no savings and \nis living paycheck to paycheck. He has no other assets. The debts alleged in the SOR \nare corroborated by Applicant\u2019s admissions and credit reports from November 2017, \nSeptember 2018, March 2019, February 2020, and May 2021.(Tr. 58-59, 69; GE 1, 2, 3, \n4, 5, 6, 7) \nApplicant provided character letters. His work performance is described as \nexemplary while performing as a role player. He is also described as dedicated, \nintelligent, self-disciplined, open-minded, respectful and respected, productive, and an \neffective communicator and listener. (AE L, M) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nThere is a significant threat of terrorism and ongoing human rights problems in \nJordan and Lebanon. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a potential conflict of interest \nand a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and \ncoercion, both directly and through his wife. The above disqualifying conditions have been \nraised by the evidence. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following is potentially applicable: \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and  \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk of foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Jordan through his wife and to \nLebanon through his sister. The nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the \nUnited States, and its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an \napplicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the government, the \ncountry is known to conduct intelligence operations against the United States, or the \nforeign country is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nApplicant\u2019s wife is a permanent resident of the United States. She has been living \nin Jordan attending to her sick father and will be returning to the United States shortly. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s ties to the United States outweigh his ties to Jordan and Lebanon. He \nhas been in the United States for 19 years and earned his college degree. His wife will \nbe returning to the United States and is a permanent resident who will seek citizenship \nwhen eligible. His parents are also permanent residents. His background is compelling \nas he was a refugee and now is a loyal citizen of the United States. I find that evidence \nsupports that if presented with a conflict of interest that Applicant\u2019s loyalties to his adopted \ncountry are deep and longstanding and that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest. AG \u00b6 8(b) applies. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHer parents are retired. There is no evidence that she or they have any ties to the \nJordanian government. Applicant\u2019s sister is a German citizen living in Lebanon where she \nis a teacher at an American school. There is no evidence she has any ties to the Lebanon \ngovernment. Applicant maintains some ties to his sister. AG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply.  \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has 10 debts totaling approximately $30,239 that have been delinquent \nsince approximately 2014 and remain unresolved.

The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to helping to pay for his father\u2019s medical \nexpenses that were incurred in 2014. Helping his father was an honorable act and his \nfather\u2019s medical issues were beyond his control. Applicant has also been underemployed \nand unemployed, which was also beyond his control. For the application of AG \u00b6 20(b), \nApplicant must show he has acted responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant made \na couple small payments towards a few debts in 2018, but has not taken any other action \nregarding resolving these debts that are now almost seven years old. His minimal \npayments three years ago do not constitute a good-faith effort to repay his creditors. \nAlthough he says he intends to pay them, he has not provided a plan for how he intends \nto do so. He participated in financial counseling, but there is no indication that his financial \nproblems are being resolved or are under control. His debts are recent, ongoing, and \nunresolved. There is insufficient evidence to fully apply any of the above mitigating \nconditions. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and B in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant helped his father with his medical bills in 2014. He has not paid the credit \ncards that he used to pay these expenses. At this juncture, he has an unreliable financial \ntrack record. He has not met his burden of persuasion to mitigate the Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations security concerns. He has provided sufficient evidence to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns under Guideline B, foreign influence. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-j: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He was granted a security clearance at some point. He \ntestified that after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the military was reducing \nthe number of its security clearances, and because Applicant had been granted a waiver \nto enlist, a government investigator interviewed him.

The investigator confronted Applicant \nwith the May 2004 revocation letter from the DON CAF, which stated his clearance was \nrevoked due to his failure to mitigate drug involvement concerns. Applicant explained that \nbecause he needed a clearance to perform his duties, he could not reenlist in the rate he \nwas in, so he completed his enlistment and was honorably discharged in 2005.

His Schedule E-unsecured priority claims were for \n2008 and 2009 unpaid state taxes.

It was denied in approximately May 2016, due to his finances at the time. (Tr. \n28, 84-86; GE 2) \nApplicant completed a security clearance application in October 2017. Question \n26 asks about his finances and whether he had failed to file or pay Federal, state, or other \ntaxes in the past seven years. Applicant answered \u201cno.\u201d It also asked about other financial \ndelinquencies, whereby Applicant disclosed some of his delinquent debts. (GE 1) \nApplicant answered government interrogatories in June 2019. In them he disclosed \nhe failed to timely file his 2016 federal tax return (SOR \u00b61.d). He stated the reason was \nbecause he was concentrating on delinquent accounts on his credit report and he forgot \nto file. (GE (2) He also stated: \nI attempted to file the return but misunderstood TurboTax. When it said \nfinished and completed, I thought it was sent to the IRS. When I looked at \nit again recently it actually said it was complete but I had to mail it in. So I\u2019m \nin the process of doing it now.

It showed he had a balance of $5,635 owed as of August 2021. \nApplicant also disclosed that he filed his 2016 state tax return on June 15, 2019. He did \nnot owe taxes for that year. He disclosed that he owed $92 for his 2018 state taxes. SOR \n\u00b6 1.f alleged that Applicant owed delinquent state taxes for tax years 2014 and 2018 in \nthe total amount of $562. Applicant provided documents showing that he paid this debt in \nSeptember 2019. (Tr. 21, 30-34; Answer to SOR; AE J) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.e alleged Applicant owed $5,459 for tax year 2014; $9,779 \nfor tax year 2015; and $4,002 for tax year 2018. Applicant disclosed in his interrogatories \nthat he failed to pay his 2015 and 2018 federal income taxes and owed $9,780 and $4,002 \nrespectively. He indicated that he had recently initiated a payment plan with the IRS, and \nhe would be required to pay $250 a month, but at that time it had not yet started. The \ninterrogatory did not ask about his 2014 tax debt. (Tr. 31; GE 2) \nApplicant testified that after receiving the SOR, he contacted the IRS and made a \npayment agreement.

The divorce decree \nprovided that Applicant\u2019s wife would be responsible for the car debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g \n($16,956) even though the car was titled in Applicant\u2019s name. She defaulted on the loan. \nI find in Applicant\u2019s favor on this debt. (Tr. 25-26, 28, 34-40 \nThe creditor for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h ($7,695) obtained a judgment against \nApplicant in July 2017.

It is \nresolved. (Tr. 52; Answer to SOR) \nApplicant testified that after receiving the SOR and being confronted with his \ndelinquent debts, he is now aware of how important it is to be financially responsible and \nhe has acted responsibly and has not overextended his finances. Applicant has a loan \nfrom his 401K pension plan that he is repaying. He took the loan to pay bills. He has not \nparticipated in financial counseling. (Tr. 61-64, 75-76) \nAny derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will not be considered \nfor disqualifying purposes. It may be considered in mitigation, when making a credibility \ndetermination, and in a whole-person analysis. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local tax as required. \nApplicant has a long history of financial problems cumulating with his 2011 \nbankruptcy. Subsequently he accumulated delinquent debts that are not resolved. He \nfailed to timely file his 2016 federal income tax return. He failed to timely pay his federal \nincome taxes for multiple years and his state income taxes for two years. There is \nsufficient evidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant has unresolved delinquent debts. He also owes federal income taxes for \nmultiple tax years. He has a long history of financial problems. In 2011, he had \napproximately $120,000 of debt discharged in bankruptcy. His financial problems \ncontinued and then were aggravated by his failure to pay his federal and state income \ntaxes. I cannot find that his behavior is unlikely to recur. His behavior casts doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his 2014 divorce and his ex-wife\u2019s \nfailure to pay some of the debts assigned to her. This condition was beyond his control. \nFor the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must have acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. It has been seven years since Applicant\u2019s divorce. His divorce did not \nimpact his ability to timely file his federal income tax return for 2016 or coordinate a \npayment plan with the IRS prior to receiving the SOR. He did not provide sufficient \nevidence that he has an installment agreement with the IRS. Since 2019, he has made \nsome payments towards his tax debts. Applicant has not acted responsibly. AG \u00b6 20(b) \nhas minimal application. \nThere is no evidence Applicant has participated in financial counseling. Applicant \nprovided evidence that the delinquent debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.j, 1.l were paid. AG \u00b6 20(d) \napplies to these debts. The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.f and 1.h were paid, but AG \u00b6 20(d) \ndoes not apply. A garnishment is not considered a good-faith effort to repay a creditor. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to address his delinquent taxes until after receiving the SOR does not \nconstitute good-faith. \nApplicant paid his delinquent state taxes and has made some payments towards \nhis delinquent federal tax debt. AG \u00b6 20(g) applies to his state taxes. However, he did not \nprovide evidence that he has an existing installment agreement with the IRS and is in \ncompliance with it. He is given some credit for his payments, but it is insufficient to apply \nAG \u00b6 20(g) or to mitigate the financial issues raised. Applicant indicated he paid certain \ndebts but did not provide sufficient evidence to substantiate his claims. AG \u00b6 20(e) does \nnot apply to those debts. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems. He had $120,000 of delinquent debt \ndischarged in bankruptcy in 2011. He resolved one debt after a judgment was entered \nand his wages were garnished. He did not provide sufficient evidence to conclude other \ndebts were paid. Some of the debts are more than seven years. \nApplicant failed to timely file his 2016 federal income tax return. He failed to timely \npay his federal income taxes for multiple years and his state income taxes for two years. \nHe did not begin to address his tax issues until after he received the SOR. The timing of \nresolution of financial problems is an important factor in evaluating an applicant\u2019s case \nfor mitigation because an applicant who takes action to resolve financial problems only \nafter being placed on notice his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment, \nand self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate \nthreat to his or her own interests. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03229 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. \n7, 2019). \nIn addition, The DOHA Appeal Board has held that: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with these things is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. August 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961).  ISCR Case No. 12-10933 at 3 (App. Bd. June \n29, 2016). \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence in mitigation regarding his finances. \nThe record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nsuitability for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f, 3.a, and 3.b. He denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 33-year-old vehicle refueler employed by a defense contractor since October 2005. He received a security clearance in May 2007. He has never married, but he has lived with a cohabitant since October 2016. He and his cohabitant have a 16\u00ad month-old daughter. (Tr. 19.) Applicant testified that he began using marijuana in occasional social settings in 2001, when he was 14 years old, and he used it until about 2013 or 2014. He stopped using it because his employer started random drug testing, and he realized that it could jeopardize his job. (Tr. 23.) In his first SCA in February 2007, he answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question whether he had used a drug or controlled substance within the past seven years. (GX 1 at 23.) He testified that he could not remember why he did not disclose his marijuana use. (Tr. 28.) He also testified that there was no reason why he continued to use marijuana until 2014, except stupidity. (Tr. 30.) Applicant was arrested in April 2008 and charged with brandishing a firearm. His arrest occurred after he was involved in a bar fight, and one of the participants told police that he had brandished a firearm.

The \nGuideline H concerns are mitigated, but the concerns under Guidelines J and E are not \nmitigated. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on February 2007, and \nhe received a security clearance. He submitted another SCA in February 2017, seeking \nto continue his clearance. On July 15, 2019, the Department of Defense Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nsecurity concerns under Guidelines J, H, and E. The DOD CAF acted under Executive \nOrder (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \n1 \n\n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on November 4, 2019, and requested a decision on \nthe written record without a hearing.

I convened the hearing as rescheduled. \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1 through 13 were admitted in evidence without objection. \nApplicant testified but did not present the testimony of any other witnesses or submit any \ndocumentary evidence. I kept the record open until May 21, 2021, to enable him to submit \ndocumentary evidence. He did not submit any additional evidence. DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) on May 26, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f, \n3.a, and 3.b. He denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a. His admissions in his answer and at \nthe hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 33-year-old vehicle refueler employed by a defense contractor since \nOctober 2005. He received a security clearance in May 2007. He has never married, but \nhe has lived with a cohabitant since October 2016. He and his cohabitant have a 16\u00ad\nmonth-old daughter. (Tr. 19.) \nApplicant testified that he began using marijuana in occasional social settings in \n2001, when he was 14 years old, and he used it until about 2013 or 2014. He stopped \nusing it because his employer started random drug testing, and he realized that it could \njeopardize his job. (Tr. 23.) In his first SCA in February 2007, he answered \u201cNo\u201d to the \nquestion whether he had used a drug or controlled substance within the past seven years. \n(GX 1 at 23.) He testified that he could not remember why he did not disclose his \nmarijuana use. (Tr. 28.) He also testified that there was no reason why he continued to \nuse marijuana until 2014, except stupidity. (Tr. 30.) \nApplicant was arrested in April 2008 and charged with brandishing a firearm. His \narrest occurred after he was involved in a bar fight, and one of the participants told police \nthat he had brandished a firearm. The police stopped him as he drove away from the \nscene of the fight. He testified that he has never owned a firearm. The police searched \nthe vehicle and did not find a firearm. He appeared in court and was found not guilty \nbecause the police were unable to find a firearm. (GX 4 at 3; Tr. 34-35.) \nApplicant was arrested in February 2009 and charged with possession of \nmarijuana. After the police stopped him for speeding, they found marijuana in the center \nconsole of his car. He appeared in court and adjudication was deferred. He was placed \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \non probation for one year, required to attend drug-education classes, and was subjected \nto random urinalysis. He successfully completed his probation and the charges were \ndismissed. (GX 4 at 3; GX 5.) He did not disclose this arrest in his February 2017 SCA, \nbecause he was told that his arrest record would be expunged. (Tr. 31.) \nIn November 2010, Applicant was arrested and charged with possession of \nmarijuana and having defective equipment on his car. After Applicant completed a period \nof probation and drug classes, the prosecutor filed a nolle prosequi. (GX 12.) Applicant \ndid not disclose this arrest to his employer. He testified that he was unaware of any \nrequirement to disclose arrests to his employer. He did not disclose this arrest or his \ncontinued use of marijuana in his February 2017 SCA, because he was afraid that it would \njeopardize his clearance and his job. (Tr. 32-33, 39.) \nIn January 2011, Applicant was charged with reckless driving, having an open \ncontainer of alcohol in his car, and possession of marijuana. Applicant was with his \ncousin, and he told the police that the marijuana was his, because he did not want his \ncousin to get in trouble. (Tr. 44-45.) Applicant was convicted of the open-container offense \nand reckless driving, but the marijuana charge was dismissed. (GX 13.) \nIn November 2013, Applicant was arrested for maliciously causing bodily injury to \nhis cohabitant. He testified that his cohabitant was driving home after they had been \ndrinking at a bar, they began arguing, his cohabitant began swerving, and he grabbed the \nsteering wheel to keep the car from striking a guardrail. The police officer who noticed the \nswerving stopped them, noticed a cut on the cohabitant\u2019s forehead, and concluded that \nApplicant had hit her in the face. Applicant spent a week in jail after his arrest. (Tr. 53\u00ad\n55.) The charge was later reduced to assault and battery. In February 2014, the court \nfound \u201cfacts sufficient to find guilt,\u201d but deferred adjudication for one year. The charge \nwas dismissed in February 2015. (GX 7.) \nApplicant submitted his second SCA in February 2017. He answered \u201cNo\u201d to a \nquestion whether, during the last seven years, he had illegally used any drugs or \ncontrolled substances. He also answered \u201cNo\u201d to a question whether he had ever used \nor otherwise been involved with a drug or controlled substance while possessing a \nsecurity clearance. (GX 2 at 26.) \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in September 2018, he \ntold the investigator that he had never been charged with an offense related to alcohol or \ndrugs. When the investigator confronted him with evidence of his arrest record, which \nincluded drug offenses, he disclosed his marijuana use, beginning in his teenage years \nand ending in 2014. He told the investigator that he did not disclose his marijuana use \nwhile holding a security clearance because it did not matter, since he had stopped using \nmarijuana. He also told the investigator that he did not disclose his marijuana use because \nhe misread the question. (GX 3 at 12-13.) \nIn July 2018, Applicant was charged with assault and battery on his cohabitant. \nApplicant testified that he was driving home after work after a long work day and spending \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsome time at a friend\u2019s house. He fell asleep and hit the rear of an 18-wheel truck. His \ncohabitant came to the scene and was taking him home when they began arguing, \nbecause his cohabitant refused to take him to a hospital. Applicant became angry and \ncracked the windshield of their car by punching it with his fist. His cohabitant called the \npolice, who concluded that they had been fighting. (Tr. 57-63.) A protective order was \nissued, prohibiting Applicant from having any contact with his cohabitant for three days. \n(GX 9.) \nApplicant testified that he was charged and the protective order was issued \nbecause his cohabitant \u201cgot all hysterical\u201d and told the police that he had smacked her. \nHe admitted that, on several occasions, he grabbed her and shook her after she said \nthings intended to provoke him. (Tr. 50-51.) In September 8, 2018, he appeared in court \nand pleaded no contest. The judge found \u201cfacts sufficient to find guilt\u201d and deferred \nadjudication until September 2020. (GX 8.) Applicant completed his probation and the \ncharge was dismissed. (Tr. 63.) Applicant and his cohabitant stayed apart for about seven \nor eight months after his arrest. (Tr. 64.) He testified that most of their arguments arose \nfrom his cohabitant\u2019s desire that he stay at home instead of socializing with friends away \nfrom home and her practice of saying things that she knew would provoke him. He \ntestified that the arguments and physical violence stopped after their daughter was born. \n(Tr. 51-52.) \nIn November 2018, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving under the \ninfluence (DUI). His blood-alcohol content (BAC) was 0.17. In the jurisdiction where he \nwas arrested, jail time is mandatory for a BAC at or above 0.15. In March 2019, Applicant \nwas convicted and sentenced to 180 days in jail, with 175 days suspended, and a $250 \nfine. He was placed on unsupervised probation for one year. His driver\u2019s license was \nrestricted for one year, and he was required to install an ignition interlock on his vehicle. \n(GX 10.) He served his jail sentence on weekends. (Tr. 66.) \nApplicant admitted that many of his arrests were related to alcohol, but he does \nnot believe he has an alcohol problem. He has reduced his drinking since the birth of his \ndaughter. He drinks mainly on weekends and limits himself to about two drinks or two \nbeers. (Tr. 67.) He has never been diagnosed with an alcohol-abuse disorder or received \ntreatment for it. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant was arrested in April 2008 and charged with \nbrandishing a firearm (SOR \u00b6 1.a), arrested in February 2009 and charged with \npossession of marijuana (SOR \u00b6 1.b), arrested in July 2013 and charged with assault on \na family member (SOR \u00b6 1.c), arrested in November 2013 and charged with felony \nmalicious injury and unlawful wounding (SOR \u00b6 1.d), arrested in July 2018 and charged \nwith assault on a family member and placed under an emergency protective order (SOR \n\u00b6 1.e), and arrested in November 2018 and charged with driving under the influence (DUI) \n(SOR \u00b6 1.f). \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d Applicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence presented at the hearing establish \nthe disqualifying condition in AG \u00b6 31(b): \u201cevidence (including, but not limited to, a credible \nallegation, an admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.\u201d \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \nAG \u00b6 32(c): no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed \nthe offense; and \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) are not established. Applicant\u2019s arrests and convictions are \nnumerous and did not occur under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. He was on \nprobation until March 2020, slightly more than a year ago, which is insufficient time in the \ncontext of his long criminal record to make recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 32(c) is established for SOR \u00b6 1.a (brandishing a firearm), for which there \nwas no evidence, but not for the other criminal conduct alleged in the SOR. \n6 \n\n \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant purchased and used marijuana with varying \nfrequency from about 2001 to 2013 or 2014, and that his use of marijuana continued after \nhe was granted access to classified information in May 2007 (SOR \u00b6 2.a). The concern \nunder this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia; and \nAG \u00b6 25(f): any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBoth mitigating conditions are established. Applicant has acknowledged his drug \ninvolvement. It is not clear whether he has disassociated from his drug-using associates, \nand he has not provided the signed statement of intent. However, he has abstained from \nmarijuana since 2014. \nThe first prong of AG \u00b6 26(a) (Ahappened so long ago@) focuses on whether the \ndrug involvement was recent. There are no Abright line@ rules for determining when \nconduct is Arecent.@ The determination must be based on a careful evaluation of the \ntotality of the evidence. If the evidence shows Aa significant period of time has passed \nwithout any evidence of misconduct,@ then an administrative judge must determine \nwhether that period of time demonstrates Achanged circumstances or conduct sufficient \nto warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation.@ ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. \nAug. 4, 2004). Applicant\u2019s abstinence from marijuana has been for a \u201csignificant period of \ntime,\u201d motivated by the realization that marijuana use can jeopardize his security \nclearance and his job. I conclude that the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s drug \ninvolvement have been mitigated by the passage of time. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant falsified his 2007 and 2017 SCAs by his deliberate \nfailure to disclose his marijuana involvement. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.b). The security concern \nunder this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish that \nhe did not fully disclose his marijuana use in either of his two SCAs, raising the following \ndisqualifying condition: \nAG \u00b616(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. Applicant did not disclose his marijuana involvement \nuntil a security investigator confronted him with evidence of marijuana involvement during \na security interview in September 2018. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. Applicant falsified two SCAs, including the February \n2017 SCA on which this adjudication is based. Falsification of an SCA is not \u201cminor\u201d \nbecause it \u201cstrikes at the heart of the security clearance process.\u201d ISCR Case No. 09-\n01652 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2011.) \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines J, H, and E in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, \nbut some warrant additional comment. The birth of Applicant\u2019s daughter apparently was \na significant event for him, and it has caused him to reconsider his previous lifestyle, but \nI am not convinced that the volatile relationship between him and his cohabitant will not \nresurface. Nor am I convinced that sufficient time has passed to ensure that he will not \nrevert to his previous irresponsible behavior once the excitement over the birth of his \ndaughter wears off and the pressures of rearing a child set in. I have noted his candor \nand sincerity at the hearing, but it is offset by his years of deception during the security-\nclearance process. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuidelines J, H, and E, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, \nI conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by criminal conduct, \ndrug involvement, and personal conduct. \n9 \n\n \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1-b-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H (Drugs): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a and 3.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \nLeRoy F.
