The \ncase was assigned to me on January 9, 2024. The Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on January 18, 2024, and the hearing was \nheld as scheduled on February 14, 2024. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1-12, \nwhich were admitted into evidence without objection. The Government\u2019s exhibit list and \ndiscovery letter were marked as HE I and II. Applicant testified and offered exhibits (AE) \nA-U, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) \non February 29, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer, she admitted all the allegations, except for selling marijuana \nduring the timeframe of August 2021 to December 2021, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.b, which \nshe denied. Her admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of \nfact. \nApplicant is 39 years old. She is divorced (married from 2008 to 2022). She has \nfour children, ages 21, 17, 13, and 12. She provides total financial support for the three \nyoungest children with no assistance from her ex-husband. Applicant\u2019s disabled mother \nalso lives with her. She has taken some college courses. She was hired by her current \nemployer in September 2022 and she was promoted to a quality engineer position in \nAugust 2023. (Tr. 7, 36; GE 1-2) \nFinancial Concerns \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged three bankruptcy filings in 2007, 2011, and \n2015; and 12 delinquent debts totaling approximately $36,900. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.o) These \nbankruptcies and debts are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions in her November 2022 \nsecurity clearance application (SCA), her admissions in her SOR Answer and at her \nhearing, and her credit reports. It was also alleged that in April 2014, Applicant was \narrested, charged, and convicted of embezzling approximately $150,000; and in 2006, \nshe was charged and convicted of passing insufficient fund checks. (SOR \u00b6 1.p) These \nallegations are established by her admissions in her Answer and at her hearing. (See \nfurther discussion below, under Criminal Conduct regarding the embezzlement and \npassing bad checks allegations.) \nApplicant stated that her financial difficulties arose because her husband was not \na steady income earner and because she was incarcerated for a year and was unable to \nwork. Her most recent debts accrued from her marriage and subsequent divorce. Her \n2007 bankruptcy was closed because Applicant did not compete a required financial \nmanagement course, and her 2011 petition was dismissed for failing to appear at the \ncreditors meeting. (Tr. 36-38; GE 5-6) \nApplicant\u2019s 2007 bankruptcy petition listed total liabilities of approximately $25,500 \nand total assets of $6,000.

Her 2015 bankruptcy petition listed total \nliabilities of approximately $75,000 and total assets of $0. Her dischargeable debts listed \nin this petition were discharged in March 2016. (GE 5-7) \nApplicant presented documentation showing that the debts listed at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j, \n1.k, and 1.o were paid through a settlement. Those debts are resolved. (Tr. 39, 41-42; \nAE A-B, Q) \nApplicant filed her most recent Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in December 2023. \nThis petition was not alleged in the SOR, but was offered as evidence by Applicant to \nshow that her remaining SOR debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.i and 1.l-1.n) have been included in \nthis petition. Her total liabilities listed in this petition amounted to approximately $73,000; \nand her total assets listed were approximately $24,500. She also listed her total monthly \nnet income as $4,386 and her total monthly expenses as $4,326, leaving a monthly \nremainder of $60. There was no evidence presented that this petition was finalized or that \nthe debts were discharged. I will not consider this 2023 bankruptcy petition for \ndisqualification purposes, but I may consider it in assessing mitigation and in applying the \nwhole-person factors. (Tr. 38-42; AE F-G) \nEvidence admitted at hearing also documented that Applicant has had 10 liens \nfiled against her, the three most recent occurring in 2016 (small claims judgment-$22); \n2019 (civil judgment-$10,809); and 2020 (small claims judgment-$1,000). In December \n2023, Applicant established a payment plan with the IRS for unpaid federal income taxes \nfor tax year 2021 in the amount of approximately $9,800. She has made one payment \nunder the plan. I will not consider the liens or federal tax debt for disqualification purposes, \nbut I may consider them in assessing mitigation and in applying the whole-person factors. \n(Tr.61; GE 8; AE C-D) \nDrug Involvement \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged that Applicant sold marijuana from January \n2022 to at least February 2023. It also alleged that she picked marijuana leaves and sold \nmarijuana from August 2021 to at least December 2021. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.b) \nApplicant admitted this conduct, except for selling marijuana from August 2021 to \nat least December 2021. During this timeframe, she lived in a state that legalized \nmarijuana production and sale under state law. The state also regulated the growing and \nsale of marijuana within the state. Applicant obtained a marijuana license from the state \nand worked cultivating marijuana and later selling marijuana in state-regulated dispensary \nstores. While illegal under federal law, all her actions were legal under her state\u2019s law. \nHer marijuana license expired in August 2023 and she has not cultivated or sold \nmarijuana since that time.

It also alleged she was convicted of passing \ninsufficient funds checks in 2006. \nBefore 2014, Applicant was employed as a financial secretary to a local union. She \ntook out some loans from union funds. She paid back the first of such loans. She took out \nadditional loans to pay her monthly expenses. She was terminated because she missed \ntoo many workdays caring for her sick mother. She did not pay back the loans. She \ntestified that the unpaid loans totaled approximately $14,000 to $16,000. After she was \nterminated a federal investigation occurred and she was deemed responsible for \nmisappropriating approximately $150,000. In 2014, she ultimately pleaded guilty to the \nembezzlement charge and was sentenced to a year incarceration in federal prison, two \nyears\u2019 probation, and ordered to pay restitution to the union. So far, she documented \npaying back approximately $32,000, leaving approximately $121,000 remaining. She \ncompleted her incarceration and her two-year probation period. She claimed to take \nresponsibility for her actions, but she also stated she did not take all the money alleged. \n(Tr. 43, 45-47, 49-51, 67; GE 2; AE P; SOR Answer) \nApplicant admitted passing bad checks in 2006. She blamed her actions on being \nyoung and unsophisticated with the way checks worked. Her mother did not educate her \non the process. She made restitution. (Tr. 43; GE 2; SOR Answer) \nApplicant\u2019s Mitigation. \nApplicant presented her 2022 and 2023 annual appraisals. She was rated as an \noverall strong performer for both years. Eight current or former coworkers wrote character \nletters supporting Applicant. They described her dedication to the job and her excellent \nperformance. Several commented on her trustworthiness and many recommended \ngranting her a security clearance. Applicant did not advise any of them about her past \ncriminal or financial circumstances. (Tr. 70; AE I-L, N-O, S-T) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-\n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, employee \ntheft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing deceptive \nloan statements and other intentional financial breaches of trust. \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties extend back to 2007, when she first filed for \nChapter 7 bankruptcy protection. That petition was closed without completion. She also \nfiled in 2011, but that petition was dismissed. Her liabilities far outnumbered her assets \nlisted in both petitions. In 2015, she filed under Chapter 7 and her debts were discharged. \nSince then, she has accumulated approximately $36,000 worth of delinquent debts, listed \nin the SOR, which she included in her December 2023 Chapter 7 petition. She was \nconvicted of passing bad checks in 2006 and embezzling over $150,000 from her \nemployer in 2015. I find the above disqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;    \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are numerous and ongoing. She has demonstrated a long history \nof financial irresponsibility dating back to her first dismissed Chapter 7 bankruptcy in \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2007. Her filing of another Chapter 7 in December 2023 is the most recent example of \nher inability to pay her debts. While bankruptcy is a legal means to rid someone of past \ndebts, its use to resolve debts does nothing to assure a person\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nWhile the accumulation of some of the Applicant\u2019s SOR debt may have been \nbeyond her control because of her husband\u2019s lack of income production and her divorce, \nher crime of embezzlement, which sent her to jail for a year, was certainly within her \ncontrol. Additionally, aside from recently settling three SOR debts and including the rest \nin her bankruptcy petition, she has not acted responsibly in trying to resolve her financial \nproblems. She still has unresolved liens and she just recently established a payment plan \nwith the IRS for past-due taxes. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nApplicant received financial counseling, but there are no clear indications that her \nfinancial problems are being resolved. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. \nAside from the three settled debts, and attempting to discharge her remaining \ndebts through bankruptcy, she has not demonstrated a good-faith effort to resolve her \ndebts. Even the $32,000 in restitution payments she has made are court ordered and \nmore akin to an involuntary garnishment than a good-faith effort to repay. AG \u00b6 20(d) has \nsome application. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. One that is potentially applicable in this case is: \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant cultivated marijuana from August 2021 to December 2021, and sold it \nfrom January 2022 to February 2023. AG \u00b6 25(c) applies. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. One potentially \napplies in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \nApplicant cultivated and sold marijuana during the timeframe indicated while duly \nauthorized by state law to do so. Her license to do so expired in August 2023 and she \nhas not cultivated or sold marijuana since then. AG \u00b6 26(a) applies. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for criminal conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following is potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \nApplicant convictions for passing bad checks in 2006 and embezzlement in 2014 \nestablish the above condition. \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for criminal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 32 and considered the following relevant: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nBoth of Applicant\u2019s crimes are somewhat dated, 2006 for the bad check charge \nand 2014 for the embezzlement offense. However, both crimes involved dishonest acts. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEven more troubling is that she embezzled over $150,000 from her employer. She \npleaded guilty to that charge, but she also seemed to waffle during her testimony about \nher actual guilt, thus failing to totally accept responsibility for her actions. She successfully \ncompleted her probation, but she still remains obligated to pay restitution. While some \naspects of the above mitigating conditions are present, overall they are not controlling \nhere. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s character letters \nand her performance appraisals. \nOverall the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guidelines F and J. She \nmitigated the concerns under Guideline H. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.i, 1.k-1.n, 1.p: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j - 1.k, 1.o: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a -2.b: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a \u2013 3.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Government Exhibit 1.) On June 9, 2023, the \nDepartment of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security concerns under Guideline F \n(Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nAdjudicative Guidelines effective within the Department of Defense after June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing (Answer) on June 13, 2023, and requested \na hearing before an administrative judge. He also attached two documents to his Answer, \nhereafter identified as Applicant Exhibits A through C. Department Counsel was prepared \nto proceed on July 12, 2023. The case was assigned to me on July 14, 2023. The Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Hearing on July 19, 2023. The \ncase was heard on September 12, 2023. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing \non September 21, 2023. \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 6, which were admitted \nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. He asked that the record remain \nopen for the receipt of additional documentation. Applicant timely submitted Applicant \nExhibits D through J , which were also admitted without objection, and the record closed \non September 25, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 32 years old and engaged. He has an ex-wife, with whom he had a \nminor child. Records show he is current on his child-support obligations. He is a high \nschool graduate and has training as a truck driver. He has been employed by his current \ndefense contractor employer since March 2022 and seeks to obtain national security \neligibility and a security clearance in connection with his employment. He had previously \nbeen granted an interim security clearance that was revoked because of the pendency of \nthis proceeding. This is his first position with the defense industry. (Government Exhibit 1 \nat Sections 13A, and 17; Government Exhibit 3 at 4; Applicant Exhibit G; Tr. 7, 17-18.) \nApplicant has been working as a truck driver for various companies for about eight \nyears. His salary had been steadily increasing as he took new jobs. He was earning \napproximately $72,000 annually at his current employer when he held an interim \nclearance. His salary has decreased now that he no longer has an interim clearance, \nthough he is still employed. (Government Exhibit 1 at Section 13A; Tr. 17-22.) \nStarting in March 2022, when he obtained his current employment and began \nmaking more money, he began paying the debts one at a time. This includes at least ten \npast-due or delinquent debts that were not included in the SOR. (Government Exhibit 2 \nat 13-15; Government Exhibit 3 at 10, 16; Government Exhibit 4 at 4-5; Tr. 31, 47, 75-\n76.) \nApplicant also retained a credit repair company to assist him with resolving his \npast-due debts. It appears the company succeeded in having several debts removed from \nhis credit report, but they did not otherwise negotiate with the creditors to resolve his \ndebts.

Applicant \nadmitted all the allegations under this guideline with explanations. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had eight charged-off or past-due consumer debts \nin the total amount of approximately $49,226. The existence and amount of the debts is \nsupported by credit reports dated March 9, 2022; December 8, 2022; and July 12, 2023. \nThey are also supported by Applicant\u2019s statements to an investigator from the Office of \nPersonnel Management on March 28, 2022; and his responses to interrogatories issued \nto him by the DoD CAF on September 27, 2022, which included a credit report also dated \nSeptember 27, 2022. (Government Exhibits 2, 3, 4, 5; and 6.) \nThe current status of the debts is as follows: \n1.a. Applicant admitted that he owed $39,111 for a collection account connected \nto a medical bill. This is Applicant\u2019s largest debt. This debt was incurred due to a five-day \nhospitalization of Applicant in approximately May 2021. (Applicant testified that he \nbelieved this hospitalization was in 2020, but documentary evidence in the record shows \nit to have been in 2021.) He had just started with a new employer and his insurance had \nnot yet begun when he was hospitalized on an emergency basis for COVID. He was in \nthe hospital five days and discharged himself against medical advice once he was told by \nthe hospital that he would have to cover all the cost himself. He was not eligible for \nMedicaid because he was employed and made too much money. He has tried to find \nprograms that will assist him, but he finds the online forms too confusing for him to fill out \non his own. He also contacted a lawyer whose advice was provided through his \nemployment. Finally, in his post-hearing submission he stated that he has reached out to \nthe creditor and is attempting to settle the debt. (Applicant Exhibit D; Tr. 47-69, 77-79.) \nThis debt is not resolved, but I find Applicant is making a good-faith attempt to resolve it. \n1.b. Applicant admitted that he owed $4,373 for a charged-off account with a credit \ncard company. He is unable to resolve this debt due to his loss of income, but he intends \nto pay it as soon as possible. (Tr. 31, 70-71.) This debt is not resolved, but I find Applicant \nis making a good-faith attempt to resolve it. \n1.c. Applicant admitted that he owed $2,082 for a charged-off account with a credit \ncard company. He is unable to resolve this debt due to his loss of income, but he intends \nto pay it as soon as possible. (Tr. 31, 70-71.) This debt is not resolved, but I find Applicant \nis making a good-faith attempt to resolve it. \n1.d. Applicant admitted that he owed a charged-off debt to a bank in the amount \nof $1,490. He is unable to resolve this debt due to his loss of income, but he intends to \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npay it as soon as possible.

Applicant admitted that he owed a past-due debt for a mobile telephone bill in\nthe amount of $656. He reached a payment arrangement with the creditor and paid the \ndebt off in May 2023, as shown in documentation from the collection agency. (Applicant \nExhibit A; Tr. 29-31.) This debt is resolved. \n1.f. Applicant admitted that he owed $655 for a collection account with a credit card \ncompany. He testified that he had paid the debt. In his post-hearing submissions he stated \nthat he was incorrect. However, he contacted the creditor and made an arrangement to \npay a lesser amount over several months. He also submitted documentation showing that \nhe had made an initial payment in accordance with his agreement. (Applicant Exhibits D \nand E; Tr. 33.) This debt is being resolved. \n1.g. Applicant admitted that he owed $542 for a charged-off account with a \ndepartment store. He is unable to resolve this debt due to his loss of income, but he \nintends to pay it as soon as possible. (Tr. 31, 70-71.) This debt is not resolved, but I find \nApplicant is making a good-faith attempt to resolve it. \n1.h. Applicant admitted that he owed a past-due medical debt in the amount of \n$317. Applicant stated in his Answer that this debt was paid. This was not correct. He \nintends to pay this debt as soon as possible. (Tr. 30-31, 70-71.) This debt is not resolved, \nbut I find that Applicant is making a good faith attempt to resolve it. \nApplicant\u2019s current financial status is stable. Other than the accounts described \nabove he has no delinquent debt. He is able to pay his current debts without difficulty. (Tr. \n69-70.) \nMitigation \nThree of Applicant\u2019s supervisors provided statements on Applicant\u2019s behalf. His \nmanager stated, \u201c[Applicant] has an exceptional performance record and works well with \nhis peers and customers.\u201d(Applicant Exhibit G.) His associate manager stated, \u201cIn \n[Applicant\u2019s] 1.5 years of service I have never questioned his integrity.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit \nH.) Finally, his planner supervisor stated, \u201c[Applicant] has upheld all his duties in the \nstrongest reliable way possible, he has operated within the confines of the laws of our \nstate & country.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit J.) \nA friend of Applicant\u2019s stated, \u201cFrom work to his personal life, he [Applicant] is\nalways willing to help whoever is in need.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline F, Financial Considerations) \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG \u00b6 18, which reads in pertinent part: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had eight past-due or charged-off debts at the time the SOR was issued. \nThese facts establish prima facie support for the foregoing disqualifying conditions, and \nshift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \nThe guideline includes three conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alleged financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial situation deteriorated severely in 2021 when he was \nhospitalized for COVID. This was during a period when he did not have health insurance \nbecause he was a new hire. Unfortunately for him the insurance began two weeks after \nhis discharge. In fact, to reduce the amount of debt he was incurring he left the hospital \nagainst medical advice. As set forth at length above he has been attempting to find a way \nto resolve this debt without success. \nHowever, with regard to other debts, once Applicant reached a point of financial \nstability with his defense contractor employer, he began to pay his debts. He submitted \nsufficient documentation to support his written statements and testimony that he had paid \nat least eleven debts before issuance of the SOR. He has acted responsibly in settling \nthese debts and evinces a credible intent to resolve all of his debts in a reasonable and \nresponsible manner. His current employment provides sufficient means for him to do it. \nIn reviewing the available evidence, I find that all of the mitigating conditions cited \nhere apply. Paragraph 1 (Financial Considerations) is found for Applicant. \nIn support of these findings, I cite the Appeal Board\u2019s decision in ISCR Case No.\n07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) for the proposition that the adjudicative guidelines\ndo not require that an applicant be debt-free. The Board\u2019s guidance for adjudications in\ncases such as this is the following: \n. . . an applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that \nhe has paid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is \nthat an applicant demonstrate that he has established a plan to resolve his \nfinancial problems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The \nJudge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s \nplan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and \nrealistic. There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all \noutstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and \nconcomitant conduct) may provide for the payments of such debts one at a \ntime. (Internal citations and quotation marks omitted.) \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s potential for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has mitigated the \nconcerns regarding his past-due indebtedness. He has minimized both the potential for \npressure or duress, and the likelihood of continuing or recurring financial issues. Overall, \nthe record evidence does not create substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability \nfor national security eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nWILFORD H. ROSS \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

(Tr. 7-10, 25-29; GE 5) \nApplicant attributed all of the bankruptcies alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.f, due \nto excessive medical expenses incurred from his former spouse whom he married in May \n1998 and divorced in April 2017. She was unable to work during periods when she \nsuffered with medical issues, which also contributed to their financial troubles. His most \nrecent Chapter 13 filing showed many medical debts, but also federal and state tax \ndelinquencies, secured debts, and unpaid personal loans and credit cards. The \nbankruptcy was discharged in July 2022. In addition, while the September 2004 Chapter \n13 bankruptcy was in process, Applicant was charged with stealing funds from the \nFraternal Order of Police (FOP) in his role as treasurer, as set forth below. (Answer; GE \n1-10; Tr. 25-28, 40-42) \nUnder Guideline E, SOR \u00b6 2.g alleges that in 2005, while Applicant was employed \nby the Sheriff\u2019s office, he stole $3,500 from funds belonging to the FOP in his role as \ntreasurer. In November 2007, he was sentenced to 18 months in jail, suspended, 18 \nmonths of probation, plus restitution and community service. Applicant retired from the \nSheriff\u2019s office after this incident. Applicant testified that he had borrowed approximately \n$6,000 from the FOP by writing checks to himself that were countersigned by another \nFOP member. Applicant stated that \u201cborrowing funds\u201d was a common practice of past \nFOP treasurers. A public audit of the FOP books was requested. Applicant claimed the \nFOP did not want to press charges against him since they were already aware he had \nwritten four unauthorized checks to himself. The FOP understood he was going to pay \nback the money after he received his tax refund. The sheriff, however, believed this was \na serious breach of fiduciary duty and wanted the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) \nand state police to become involved in the inquiry. Charges were filed, and during \nApplicant\u2019s criminal trial, he admitted to the theft of FOP funds. He said he was in the \nmiddle of a Chapter 13 bankruptcy making payments to a trustee, his wife was working \nminimal hours, and they were struggling to make ends meet. He acknowledged that he \nmade a mistake and took responsibility for his poor decisions. He provided a copy of a \nMay 2015 expungement order (AE C), and he stated in his Answer, \u201c\u2026attached is the \nexpungement order that erases this MINOR infraction from my criminal history.\u201d (Answer; \nTr. 29-37) \nIn February 2022, Applicant hired a consumer debt relief company to deal with his \ngrowing debt, and he completed his SCA in May 2022. He was to make monthly payments \nto the consumer debt relief program who would then negotiate with his creditors for lower \ninterest rates, or obtain settlement offers. He was told that after six months in the program, \nhe would be able to get a loan to consolidate his debt. He admitted that after six months, \nthe debt relief program informed him that he did not qualify for the consolidation loan. He \nwas also informed that the debt relief program could take five years to fully resolve his \noverall debt. Applicant now regrets that he hired the consumer debt relief program, but \nhe signed a contract and is committed with the program until the end.

Applicant \ndenied this allegation. (Answer; GE 1, 2; Tr. 62-64) \nSOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant falsified his August 2022 background interview \nwith an authorized DOD investigator when he denied that in the last seven years, he had \never received a written warning, been officially reprimanded, suspended, or disciplined \nfor misconduct in the workplace. The investigator provided Applicant an opportunity to \ndiscuss if anything had happened of that nature with his current employer, or if there was \nanything he did not disclose on the SCA that he wanted to remedy. Applicant was asked \nthis question three times by the investigator, and all three times his response was \u201cNo.\u201d \nThe investigator then confronted Applicant with dates of recorded misconduct at his \ncurrent place of employment. (Answer; GE 1, 2; Tr. 64-68) \nIn Applicant\u2019s Answer, he stated: \nI did not knowingly falsify my e-QIP [SCA]. If I had known that these records \nwere still in my file and active, I would have entered them into the e-QIP. I \nwas taken [a]back by the investigator\u2019s questions because he asked me if I \nfalsified the e-QIP regarding discipline and I stated no, why, because I was \ncleared of the allegations, given my money back from the suspensions and \nthinking that these allegations were taken out of my permanent personnel \nfile.  \nAccording to Applicant\u2019s January 2024 response to interrogatories, after he was \nconfronted by the investigator with four separate instances of workplace misconduct \nduring his August 2022 background interview, he told the investigator that he did not list \nthese workplace incidents for two reasons: 1) He was told by management that the \ndisciplinary actions would come out of his personnel record after one year, and 2) he was \nunaware that these infractions remained in his record, or else he would have provided the \ninformation voluntarily on the SCA and during the background interview.  (GE 2) \nDuring the hearing Applicant stated that he misunderstood the SCA question, \nwhich differs from the explanation provided to the DOD investigator. In his Answer and \nduring the hearing Applicant also claimed that he had been cleared by his employer of \nany wrong-doing, which he also did not tell the investigator. He stated that, in essence, it \nwas like the misconduct \u201cdidn\u2019t happen.\u201d He provided a collective bargaining agreement \nbetween his employer and employees, which, in part, discussed workplace misconduct. \nHe was made aware that the collective bargaining agreement was between his employer \nand employees, and it did not include or prohibit the federal government from fully \ninvestigating potential individuals in process for national security eligibility.

(Tr. 62-64, 71) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .   \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19: \n(a) Inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has experienced financial difficulties for over two decades. He attributed \nhis financial problems to his ex-wife\u2019s medical issues, her reduced work schedule, and an \naccumulation of medical bills, which is a situation largely beyond his control, establishing \nthe first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b). For full mitigation credit, he must prove that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. \nApplicant\u2019s track record of not paying his financial obligations is evidenced by \nmultiple bankruptcies over the past 20 years. His most recent Chapter 13 bankruptcy \nshowed several unpaid medical debts, but there were also federal and state tax \ndelinquencies, secured debts, and unpaid personal loans and credit cards. The \nbankruptcy was discharged in July 2022. What is concerning is that before his Chapter \n13 bankruptcy was discharged, in February 2022, Applicant hired a consumer debt relief \nprogram to help him with his current accumulation of mounting debt. Using a consumer \ndebt relief program can be a favorable consideration, however, the timing of his accrual \nof additional debt is also relevant. He was divorced in 2017 from his ex-wife suffering with \nmedical issues, and his ongoing financial problems occurred well after his divorce. It is \nclear that Applicant\u2019s overspending and poor financial decisions have a role in his \nfinancial troubles. \nApplicant\u2019s irresponsible spending habits are current, ongoing, and recent. He \ntestified that he resolved one SOR debt and half of the other SOR debt through his \nconsumer debt relief program, but the largest debt in the SOR, totaling over $17,000, has \nnot been resolved nor is it currently being paid. Applicant and his wife together make over \n$200,000 annually. Given Applicant\u2019s lengthy history of financial issues, I find that more \ntime is required for him to demonstrate that he is responsible, his finances are under \ncontrol, and that his monetary problems are unlikely to recur. Mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n20(a), 20(b), and 20(d) was not established. Applicant failed to mitigate the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or \nadjudicative processes. . . .  \nAG \u00b6 16 lists the following personal conduct conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying as follows: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative; and \ncredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of . . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty \nor rule violations. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) are established. The record evidence shows that Applicant \ndeliberately did not disclose several instances of work-related misconduct on the May \n2022 SCA and during his August 2022 background interview, as required. AG \u00b6 16(d) \npartially applies since most, but not all, of the adverse information is not explicitly covered \nunder any other guideline. AG \u00b6 16(d)(3) is also applicable due to Applicant\u2019s admissions. \nThe record shows that he had five separate incidents of workplace misconduct, to include \na 2007 criminal conviction, which supports a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom personal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;   \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully;                                                                           \n(c) the offense is so minor or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n (d): \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                       \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. I did not find Applicant\u2019s testimony \ncredible. He provided conflicting reasons why he did not disclose the four instances of \nworkplace misconduct on the SCA and during his background interview. He testified that \nhe had been cleared by his employer of the reprimands and therefore, the records were \nno longer in his personnel file. He stated that, in essence, it seemed to him like the \nmisconduct never happened. He also stated during the hearing that he misunderstood \nthe SCA question. During his August 2022 background investigation, however, Applicant \ntold the investigator that he did not think that the disciplinary records remained in his \npersonnel file following one year, but if he had known the government would find out \nabout his workplace misconduct, he would have disclosed it. \nApplicant did not make prompt, good-faith efforts to correct his deliberate \nomissions during the course of the security clearance investigation, and he failed to \nprovide any corroborating evidence to support his claims that he was ultimately cleared \nof any wrong-doing at his workplace. His testimony that he borrowed money from the \nFOP in his position as treasurer is also very troubling, especially considering that he was \nexperiencing financial difficulties at the time. His pattern of dishonesty and workplace \nmisconduct casts doubt on his overall reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nPersonal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my \nwhole-person analysis.  \nThe SOR highlights a pattern of financial irresponsibility, workplace misconduct, \nand Applicant\u2019s behavior of trying to hide relevant and material information that the \ngovernment requires to properly evaluate whether an individual possesses the integrity \nand good character required to protect our nation\u2019s secrets. I conclude that he has not \nmitigated the financial considerations and personal conduct security concerns. \nAccordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g and 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.g: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest of the United \nStates to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nPamela C.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all the SOR allegations. Her admissions are incorporated into the finding of facts. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 28 years old and a high school graduate. She has a two-year-old child. She has worked at various jobs and has been approved for a job with a federal contractor pending the approval of a security clearance. (Item 2) In June 2022, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA). In July 2022, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. In June 2023, Applicant completed government interrogatories and affirmed her summary of enhanced interview and did not have any corrections. (Items 2, 3) From 2016 to February 2022, Applicant used and purchased marijuana. In January 2019, she obtained a medical marijuana card from her state. Before that date she did not have the card. She stated in her interview with the government investigator that she used marijuana beginning in 2016 multiple times to relieve post-traumatic stress. She did not provide any medical records confirming a diagnosis. She purchased the marijuana on the street and estimated she smoked about 14 ounces a week.

The \nGovernment\u2019s evidence is identified as Items 1 through 9. Applicant did not respond to \nthe FORM, provide documentary evidence, or object to the Government\u2019s evidence. Items \n1 through 9 are admitted in evidence. The case was assigned to me on February 27, \n2024. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations. Her admissions are incorporated into \nthe finding of facts. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 28 years old and a high school graduate. She has a two-year-old child. \nShe has worked at various jobs and has been approved for a job with a federal contractor \npending the approval of a security clearance. (Item 2) \nIn June 2022, Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA). In July \n2022, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. In June 2023, Applicant \ncompleted government interrogatories and affirmed her summary of enhanced interview \nand did not have any corrections. (Items 2, 3) \nFrom 2016 to February 2022, Applicant used and purchased marijuana. In January \n2019, she obtained a medical marijuana card from her state. Before that date she did not \nhave the card. She stated in her interview with the government investigator that she used \nmarijuana beginning in 2016 multiple times to relieve post-traumatic stress. She did not \nprovide any medical records confirming a diagnosis. She purchased the marijuana on the \nstreet and estimated she smoked about 14 ounces a week. After receiving her medical \nmarijuana card in January 2019, she purchased it at state dispensaries where it was legal \nunder state law. She smoked it weekly. She told the investigator that she stopped using \nmarijuana in February 2022. In response to questions in the interrogatories, she stated \nthat she last used marijuana in January 2022, and she did not intend to use it in the future. \nShe did not provide a response to the FORM that she received in November 2023 to \nupdate or corroborate that she is no longer a marijuana user. (Items 2, 3) \nIn June 2019, Applicant was arrested and charged with driving under the influence \n(DUI) of liquor .15% or greater, 1st offense. She pleaded nolo contendere. She was \nsentenced to one-year probation, twenty hours of community service, 45 days hardship \nlicense, fines and fees. She was ordered to attend DUI school and to use an ignition \ninterlock system for nine months. From August 2019 to September 2020, Applicant \nattended court-ordered treatment. In her interview with a government investigator, she \nadmitted she had consumed alcohol before her arrest. She said she satisfied the \nconditions of her sentence.

The charged was dismissed and \ndocketed as non-trial disposition. (Items 3, 7) \nIn May 2022, Applicant was charged with DUI of liquor, blood alcohol concentration \nunknown, 2nd offense. This case was dismissed by the prosecution and docketed for \nnon-trial disposition. She was also charged in May 2022 for Refusal to Submit to Chemical \nTest. She was found guilty of the charge and sentenced to 10 hours of community service, \na 30-day license suspension and ordered to attend DUI treatment with random alcohol \ntesting and use an ignition interlock system for 24 months. During her interview with a \ngovernment investigator, she admitted consuming alcohol before her arrest. She admitted \nthat she refused to take a breathalyzer and pleaded guilty to that charge. At the time of \nher interview, she had not started her community service and did not provide any updated \ninformation as to whether she has completed it. The date of her sentence was June 3, \n2022. She is required to use the ignition interlock system until June 2024. She told the \ngovernment investigator that in July 2022, she began her court-ordered alcohol treatment. \nNo information was provided as to whether she completed the treatment, received a \ndiagnosis, or prognosis. She also told the investigator that she does not intend to \nconsume alcohol in the future or will only consume very little in the future. (Items 3, 4, 5) \nIn response to questions in the government interrogatories that asked her about \npast alcohol and drug use, specifically how often she consumes alcohol beverages in an \naverage week and to describe the amount, size, and type, Applicant failed to provide any \nanswer. She did respond to the questions about her past drug use. (Item 3) \nThe SOR alleges three delinquent debts that Applicant admitted to in her answer \nand are supported by credit reports from June 2022 and June 2023. Applicant told the \ngovernment investigator that the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.a ($309), 4.b ($576) and 4.c ($926) \nwere all resolved. She admitted she stopped paying the three debts because she did not \nhave the money at the time because she had a new baby, but later settled or paid them \nin either 2019 or 2020 and has no further obligation to the creditors. Her baby was born \nin December 2021. She did not provide proof that she has resolved any of the debts. All \nthree are reported as charged off and the last activity for SOR \u00b6 4.a was September 2018 \nand the last payments for SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.b and 4.c were in August 2018. The debts are \nunresolved. (Items 1, 2, 3, 8, 9) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concerns for alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.  \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following to be potentially applicable: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nApplicant was arrested and charged with DUI .15% or greater, 1st offense in June \n2019. She pleaded nolo contendere and was sentenced to one year probation, 20 hours \nof community service, a 45-day hardship license, fines and fees. She was ordered to \nattend DUI school and use an ignition interlock system for nine months. She attended \ncourt-ordered treatment from August 2019 to September 2020. She was arrested and \ncharged in May 2022 for DUI of liquor blood alcohol content unknown. She was charged \nwith refusal to submit to a chemical test. The DUI was dismissed. She was found guilty \nof refusal to submit to a chemical test, sentenced to 10 hours of community service, a 30-\nday license suspension, ordered to attend DUI treatment, and use an ignition interlock \nsystem for 24 months. In July 2022, Applicant received court-ordered alcohol treatment. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) applies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom alcohol consumption. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \n\u00b6 23: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations;  \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and  \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations.  \nApplicant had DUI arrests in 2019 and 2022. Despite participating in court-ordered \nalcohol treatment after her 2019 arrest and conviction, she again consumed alcohol and \nwas arrested for DUI. She refused the breathalyzer and was ultimately found guilty of \nrefusal to submit to a chemical test. She did not provide any evidence about a diagnosis \nor prognosis after completing her 2019 treatment. She did not provide evidence that she \nhas completed the alcohol treatment ordered by the court after her 2022 conviction, which \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwas part of her sentence. She is subject to using an ignition interlock system until June \n2024, indicating the court has concerns that she could attempt to drink and drive again. \nShe told the government investigator during her July 2022 interview that she was going \nto either abstain from alcohol consumption or drink very little. She failed to respond to \ngovernment interrogatories about her current alcohol consumption, which is a concern. \nShe has not provided sufficient evidence to find there is a clear and established pattern \nof modified consumption or abstinence. She did not provide evidence that she is currently \nparticipating in counseling or has completed a treatment program. She continues to be \nunder a court mandate to use an ignition interlock system. Insufficient time has passed, \nand her conduct did not happen under unique circumstances that is unlikely to recur. Her \nconduct cast doubts on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. None \nof the mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant used and purchased marijuana from 2016 to February 2022. She said \nshe obtained a medical marijuana card from her state in January 2019 and purchased \nand used it legally under her state laws. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 are potentially \napplicable: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant used marijuana from 2016 to 2019 and purchased it from the street. In \nJanuary 2019, she said she obtained a medical marijuana card and purchased it from a \nstate dispensary, where it was legal. She did not produce the medical marijuana card. \nApplicant told a government investigator in July 2022 that she no longer used marijuana \nand did not intend to do so in the future. In her June 2023 interrogatories, she said her \nlast use was January 2022, six months before she completed her SCA. Because \nApplicant requested a determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity \nto question her about his illegal drug use, any current use, or evaluate her credibility and \nsincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, \n2003). I cannot determine if future behavior is unlikely to recur or if she understands that \nher use of marijuana might be legal under state law but it remains illegal under federal \nlaw. The above mitigating conditions do not apply. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 31, and the following is \npotentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn June 2019, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI of liquor .15% or \ngreater, 1st offense. She pleaded nolo contendere. She was sentenced to one year \nprobation, 20 hours of community service, a 45-day hardship license, fines and fees. She \nwas ordered to attend DUI school and use an ignition interlock system for nine months. \nIn \nOctober \n2019, \nshe \nwas \narrested \nand \ncharged \nwith \ndriving \nwith \na \nsuspended/revoked/cancelled license, 1st offense. The charge was dismissed and \ndocketed as a non-trial court disposition. In May 2022, she was arrested for DUI-blood \nalcohol concentration unknown. She was charged with Refusal to Submit to Chemical \nTest. The DUI charge was dismissed and docketed as a non-trial disposition. She was \nfound guilty of Refusal to Submit to Chemical Test. She was sentenced to 10 hours of \ncommunity service, a 30-day license suspension, ordered to attend DUI treatment and \nuse an ignition interlock system for 24 months, which ends in June 2024. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom criminal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant was arrested in 2019 for DUI, attended treatment, and then was arrested \nfor driving with a suspended/revoked/canceled license months later. That charge was \ndismissed and adjudicated in a non-trial disposition. She was then arrested for another \nDUI in May 2022. She refused the breathalyzer. She was convicted of that charge. She \ndid not provide evidence that she completed the terms of her sentence. At the time of her \ninterview, she had not completed her community service. She is required by the court to \nuse an ignition interlock system until June 2024. Not enough time has elapsed to conclude \nfuture criminal behavior is unlikely to recur or her conduct happened under unique \ncircumstances. Her repeated criminal conduct casts doubt on her reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. The above mitigating conditions do not apply. \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant admitted the three delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. They became \ndelinquent in 2018. There is sufficient evidence to support the application of the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the\nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit\ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control; and \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant admitted the three delinquent debts alleged in the SOR. They are recent, \nongoing, and unresolved. She told the government investigator that she was unable to \npay them at the time because she had a new baby. The debts became delinquent in \nAugust 2018, three years before her child was born. She said that she settled or paid all \nthree debts. She did not provide any documentary proof to show a good-faith effort that \nthe debts are resolved. They are reported as charged off on her 2022 and 2023 credit \nreports. Although she may not have had the means to resolve the debts in 2018, she did \nnot provide sufficient evidence to show that the debts were caused by matters beyond \nher control, and she subsequently acted responsibly. She did not provide evidence that \nshe has participated in financial counseling and her financial problems are being resolved. \nNone of the mitigating conditions are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines G, H, J, and F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant failed to meet her burden of persuasion. After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines G, H, J and F and evaluating all the evidence \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns under Guideline G, alcohol consumption, Guideline H, drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, Guideline J, criminal conduct, and Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 4.a-4.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Tr. 49-50) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b (cross-alleged under \u00b6 2.a): Applicant was charged in September 2016 \nwith operating vehicle while intxicated (OVI). He stated that during this time he worked \nfor a small family-owned heating and air conditioning company. One day the employees \ndid not have any scheduled work to perform, and the owner of the company offered to \npay his employees to come to his house and plant trees.

He \nwas found guilty of OVI, his driver\u2019s license was suspended, he was ordered to attend \nMothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) alcohol education meetings for a weekend, and \nhe was assessed fines and costs. (Tr. 29-33; GE 1 and 4) \nApplicant told the investigator during his August 2022 background interview that \nhe had consumed approximately six beers before his 2016 OVI arrest. He also told the \ninvestigator that he crashed his car after he tried avoiding a deer in the road. When asked \nabout this discrepancy during the hearing, Applicant stated he could not recall if he told \nthe investigator there was a deer, and he said that he was unable to recall if he even saw \na deer in the road before he crashed his car because he was intoxicated. (GE 4; Tr. 30-\n31) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a (cross-alleged under \u00b6 2.a): Applicant was arrested in January 2022 \nand charged with OVI, blood alcohol content (BAC) greater than 0.08% but less than \n0.17% (Applicant registered 0.139%) and speeding. He was convicted of physical control-\nreckless driving and the court ordered him to complete a substance abuse assessment, \npay a fine of $250 plus court costs, his driver\u2019s license was suspended until January 2023, \nand he was placed on one year of probation, which he successfully completed about a \nweek before his December 12, 2023 hearing. He stated that he drove his wife\u2019s car and \nwent to a friend\u2019s house to watch a playoff football game. Another friend in attendance \nwas supposed to drive him home, but his friend drank too much alcohol and got sick. He \nestimated that he may have consumed more than six beers during the game. After \nApplicant waited an hour-and-a-half to two hours at his friend\u2019s house to sober up, he \ndrove that night and was pulled over for speeding near his home. He was arrested for the \noffenses listed above. His attorney noted that some of the field sobriety tests were \nimproperly conducted by the police officer, so Applicant was able to plead to a lesser \noffense of physical control-reckless driving. Applicant stated he voluntarily attended 10 \nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings on his own because he \u201cfelt like it was time to start \nshaping [his] life up and getting [his] life together and quit drinking.\u201d He initially denied \nthat he was ordered by the court to attend AA meetings, but later during the hearing he \nadmitted he was court-orderd to attend 10 AA meetings. (Tr. 17-23, 27-29, 46; GE 1, 2 \nand 4) \nThe January 2022 police report reflected that Applicant had stated to the police \nofficer that he had last consumed alcohol 20 minutes before he was pulled over. The \npassenger in Applicant\u2019s car tested below the legal limit and was permitted to drive \nApplicant\u2019s car from the scene. (GE 2) When asked about this information during the \nhearing, Applicant stated that since his friend had gotten sick, he must have eliminated \nthe alcohol from his system which may be the reason why his friend registered below the \nlegal limit. Applicant could not explain why he told the officer he had last consumed \nalcohol 20 minutes before he was pulled over as compared to his testimony that he waited \nan hour-and-a-half to two hours at his friend\u2019s house before driving so that he could sober \nup. (Tr. 20-21, 44-45; GE 2) \nDuring his August 2022 background interview, Applicant stated that he had \nconsumed ten beers before his January 2022 arrest.

He testified that he drank \nbeer on Fridays and Saturdays, and he would consume anywhere from 6 to 12 beers \neach evening before he had his OVI [should be defined above] arrest in September 2016 \n(age 25). After that arrest, he did not drink and drive for about the first six months, but he \nslowly slipped back into his old drinking habits. He would drive under the influence of \nalcohol about once every month or two until his second OVI arrest in January 2022. Since \nthat incident, he has made positive lifestyle changes and no longer drinks and drives. He \nhas continued to drink alcohol to the present time, but only on holdays and family \ngatherings. His last use of alcohol occurred on Thanksgiving Day 2023. He stated that he \nnow consumes alcohol infrequently and in moderation. (GE 4; Tr. 39-42) \nDuring his August 2022 background interview, Applicant provided information \nabout his use of alcohol. He stated that between the age of 21 to January 2022 (age of \n30), he would consume a single six-pack of beer over the course of the weekend. He did \nnot get intoxicated from this level of alcohol use. He told the investigator that he got \nintoxicated one or two times a year with his friends. He stated it took 12 beers for him to \nbecome intoxicated. He is content with his life without alcohol. This information was \ninconsistent with his testimony. (GE 4) \nDuring the December 2023 hearing, Applicant stated that he has consumed \nalcohol on a few occasions since he had his August 2022 interview, but he has never \ndrank to excess. During the hearing he admitted that he violated the terms of his probation \nthat required total abstinence from alcohol while serving probation through early \nDecember 2023. He also stated that during his probation he had to undergo about five or \nsix urinalysis tests, and he always tested negative for alcohol and drugs. He stated that \nthe alcohol he consumed only stayed in his system a day or two, and that is why it was \nnot detected during his tests. He has control of his drinking and no longer gets intoxicated. \nThe last time he was intoxicated was in January 2022, the night of his arrest. (Tr. 24-25, \n28-29; GE 4) \nApplicant testified that the last AA meeting he attended was in October 2023. He \nstated he intends to continue his AA meetings because \u201cit's made [him] realize if [he] \ncontinue[s] down that path then it's not a good life to be going through after hearing all \nthese stories of what everyone goes through. And it's not the life that [he] want[s] to \nlive\u2026.\u201d He also admitted he received a court-ordered substance abuse assessment, but \nhe did not know any of the details of his evaluation. He stated he would try to obtain a \ncopy of the substance abuse assessment as well as substantiating documentation that \nhe successfully completed his probation in early December 2023. He would submit these \ndocuments while the record was held open. However, no documentation was received \nwhile the record was held open.

(Tr. 45) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions, which \nare useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states that an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.

Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that an adverse decision shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of \nthe applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 describes the security concern about alcohol consumption, \n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 22 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying as follows: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nand \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nThe record evidence establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), and 22(c). Applicant was involved \nin three alcohol-related offenses in 2011, 2016, and 2022. He had a substance abuse \nassessment following his January 2022 arrest, and he continued using alcohol in violation \nof the terms of his probation. \nAG \u00b6 23 lists three conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \n6 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; and \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program. \nApplicant was involved in two recent alcohol-related arrests where he registered \nalarmingly high BAC readings that were well above the legal limit. Following his January \n2022 offense, there was a court-ordered requirement that he abstain from using alcohol \nduring his probationary period, to which he agreed, and he was to obtain a substance \nabuse assessment. He failed to remain alcohol-free, as required, even though he was \nadministered urinalysis tests throughout his probation period. He claimed he successfully \ncompleted his probation about one week prior to his hearing. \nApplicant bears the burden of production and persuasion in mitigation. He failed to \nprovide supporting documentation of his successful completion of probation. He also did \nnot provide a copy of his recent substance abuse assessment. Without this evaluation, I \nam unable to determine whether Applicant was diagnosed with an alcohol-related \ndisorder, recommended to participate in additional substance abuse counseling or \ntreatment, or whether he was given a favorable assessment. \nApplicant also provided inconsistent information during the security clearance \nprocess that calls into question his credibility. I believe more time is needed to establish \nsuccessful rehabilitation. He admitted after his fist OVI arrest in 2016, he was able to \nmoderate his consumption of alcohol for awhile until he slid back into his old drinking \nhabits. In August 2022, he stated that he intended to abstain from alcohol. At some point \nafter that statement and while on probation, he changed his mind and started consuming \nalcohol. Overall, I find that Applicant failed to mitigate the alcohol consumption security \nconcerns. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern related to the criminal conduct guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 \n30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Three potentially apply: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n(d) violation or revocation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a \ncourt-mandated rehabilitation program. \nThe record evidence establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), 31(b), and 31(d). Applicant was involved \nin four alcohol or drug-related offenses in 2011, 2016, and 2022, and he continued to \nconsume alcohol in violation of his probation requirement. \nAG \u00b6 32 lists two conditions that could mitigate the security concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct is disconcerting and recent. He claimed that he was \njust released from probation a week before his hearing. Applicant did not submit any \nevidence of rehabilitation, such as proof that he fulfilled all of the court-ordered conditions, \nor that he is no longer on probation. \nThere is insufficient evidence in the record to demonstrate that Applicant\u2019s alcohol-\nrelated conduct will not recur. I find that more time is needed to ensure that he does not \nrepeat this behavior since he admitted he previously returned to his old drinking habits \nfollowing his 2016 arrest. Not enough time has passed to demonstrate he is fully \nrehabilitated. As such, his criminal behavior continues to cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. Applicant failed to establish mitigation under the \nabove mitigating conditions. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) \nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines G and J into my whole-person analysis. \nIn 2016 and 2022, Applicant was involved in two alcohol-related offenses with high \nreadings of BAC that were well above the legal limit. To his credit, he has reduced his \nconsumption of alcohol. He made a poor decision, however, to consume alcohol during \nhis period of probation which required he abstain from drinking. He did not provide \nsufficient documentation to mitigate the concerns in this case. Not enough time has \npassed to demonstrate that Applicant\u2019s excessive use of alcohol will not recur, and there \nis insufficient evidence in the record to show that he is successfully rehabilitated. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. As such, Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising under alcohol consumption and criminal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:    \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b and 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nNational security eligibility is denied. \nPamela C.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline H, the SOR alleged that between May 2017 and at least June 2023, Applicant used marijuana \u201cmultiple times a week\u201d (SOR 1.a); that between December 2017 and at least April 2023, he used hallucinogenic mushrooms (SOR 1.b); that he used LSD once in 2020 (SOR 1.c); and that he intends to continue his use of marijuana and hallucinogenic mushrooms (SOR 1.d). In addition to admitting each of those allegations, he provided the following statement: [M]y use of recreational drugs on my personal time in no way reflects upon my trustworthiness as a keeper of national secrets. I do not plan to change my lifestyle because that would be absurd, and directly contradictory to the first sentence of this statement. If the DOD wants a dog who has no personal principles, they can find one elsewhere. (FORM, Items 1 and 2) In addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, and based on my review of the information presented in the FORM, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 27-year-old employee of a federal contractor, for whom he has worked as a software engineer since June 2016. In his e-QIP, he disclosed the drug use listed in the SOR.

After reviewing the results of the \nensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Defense Counterintelligence and \nSecurity Agency (DCSA) could not determine that it was clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security for Applicant to have access to classified information. \nOn June 14, 2023, the DCSA issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts \nthat raise security concerns addressed under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubstance Misuse). The DCSA acted as required by Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a decision without \na hearing. As provided for by paragraph E3.1.7 of the Directive, Department Counsel for \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a File of Relevant Material \n(FORM) that Applicant received on August 9, 2023. The FORM proffered four exhibits \n(Items 1 \u2013 4) on which the Government relied to support the SOR allegations. Applicant \nhad 30 days from receipt of the FORM to object to any of the Government\u2019s exhibits or to \nprovide other additional information. He did not respond to the FORM, and he did not file \nany objections to the Government\u2019s exhibits within the allotted time. Accordingly, GX 1 \u2013 \n4 became part of the record, which closed on September 13, 2023. I received the case \nfor decision on November 15, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged that between May 2017 and at least June \n2023, Applicant used marijuana \u201cmultiple times a week\u201d (SOR 1.a); that between \nDecember 2017 and at least April 2023, he used hallucinogenic mushrooms (SOR 1.b); \nthat he used LSD once in 2020 (SOR 1.c); and that he intends to continue his use of \nmarijuana and hallucinogenic mushrooms (SOR 1.d). In addition to admitting each of \nthose allegations, he provided the following statement: \n[M]y use of recreational drugs on my personal time in no way reflects upon \nmy trustworthiness as a keeper of national secrets. I do not plan to change \nmy lifestyle because that would be absurd, and directly contradictory to the \nfirst sentence of this statement. If the DOD wants a dog who has no \npersonal principles, they can find one elsewhere. (FORM, Items 1 and 2) \nIn addition to the facts established by Applicant\u2019s admissions, and based on my \nreview of the information presented in the FORM, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 27-year-old employee of a federal contractor, for whom he has \nworked as a software engineer since June 2016. In his e-QIP, he disclosed the drug use \nlisted in the SOR. Specifically, he disclosed he was a regular (sometimes daily) and \nongoing user of marijuana, both by smoking and in edible form. He also disclosed he had \nused LSD on one occasion in 2020, but that he would not use it again because he did not \nhave a good experience with that drug. Finally, he disclosed that he had used \nhallucinogenic, or \u201cmagic,\u201d mushrooms in 2017 and 2018. During his personal subject \ninterview (PSI) with a government investigator in January 2023, and in a June 9, 2023, \nresponse to interrogatories propounded by DOHA Department Counsel, he confirmed \nand updated the information about his drug use provided in his e-QIP. Notably, he told \nthe investigator that he had purchased hallucinogenic mushrooms just before he \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsubmitted his e-QIP and that he had used them between then and the date of his PSI. \n(FORM, Items 3 and 4) \nThe drugs in question \u2013 marijuana containing tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), LSD, \nand hallucinogenic \u201cmagic\u201d mushrooms \u2013 are or contain federally controlled substances, \nthe unauthorized possession and use of which are criminal violations of the Controlled \nSubstances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801 et seq. During his PSI, he acknowledged his \nunderstanding that use of marijuana is still a violation of federal criminal law. Nonetheless, \nhe affirmed his intention to continue using marijuana and magic mushrooms. In response \nto Department Counsel\u2019s interrogatories, he stated he intends to continue using marijuana \nand hallucinogenic mushrooms because they are \u201cintegral to [his] artistic process.\u201d He \nhas not provided any details regarding what that process might entail. He also relies on \nthe fact that use and possession of marijuana are generally legal in the state where he \nlives. (FORM, Items 2 \u2013 4) \nGuidance issued by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (OASD) in \nFebruary 2013, which was updated by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) in \nDecember 2021, makes clear that changes in the laws pertaining to marijuana by the \nvarious states, territories, and the District of Columbia do not alter the current National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines. Because federal law supersedes state laws on this \nissue, Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana, regardless of location or even medical justification in \nhis state of residence, was illegal. Further, federal workplaces prohibit illegal drug use by \ncivilian federal employees and by persons employed for work on federal contracts. \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, \u00b6 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those \nfactors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988)) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAvailable information reasonably raises the security concern about drug \ninvolvement stated at AG \u00b6 24 as follows: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n25 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) any drug abuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture, \npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n \n \nIn response to the Government\u2019s information, Applicant did not provide any \ninformation that addresses any of the mitigating conditions presented under AG \u00b6 26. As \nof June 2023, he was still using marijuana on a regular basis, and he reaffirmed his \nintentions to continue using illegal drugs despite his clear understanding that his conduct \nis illegal. The security concerns raised by the Government\u2019s information are not mitigated. \nIn addition to my evaluation of the facts and my application of the appropriate \nadjudicative factors under Guideline H, I have reviewed the record before me in the \ncontext of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). In that context, it is difficult to \ndecide which is more concerning \u2013 Applicant\u2019s continued and frequent drug use and the \neffects it might have on his judgment, or his willful disdain and disregard for basic rules \nand regulations in furtherance of his own interests. Such conduct is directly at odds with \nthe government\u2019s compelling interest in trusting that those who have access to classified \ninformation will put the national interest ahead of their own. Applicant has made it \nabundantly clear that he is not interested in such an arrangement. Based on all of the \nforegoing, significant doubts about Applicant\u2019s judgment and suitability for clearance \npersist. Because protection of the national interest is the principal focus of these \nadjudications, those doubts must be resolved against the Applicant. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all available information, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security for Applicant to have access to classified information.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

The following disqualifying conditions are applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nand \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nApplicant acknowledges the alcohol consumption alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through \n1.c. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 23 are applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations.  \nAG \u00b6 23(a) is established. Applicant\u2019s history shows numerous alcohol-related \nincidents between 1996 and 2000. He served 18 years on active duty without another \nalcohol incident and since retirement in 2018 from the military there has not been an \nalcohol-related incident. Given the amount of time that has passed it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. \nAG \u00b6 23(b) is established. Applicant admits the incidents. He cites the time since \nthe incidents, his completion of the requisite classes, his lifestyle changes to bring his \ndrinking in line with societal norms, and his honorable military service until retirement from \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nthe military.

By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Block quote. \nThe following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable as detailed in AG \u00b6 \n31: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant\u2019s three alcohol-related convictions are cross-alleged under the criminal \nconduct guideline. He admitted the disorderly conduct and marijuana use events but \ndenied the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.a but acknowledges the charge. The above \ndisqualifying conditions apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable as detailed in AG \u00b6 \n32: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to, \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6 32(a) and (d) apply for the same reasons set forth under Guideline G. \nApplicant\u2019s actions prior to 2016 are mitigated by time. There is no record of prosecution \nof SOR 2.a. He was allowed to enlist, and he was subjected to a polygraph concerning \nthe incident. He held a security clearance for most of his career until his 2016 NJP. The \n2016 incident is isolated around several life events. After the NJP he continued to serve \nand retired honorably two years later. He has established a record of accomplishment of \nresponsible behavior and compliance with rules, regulations, and the law since the 2016 \nincident. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines G and J in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines G and J and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has met his burden to establish he has \nmitigated the security concerns raised by his alcohol consumption and criminal conduct. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

SOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleged the conduct in SOR \u00b6 1.a under \nGuideline J. \nApplicant does not have any other arrests or convictions. (Tr. 25, 27) No friends or \nfamily have expressed a concern to him about his alcohol consumption. (Tr. 29) He rarely \nconsumed alcohol because his employer required him to work in a country that does not \npermit alcohol use. (Tr. 30) When he consumed alcohol in July 2022, he had not had any \nalcohol to drink for six months. (Tr. 31) He claimed he drank one beer and two hard drinks \nin a bar. (Tr. 31, 36) His ticket for the DUI offense states he weighs 235 pounds; and he \nsaid at the hearing he weighed about 300 pounds in July 2022. (Tr. 32; AE B) \nApplicant left the bar about midnight, and he believed it was safe for him to drive. \n(Tr. 32) He said he did not feel any effects from his previous alcohol consumption at the \ntime he left the bar. (Tr. 33) His hotel was about 15 miles from the bar. (Tr. 33) After about \nfive minutes, he felt ill, and he pulled over onto the side of the road. (Tr. 34) Applicant\u2019s \nvehicle was at an off ramp where truckers park, and the vehicle may have been slightly \nover the line. (Tr. 40) He felt like he had been drugged or was suffering from food \npoisoning. (Tr. 34, 37) He felt it was unsafe to drive, and he fell asleep at about 1:00 a.m. \n(Tr. 34, 41) He did not remember if he turned off the ignition of his vehicle. (Tr. 39-40) At \nabout 3:00 or 4:00 a.m., the police woke him. (Tr. 34, 41) He had a breath-alcohol test \n(BAT) at the site of his arrest, and the officer said it showed he was over the legal limit; \nhowever, he said he did not remember the BAT result. (Tr. 42) He received another BAT \nat the police station, and the result was over the limit. He said he did not remember the \nresult of the second BAT.  \nApplicant told an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator that he did \nnot receive a blood-alcohol test, and he could not remember the alcohol content for his \nbreathalyzer tests. (GE 2) Two weeks after his arrest, he returned to the foreign country \nwhere he is employed. (Tr. 48) He returns to the United States about every six months to \nbe with his family. \nApplicant pleaded guilty to DUI. (Tr. 44) He received three years of informal \nprobation. (AE D) His probation permits him to drink alcohol. (Id.) He was sentenced to \npay fines and court costs of $1,545, and to attend a six-month alcohol program. (Id.) The \nsix-month alcohol program is required when a driver\u2019s blood-alcohol content (BAC) is \n\u201cbetween 0.15% and 0.19%.\u201d (HE 5) Applicant believes he can successfully complete the \nthree-year probation period, and the DUI conviction will be removed from his record. (Tr. \n25) He is not permitted to drive in the state where he was arrested for DUI for three years. \n(Tr. 46) He does not have a probation officer. (Tr. 46) He acknowledged that driving after \ndrinking alcohol was \u201cextremely stupid.\u201d (Tr. 49) \nApplicant provided court documents after his hearing which indicated his BAC was \n.16 percent. (AE C at 5) He acknowledged it was not possible for a person who weighs \n300 pounds to drink three drinks, stop drinking about 1:00 a.m., and provide a breath \nsample several hours later to test above the legal limit. (Tr. 54-55) He stood by his claim \nof only consuming three drinks.

And even then it was only wine/champagne \nto celebrate the season. Since the event that had happened to me it has \nbeen a real eye opener & rude awakening. I have since refrained & been \ntrying to get healthier & lose weight. Both for my career & for my children. \nBeing overweight & having sleep apnea is bad enough. You add alcohol \ninto the mix it only heightens the risk for medical issues. (AE G) \nApplicant\u2019s manager served with him in Europe when they were both on active \nduty and supervises him in his current overseas employment. He described Applicant as \nfollows: \nDuring the time I have known Applicant I could always count on him to get \nthe job done and done right. [He] gives 100% in everything he does and \nmakes security of the systems he works a priority. He is always willing to let \nour customer know what the requirements are and ensures we are in \ncompliance with all requirements. Please consider [him] for his security \nclearance. (AE E)  \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \u201cThe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of \nthe Guidelines and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.

By its very \nnature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 31(b), and 31(c) are established. Discussion of the disqualifying conditions \nis in the mitigating section infra. \nAG \u00b6 32 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b).   \nIn July 2022, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI.

He has an excellent employment \nrecord. \nApplicant appears to have minimized the amount of alcohol he consumed before \ndriving and being arrested. He said he only had three drinks before driving. He fell asleep \nin his vehicle which was parked on the side of the road. Several hours later he received \na BAT, and his BAC was .16 percent. \nApplicant\u2019s DUI offense shows poor judgment. None of the mitigating conditions \nare fully established because he is currently on probation, and he did not provide a \ncredible account of the amount of alcohol he consumed before his DUI arrest. Criminal \nconduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nAlcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 articulates the Government\u2019s concern about alcohol consumption, \n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or \nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 22 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case including: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nand  \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nAG \u00b6 22(a) and 22(c) are established. Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is \nin the mitigating section infra. \nAG \u00b6 23 details conditions that could mitigate security concerns including: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nIn July 2022, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. His BAC was .16 \npercent, which is of a sufficient magnitude to constitute binge-alcohol consumption. He \npleaded guilty, and in March 2023, he was sentenced to three years of probation. He \ncompleted all of the terms of his sentence including a six-month alcohol program, except \nfor his informal probation. \nApplicant is working for the defense contractor in a country where alcohol \nconsumption is not permitted. He only returns to the United States about every six months \nto visit his family. He rarely consumes alcohol. (AE E) AG \u00b6 23(b) applies. Alcohol \nconsumption security concerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines J and \nG are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 40-year-old supervisor and avionics technician, who has been \nemployed by a large defense contractor for seven years.

The case was \nassigned to me on January 11, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations in the SOR. His \nadmissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 29-year-old senior avionics integration and test engineer employed \nby a defense contractor since September 2022.

He was employed as an \nelectrical engineer by several federal contractors from October 2017 until he was hired \nby his current employer. \nIn October 2017, Applicant submitted an electronic questionnaire for non-sensitive \npositions (e-QIP) (SF 85 format). He answered \u201cNo\u201d to the question, \u201cIn the last year, \nhave you used, possessed, supplied, or manufactured illegal drugs?\u201d He did not disclose \nthat he had used lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and mushrooms on various occasions \nbetween approximately 2013 and the date of his e-QIP and that he had used marijuana \nfrom about August 2012 through the date of his e-QIP. \nIn September 2022, Applicant submitted another e-QIP (SF 86 format), seeking a \nsecurity clearance. In response to questions about illegal use of drugs or drug activity, he \ndisclosed that he regularly used marijuana in college about once a week between 2012 \nand September 2016 and that he used marijuana about one to three times a year between \n2016 and 2021. He disclosed that he used hallucinogenic substances such as LSD and \nmushrooms about two times a year while in college and about once a year until 2021. He \ndisclosed that he used Adderall as a study aid in college a few times a year. Finally, he \ndisclosed that he purchased marijuana illegally from 2012 to 2016 and that he purchased \nit from legal dispensaries from 2016 to 2021. \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he stated that his previous drug use was \ninfrequent, that he was not dependent on drugs, and that they had no negative effect on \nhis work or personal life. He decided to stop using illegal drugs in September 2021, when \nhe was offered a position that required a security clearance. He stated that he has not \nused Adderall for seven years. He stated that he did not disclose his drug involvement in \nhis October 2017 e-QIP because he was young, \u201crelatively fresh out of school,\u201d and afraid \nthat he would be fired if he disclosed it.

He acknowledged that his falsification was wrong and that he now understands \nthat he needs to be candid and forthright in matters involving national security. \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he pointed out that his last drug use was \nmore than two years ago and that it was his only drug involvement in the last four years. \nHe declared his intent to refrain from further illegal drug use and asked for consideration \nof his change of behavior and full disclosure of past drug use. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro.

Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); and \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nThe first prong of AG \u00b6 26(a) focuses on whether the drug involvement was recent. \nThere are no bright line rules for determining when conduct is recent. The determination \nmust be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence. If the evidence shows \na significant period of time has passed without any evidence of misconduct, then an \nadministrative judge must determine whether that period of time demonstrates changed \ncircumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of reform or rehabilitation. ISCR \nCase No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is not established. Although Applicant has abstained from illegal drug \nuse for a significant period of time, the evidence falls short of demonstrating rehabilitation. \nHe began reducing his illegal drug use in 2017, but he continued occasional use until \nabout two years ago. From the time of his false application in 2017 until September 2021, \nhe continued to use illegal drugs, knowing that it was contrary to federal law and \ninconsistent with his employer\u2019s policies. His drug use was not the result of unusual \ncircumstances. His motivation was his search for a new job, not a change of attitude about \ndrug involvement. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) is not fully established. Applicant has acknowledged his illegal drug \nuse and has abstained since September 2021. However, he provided no evidence that \nhe has disassociated from his drug-using associates or changed his environment. He has \nprovided a statement of intent to abstain from drug involvement and substance misuse, \nbut his statement does not include an express acknowledgment that any future \ninvolvement will be grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. His long period \nof working under false pretenses undermines the credibility of his current promise to \nabstain from illegal drug use. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges the Applicant\u2019s previous drug involvement alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c.

Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nThe following disqualifying conditions are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress \nby a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes . . . : engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nWhen Applicant submitted an e-QIP in 2017, he was not applying for a security \nclearance, but his questionnaire was used to determine his employment qualifications \nand trustworthiness. In his response to the SOR, he admitted that he knew he would be \nfired if he disclosed his drug involvement. His admissions establish AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and \n16(e). \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; and \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. Almost five years elapsed before Applicant disclosed \nhis falsification. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is not established. Applicant\u2019s falsification is not recent. It began in \nOctober 2017 and continued until September 2022. It did not happen under unique \ncircumstances. It was not minor. It undermined the integrity of his employer\u2019s \ndetermination that he was eligible for a sensitive position. It was a felony in violation of 18 \nU.S.C \u00a71001, punishable by a fine and imprisonment for up to five years.  \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because he requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline H and E and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his drug involvement \nand personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H (Drug Involvement): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Applicant submitted no response to the FORM. Applicant did not object to \nGovernment Items 1 through 12, and they are admitted into evidence, referenced \nhereinafter as Government Exhibits 1 through 12. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 52 years old. He is married and is a step-father. He has a high \nschool diploma. He is employed by a defense contractor as a General Laborer. He is \nseeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. He has no \nmilitary service. \nApplicant admits that he is a recovering alcoholic, and his alcoholism is common \nknowledge. He knows that he cannot safely consume any amount of alcohol.

He does not want to consume \nalcohol in the future, and he will continue to fight his battle with alcoholism. \n(Government Exhibit 3.) \nThe SOR highlights Applicant\u2019s extensive history of alcohol abuse and criminal \nconduct. From about August 1991 to at least July 2022, he has consumed alcohol at \ntimes to the point of intoxication, and on many occasions resulting in criminal violations. \nApplicant admits to each of the allegations set forth in the SOR. (Applicant\u2019s Answer to \nSOR.) \nApplicant started drinking alcohol at the young age of 10. He sporadically used \nalcohol from that time until he was 15. At the age of 15, he drank to the point of \nintoxication for the first time. From that time on, he consumed beer and liquor with his \nfriends mostly on the weekends. He would drink in social settings and obtain the \nalcohol from family or older friends. By the age of 20, he was arrested and charged the \nfirst time for Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol. Following this arrest, he had a \nperiod of sobriety for about 2 and a half years. Since that period of sobriety, he has had \noff and on period of sobriety followed by what he describes as \u201cbenders\u201d. He would \nabstain from alcohol use for six to nine months and then relapse. When he relapsed, he \nwould go on \u201cbenders\u201d where he would drink heavily, on a daily basis, for weeks. He \nwould consume twenty or more beers per day and be drunk all day, every day. He \nwould drink until his body could not handle anymore. (Government Exhibit 3.) \nApplicant\u2019s excessive alcohol abuse has resulted in a multitude of criminal \narrests, charges, and convictions. Applicant was arrested in about August 1991, and \ncharged with Driving While Intoxicated for the first time, Simple Assault, and Criminal \nmischief. In July 1999, he was arrested and charged a second time for Driving under \nthe Influence of Drugs/Liquor, excess alcohol concentration. In November 2002, he \nwas arrested and charged with Simple Assault, (Domestic Violence) while under the \ninfluence. In April 2003, Applicant was arrested and served a temporary order of \nprotection while under the influence of alcohol.

In May 2014, Applicant was arrested and \ncharged a fourth time with Reckless Operation of a vehicle, while under the Influence. \nIn 2015, Applicant was arrested and charged a fifth time with Driving Under the \ninfluence. In November 2017, Applicant was arrested and charged with Violation of a \nProtective Order While Under the Influence. (Government Exhibits 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and \n12.) \nApplicant has also been arrested and charged for criminal violations that were \nnot alcohol related. In September 2000, he was arrested and charged with False \nPersonation, of a police officer; and Operating Under Suspension, driving his vehicle \nafter his license had been suspended. In August 2001, he was arrested and charged \nwith Simple Assault, Resisting Arrest or Detention, and Obstructing Government \nAdministration. (Government Exhibits 10 and 11.) \nFollowing a month long \u201cbender\u201d, Applicant voluntarily entered an alcohol \ntreatment program from December 2021 through January 2022. There he received \ninpatient treatment for a condition diagnosed as Alcohol Use Disorder, Severe. During \nhis treatment, he was advised to completely stop consuming alcoholic beverages. \nAgainst the treatment advice and recommendation, Applicant resumed drinking alcohol \nsix months following his treatment. \nIn July 2021, Applicant relapsed and started \ndrinking again. In August 2022, he checked himself into treatment again. He again \nreceived treatment for his Alcohol Use Disorder, Severe condition. (Government Exhibit \n3.) \nDuring his subject interview, Applicant explained that he would usually go on \nbenders when he did not have a job lined up. He used to work in the steelworkers/ \nmasonry field and it was common for workers to have a drink of alcohol at lunch or drink \nheavily after work. It was considered part of the culture. Applicant stated that he \ngenerally drinks at home when he has no plans. (Government Exhibit 3.) \nApplicant stated that his drinking problem was known and DoD was aware of his \ncriminal record when he was issued a temporary or interim security clearance. He \nstates that he is a man of integrity and honesty. He does not lie, cheat, or steal. He \nloves his country and is a proud American and Step-Dad. (Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR.) \nApplicant submitted little evidence in mitigation, as he failed to respond to the FORM. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence that \nestablishes controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \n\u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, \nand has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance \ndecision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The disqualifying conditions raised by the evidence are: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder; \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nIn addition to other alcohol related arrests, Applicant was arrested, charged and \nconvicted on five separate occasions for DUI or Reckless Driving While Under the \nInfluence of Alcohol. These incidents raise security concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a), 22 (c), \n22(d), 22(e), and 22(f), set forth above. \nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security \nconcerns: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling \nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse, and \nis making satisfactory progress; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \nNone of the mitigating conditions are applicable here. Applicant is an alcoholic \nwho is in the midst of battling his addiction. He has a history of benders and numerous \nperiods of abstinence followed by numerous periods of relapse. He claims that his last \nuse of alcohol was in August 2022. If this is so, Applicant has been sober for about 14 \nmonths. He is commended for his efforts and encouraged to continue living a sober \nlifestyle. Given his 30 years of excessive alcohol consumption, however, more time in \nsobriety is needed in order to show the Government that he can be trusted and that he \nwill not return to his old ways. Applicant must continue to show that he can maintain \nsobriety and that future misconduct is unlikely to occur. At this time, Applicant has \nfailed to meet his burden to mitigate his alcohol consumption security concerns. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgement, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted or convicted. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 31 contains conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. None of the mitigating conditions are applicable. \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant\u2019s extensive criminal record listed above shows a pattern of poor \njudgment, unreliability, and untrustworthiness. \nHis numerous arrests, charges, and \nconvictions demonstrate a failure to comply with the law over many, many, years. In \ntotality, his misconduct calls into question his ability to follow rules, laws, and \nregulations. On the other hand, Applicant has recently acknowledged the seriousness \nof his alcohol condition, and has taken some steps to address his problem. \nHe \ncontends that he has been sober this time for 14 months. He is commended for this \neffort. However, given his criminal history, involving numerous alcohol-related arrests, \ncoupled with the extent of his alcoholism, more time is needed to show the Government \nthat he can remain alcohol free without difficulty. At this time, his past history shows \nthat he is not sufficiently reliable and trustworthy to access classified information. His \nmany violations of the law give rise to serious concerns about his judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness, both because of the nature of the offenses, and the circumstances \nsurrounding the offenses. The before-mentioned disqualifying conditions have been \nestablished and are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines G and J, in my whole-person analysis. Based upon the facts and analysis \nset forth above, Applicant has failed to provide sufficient evidence to demonstrate that \nhe meets the qualifications for a security clearance. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the Alcohol Consumption and Criminal Conduct \nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.n. \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a through 2.c. \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nDarlene Lokey Anderson \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and \nexhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 39 years old. He served in the military from 2002 until his honorable \ndischarge in 2012 in the paygrade E-5. He married in 2005 and divorced in 2014. He has \ntwo minor children from the marriage. He earned an associate degree in 2014 and a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2016. He has worked for his present employer, a federal contractor, \nsince February 2015. Prior to his present job, he worked for federal contractors from \nNovember 2014 to February 2015, and August 2013 to August 2014. He had periods of \nunemployment from his military discharge in May 2012 to August 2013 and August 2014 \nto November 2014. (Items 3, 4) \nWhile serving in the military, in about August 2011, Applicant went to a Uniform \nCode of Military Justice (UCMJ) Article 15 hearing, nonjudicial punishment (NJP), for two \nviolations of Article 92, failure to obey orders by committing sexual harassment and \nfraternization. The first charge states that in September 2010, Applicant made unwanted \nsexual advances toward X by repeatedly placing his hand on her thigh and then standing \nover her while she was seated in a chair and placing his hands on the armrest thereby \nnot allowing her to stand up. In addition, he was charged from August 2010 to February \n2011, with fraternizing by attempting to establish personal and romantic relationships with \nseveral subordinates in his section and his company. An investigation was conducted by \nthe Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) that included numerous statements from \nvictims and witnesses. They described firsthand that Applicant used his master key to \nenter their barracks rooms uninvited, made unwanted advances, unwanted touches by \nhitting a female military member on her buttocks and acting inappropriately. There is \nsubstantial evidence in the record supporting the charges. (SOR \u00b6 1.b) (Item 8) \nApplicant confirmed his rights under UCMJ Article 15, including the right to consult \nwith a military defense counsel and the right to refuse NJP and go to a court-martial.

He was found guilty \nof the offenses. He chose not to appeal. (Item 8) \nApplicant was interviewed by agents from the NCIS on February 22, 2011. He was \nafforded his UCMJ Article 31b rights. He denied he engaged in any inappropriate contact \nwith victims of the investigation. He denied he improperly used his master key at the \nbarracks. I have considered the numerous statements in the record from the victims and \nwitnesses and conclude there is substantial evidence that Applicant committed the UCMJ \noffenses and then was untruthful when he was interviewed by NCIS in February 2011.\n(SOR \u00b6 1.c) (Item 8)\n1\nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in February 2016 as part \nof the security investigation process. He denied he committed the NJP offenses. He \nprovided a narrative about an encounter at a barbeque, stating he placed his hands on \nhis accuser\u2019s shoulder, when in fact the offenses occurred when he entered a female \nmilitary member\u2019s barrack\u2019s room uninvited and repeatedly placed his hands on her thigh \ndespite requests to discontinue the behavior and then placed his hands on the armrest of \nher chair, not allowing her to get up. His statements to the government investigator \nobviously referred to a different encounter and not those that were adjudicated at his NJP \nand as detailed by the victims, witnesses, or the charges of which he was found guilty. \nHe claimed he did not act inappropriately. He claimed he was instructed by his leadership \nto accept the NJP and \u201cnot make waves.\u201d He disclosed his NJP on his September 2015 \nsecurity clearance application. He claimed innocence. In his response to the FORM, he \nagain claimed innocence. Based on the record evidence, I find he committed the offenses \nand was untruthful to the government investigator about the sexual harassment and \nfraternization offenses for which he went to NJP. (SOR 1.d) (Items 4, 8, 9) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s February 2016 interview he admitted he had a few small issues \nwhile in the military concerning disrespect, but he did not receive military discipline. The \ninvestigator confronted him with service record entries where he was counseled for \ndisrespect (UCMJ Article 91) to a senior noncommissioned officer. He admitted this \nincident occurred. He was not recommended for promotion in March 2006 due to lack of \njudgment, motivation, and maturity due to the incident. He was again not recommended \nfor promotion in May 2006. In May 2010, he was counseled for lack of judgment while on \nliberty because he was involved in disorderly conduct while evading military police. He \ndisagreed with the information when he was confronted with it by the investigator. He was \ncounseled in January 2011 for unauthorized overnight special liberty on December 20, \n2010.

He told the investigator that he received more accolades than disciplinary \nissues while in the military. (Item 9) \nIn June 2021, Applicant was arrested for felony possession of a controlled \nsubstance, cocaine. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) During another background interview in November \n2022, he explained his version of events to a government investigator. He stated that he \nwent to a Hookah lounge by himself. He met two women, and they invited him to go to \nanother Hookah lounge where he had never been. The two women were going to order \nan Uber, but Applicant offered to drive the three of them because he was not drinking \nalcohol. They went to the new Hookah lounge and his cell phone battery was low, so he \ndecided to leave it in the car to charge while they went into the lounge. He said the women \nleft their purses in the car and took out their wallets and phones. They paid the cover \ncharge to enter the lounge. After being in the lounge for a while he went outside to his car \nto retrieve his phone. When he did, he noticed a small baggie containing a white \nsubstance next to one of the purses. He told the investigator he \u201cfreaked out\u201d because he \nhas a job on base and cannot be around any drugs. He decided to get the drugs out of \nhis car. He took the bag and started to walk towards the entrance of the lounge and \nintended to throw the drugs away in a trashcan. He did not want to throw it on the ground \nor leave it in his vehicle. He was going to tell the women to retrieve their purses from his \nvehicle. (Item 10) \nThere was a police presence in the parking lot, so Applicant put the baggie in his \npocket. He was stopped by the police as he approached the door of the lounge. Applicant \ntold the investigator that he was told by the police he was trespassing and could not go \ninside the lounge. He was confused and told the police he had just been in the lounge \nand had paid the cover charge. He was told to put his hands behind his back, and he was \nsearched. The police found the baggie and tested it and determined it was cocaine. \nApplicant was arrested. He hired an attorney. His attorney told him to take a drug \neducation class. He took a one-week class and provided his certificate of completion to \nhis lawyer. He told the investigator that the charges were then dismissed. Applicant did \nnot inform his employer or his supervisor of his arrest or advise anyone in the military of \nhis arrest. He said he was told by his lawyer not to tell his employer, and he followed this \ninstruction. (Item10) \nThe police report provides a different version of the event. It reported that Applicant \nhad been told by the owner of the Hookah lounge to leave the establishment. Applicant \nreturned to the property and was advised multiple times to leave, and he refused to do \nso, which resulted in his arrest for criminal trespass. At that point, Applicant was searched, \nand a plastic baggie was found in his pants pocket. It was tested and determined to be \ncocaine. The police report does not state that Applicant denied the cocaine belonged to \nhim or that he identified that it belonged to the two women he had befriended. He was \nthen charged with possession of cocaine and was issued a written criminal trespass \nwarning. In October 2021, the District Attorney issued a No Charge Form, citing the \nreason as \u201cProsecutorial Discretion\u201d for the criminal trespass charge.

He denied the trespassing charge. He stated the charges were dropped. \nHe reiterated the same information that he provided to the investigator. (Items 2, 5) \nThe SOR alleged five delinquent debts totaling approximately $69,700. Applicant \ndid not disclose any delinquent debts on his March 2022 security clearance application \n(SCA). In November 2022 he told the investigator that he did not have the specific \ninformation or details on his financial accounts, so he did not list his debts or accounts. \nHe admitted to the investigator that he had delinquent debts. \nDuring his November 2022 interview, Applicant told the investigator that he would \ncontact all of his creditors and would attempt to establish payment plans. He would \nprovide documentations for all his payment arrangements if he could and provide receipts \nof accounts he settled or resolved. (Item 10) \nSOR \u00b6 2.a ($46,158) is a credit card debt. During his 2022 interview, Applicant \nsaid he had this credit card with his ex-wife. They both used the card. When they divorced, \nhe took responsibility for the debt. He could not keep up with the payments. The account \nis in collection and listed on his credit report as an individual account. In his answer to the \nSOR, he stated that his ex-wife had maxed out the credit card, and he was in the process \nof repairing his credit and making payment arrangements. Applicant did not provide any \ndocuments to show he has taken any action to resolve this debt. In his FORM response, \nhe did not provide any information about the status of this debt. It is not resolved. (Items \n2, 6, 7, 10) \nApplicant admitted the military credit card debt in SOR \u00b6 2.b ($10,993). He told the \ninvestigator that he tried to negotiate a payment plan, but the creditor wanted a lump-sum \npayment. He was not able to pay the amount. He stopped paying the debt when he was \nunemployed. He has been employed since 2015. His goal was to resolve this debt, and \nhe said he would contact the creditor again to establish a payment plan. Applicant\u2019s credit \nreport shows the last activity on this account was in September 2016. In his SOR answer, \nhe said he had a payment arrangement that he was making payments on for the past \nyear. He provided a document from November 2023 that showed scheduled payments \nwould begin in December 2023. He also provided a document showing he made the \npayments from February 2023 through November 2023. In his FORM response, he did \nnot provide proof of additional payments. It is likely he continued to make payments. This \ndebt is being resolved. (Items 2, 6, 7, 10) \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 2.c ($8,076) is a collection account for a delinquent loan. \nApplicant told the investigator that he could not recall when he acquired the loan and why. \nHe could not afford the payments, so he stopped paying it. He said he contacted the \ncreditor but could not reach a settlement agreement. In his answer to the SOR, he \nadmitted the debt and said he had talked to a representative who was willing to settle the \ndebt.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.

According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 31, and the following are \npotentially applicable: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nIn August 2011 Applicant went to an UCMJ Article 15 NJP for violations of Article \n92 for sexual harassment and fraternization. He was afforded his rights and was found \nguilty. He did not appeal. In June 2021, he was arrested for felony possession of cocaine \nand criminal trespass. The controlled substance was found on his person. The charges \nsubsequently were not prosecuted. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom criminal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant continues to deny that he did anything wrong for the offenses he went to \nNJP. He had an opportunity to refuse NJP and go to a court-martial and did not. He had \nan opportunity to appeal his conviction, he did not. There is substantial evidence he \ncommitted the offenses. Applicant had cocaine on his person when he was arrested. The \ncharge was later not prosecuted after he completed a drug education course. He denies \nany wrongdoing and has not taken responsibility for his conduct. Although there is a \nsignificant gap in time between his 2011 and 2021 criminal conduct, because Applicant \nrequested a determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to \nquestion him about his criminal conduct or evaluate his credibility and sincerity based on \ndemeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). Applicant did \nnot present sufficient mitigating evidence to conclude future criminal conduct is unlikely \nto recur. His conduct casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. The \nabove mitigating conditions do not apply. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility:  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other government representative;  \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual group. Such conduct includes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s personal, \nprofessional, or community standing.  \nApplicant\u2019s NJP conduct and arrest for cocaine possession were addressed under \nthe criminal conduct guideline (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a and 3.b) and cross-alleged under the personal \nconduct guideline (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b). Applicant went to NJP for sexual harassment \nand fraternization when he inappropriately touched a fellow service member and other \nmisconduct. He was arrested for cocaine possession in 2021. His conduct reflects \nquestionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. It also \ncreated vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable. \nAG \u00b6 16(c) is not perfectly applicable because Applicant\u2019s conduct is sufficient for an \nadverse determination under the criminal conduct guideline. However, the general \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconcerns about questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations contained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 and 16(c) are established. \nApplicant was interviewed by NCIS in February 2011 as part of their criminal \ninvestigation into sexual harassment and fraternization. Applicant denied any \ninappropriate contact with the victims. There is substantial evidence he committed the \noffenses. When interviewed by NCIS he deliberately provided a false statement. When \nhe was interviewed in February 2016 by a government investigator as part of his \nbackground investigation, he again deliberately provided a false statement. AG \u00b6 16(b) \napplies. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable to the \ndisqualifying security concerns based on the facts: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and  \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nApplicant did not provide evidence that he made a prompt, good-faith effort to \ncorrect his falsification. His sexual harassment, fraternization, and possession of cocaine \noffenses are not minor. The information was substantiated and from reliable sources. His \nfailure to be honest during a criminal investigation and security clearance investigation \nraises serious concerns. As stated above, because Applicant requested a determination \non the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to question him about his statement \nto investigators or evaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor. The security \nclearance process relies on those seeking a clearance to be honest and forthcoming. \nApplicant failed to do so, which casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. The above mitigating conditions do not apply. \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had delinquent debts totaling approximately$69,700. There is sufficient \nevidence to support the application of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe persons control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant provided evidence that he has paid or has a payment agreement for the \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 2.d and 2.e. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to these debts. \nApplicant admitted that the debt in SOR \u00b6 2.a ($46,145) was for a credit card that \nhe and his wife used while they were married, and he assumed responsibility for it when \nthey divorced. He later claimed it was his wife who spent excessively. He did not provide \nevidence of action he has taken to resolve this large debt. The debt in SOR \u00b6 2.c ($8,076) \nis for a loan he cannot recall the specifics about. He stated in 2022 that he got behind in \npayments when he was unemployed. He has been employed since 2015. Although, he \nstated he intended to pay it in the future, he did not provide evidence that he has resolved \nor is resolving the debt. His unemployment and divorce were beyond his control. Applicant \nhas not provided evidence that he acted responsibly once he resumed employment to \nresolve these debts. His debts remain ongoing. He did not provide evidence he has \nparticipated in financial counseling. There are not clear indications that his financial issues \nare under control. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b) and 20(c) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines J, E, and F in my whole-person analysis. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nThe record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised under Guideline J, criminal \nconduct, Guideline E, personal conduct, and Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph   2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph   2.b:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph   2.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.d-2.e: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n13 \n",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 13, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudication Services (DCSA CAS) issued Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines G, J, H, and E. The DCSA \nCAS acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on \nJune 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR with an undated response that included several \nattachments. He requested an administrative determination, but on July 25, 2023, \nDepartment Counsel exercised his right to request a hearing. (See hearing exhibit (HE) \nIII) The case was assigned to me on January 9, 2024. The Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on January 18, 2024, and the hearing \nwas held as scheduled on February 20, 2024. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1-\n4, which were admitted into evidence without objection. The Government\u2019s exhibit list \nand discovery letter were marked as HE I and II. Applicant testified, but he did not offer \nany exhibits at his hearing. I kept the record open after the hearing and he timely \nsubmitted exhibits (AE) A-C, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the \nhearing transcript (Tr.) on March 1, 2024. \nProcedural and Evidentiary Issues \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to add a \nGuideline J allegation. The amended allegation was stated as follows: \n4.a. In about March 2021, you were arrested and charged with \nvehicular Assault-DUI, in County A, State A. You plead guilty, and were \nsentenced to fines and fees, of $11,355, 1.5 years confinement, 15 years\u2019 \nprobation, and 596 hours of community service. You are still on probation \nand will remain so until the year 2036. \nApplicant did not object to the amendment and did not request additional time to \naddress the new allegation (although, it is in essence a cross-allegation of SOR \u00b6 1.a). I \ngranted the motion and the SOR was so amended. (Tr. 12-14) \nRegarding the evidentiary issue, during Department Counsel\u2019s cross examination \nof the Applicant, he asserted factual information that was neither alleged nor admitted \nas substantive evidence. Department Counsel specifically stated as a preface to a \nquestion that the injured party died as a result of the accident. I presume he had a \ngood-faith basis for the question, but he did not offer substantive evidence establishing \nthat fact. He offered to do so, but he did not. I will only use this information as a basis \nfor impeaching Applicant\u2019s testimony, and for no other purpose. The relevant rules for \nimpeachment are laid out in the Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) 607-609, which I used \nas a guide. (Tr. 53-54) \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer, he admitted all the allegations under Guidelines J, G, and \nH in the SOR with some explanation.

(Tr. 6, 26-27, 45; GE 1) \nApplicant moved from another state to State A in order to take his current job. \nJust as he began working, the pandemic occurred, and he was required to work \nremotely starting in March 2020. Because he was in a new state and essentially \nsequestered from everyone else, he was unable to make new friends or engage in \nsocial contacts. He experienced depression (his description, not a diagnosed condition). \nThis led to a gradual increase in his alcohol consumption. By January 2021, he was \ndrinking excessively. He drank alone. Looking back on it, he sees that he had a drinking \nproblem. He knew he needed to stop drinking, but he was unmotivated to do so. He did \nnot let it affect his work. This excessive alcohol consumption led to the events described \nbelow concerning Guideline G, J, and SOR \u00b6 3.a of Guideline E. (Tr. 27-29) \nAlcohol Consumption and Criminal Conduct \nUnder Guideline G, the SOR alleged Applicant was charged in March 2021, with \nVehicular Assault-DUI, for which he pleaded guilty and was sentenced to fines of over \n$11,000; one and a half years\u2019 confinement, 15 years\u2019 probation; and 596 hours of \ncommunity service. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) It also alleged that in March 2021 he was charged with \nDUI, pleaded guilty, and was sentenced to one year confinement (this charge derives \nfrom the same underlying factual incident alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a). (SOR \u00b6 1.b) The SOR \nalso alleged two administrative consequences from Applicant\u2019s pleas to the charges \nlisted above. Those include that he was court-ordered to participate in DUI-education \ncourses and out-patient therapy, which he attended from March 2021 to December \n2021. (SOR \u00b6 1.c) He was also ordered to install an interlock device in his vehicle for \ntwo years. (SOR \u00b6 1.d) \nUnder Guideline J, the SOR cross-alleged the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a and added \nlanguage stating that Applicant was currently on probation and would remain so until \n2036. (SOR \u00b6 4.a) \nAs stated above, in March 2021, Applicant was still working from home. On \nMarch 2, 2021, after his work day, he began drinking whiskey at home. He later walked \nto a neighborhood bar and had more drinks with his dinner. He returned home after \ndinner and had more drinks. His roommate told him about a great ski sale that was \ngoing on. Since Applicant was an avid skier, he decided to drive to the ski store to buy \nsome skis. He bought the skis, then stopped for some fast food. He then was driving \nhome when he caused an accident with another car that resulted in an injury. He \ntestified that he rearended a vehicle. The injured party stated in a magazine interview \nthat Applicant was traveling 85 miles an hour when his car slammed into the injured \nparty\u2019s car.

On June 30, 2021, \nhe pleaded guilty to both counts. On September 17, 2021, he was sentenced as follows: \nfor Count 1, jailtime of 1.5 years, 15 years\u2019 probation; for Count 2, 1-year jailtime, \nserved concurrently with Count 1 (the court authorized work release for Applicant, and \nauthorized his participation in Alcoholic Anonymous (AA) and counseling services while \nincarcerated). He was also ordered to pay costs and fees of approximately $11,000. \nThe court ordered that he could only drive using an interlock device installed for two \nyears. The court ordered that he perform 596 hours of community service. (Tr. 31, 33-\n34; GE 2 (attachment 2-sentencing mittimus)) \nApplicant has completed the incarceration portion of his sentence.

He was placed into a work-release program where he \nwas allowed to work at his job during the duty day and returned to a barracks-like facility \nafter work. He would rideshare to and from work. He followed all the rules of the work-\nrelease program. (Tr. 34-35) \nApplicant provided a receipt showing that he paid his court-ordered $11,000 fines \nand fees in December 2021.

He began attending AA daily in March 2021. He continues to attend AA at \nleast weekly without a court order to do so. He has made friendships through AA. He is \ncommitted to sobriety for the rest of his life. A member of his AA group, Ms. CD, who is \nalso a licensed addictions counselor, wrote a letter supporting Applicant.

She also opines, based upon her personal and \nprofessional experience, that Applicant is genuinely interested in changing his life. \nApplicant intends to remain sober the rest of his life with the help of his new healthy \nnetwork of friends.

They both were fully aware of the \nDUI-injury accident that he caused. They both found him remorseful over his actions \nand have observed his willingness to seek alcohol education. He volunteers for civic \nprojects and clean-ups. They both asked the criminal judge to exercise leniency toward \nApplicant. (SOR Answer (attachments)) \nA family friend, who is an attorney, wrote that he talked to Applicant about the \naccident and believed that he was ashamed of his actions and remorseful for what he \nhad done. In that vein, he cooperated with the injured party to insure that he received \nthe full benefit of Applicant\u2019s insurance policy. He has seen Applicant\u2019s commitment to \nAA and witnessed the closeness he has with his AA sponsor. (SOR Answer \n(attachment)) \nApplicant\u2019s aunt, who is a retired special agent in federal law enforcement, also \nwrote on his behalf.

(SOR \nAnswer (attachment)) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.

According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed with alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant\u2019s arrest on March 2, 2021, for Vehicular Assault-DUI, resulting from his \ndriving with a blood-alcohol level of .21 percent and causing an injury-accident \nestablishes this disqualifying condition concerning SOR \u00b6 1.a. The allegation stated in \nSOR \u00b6 1.b, is based upon the same underlying facts as SOR \u00b6 1.a and is therefore \nduplicative and found for Applicant. The allegations stated in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d are \nelements of Applicant\u2019s sentence based upon the same underlying facts and do not \nestablish independent disqualifying conditions. I find for Applicant regarding SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c \nand 1.d on that basis. \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for alcohol consumption \nunder AG \u00b6 23 and found the following relevant: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; and  \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s injury-causing DUI offense was very serious, it was his only \noffense before or since the incident. He has complied with all the court ordered \nrequirements such as completing his one-year work-release incarceration, paying his \nfines, nearly completing his 596 hours of community service, installing an interlock \ndevice on his car, and complying with all his other probation requirements. He \nparticipated in alcohol education and therapy and remains sober three years after the \naccident. He is fully immersed in the AA program as corroborated by several persons \nwho made statements for him. His treatment therapist believes he is motivated to \nexamine himself and change his destructive drinking patterns. He is committed to a \nsober lifestyle and has acted in furtherance of that lifestyle. Both AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and 23(d) \nsubstantially apply. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for criminal conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted; and   \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation. \nApplicant\u2019s March 2021 Vehicular Assault-DUI and DUI charges and convictions \nsupport the application of AG \u00b6 31(b). The evidence also established that Applicant is \ncurrently on probation. AG \u00b6 31(c) also applies. \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for criminal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 32 and considered the following relevant: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nFor the same reasons stated above under Guideline G, AG \u00b6 32(a) substantially \napplies here. Even though Applicant could be on probation until the year 2036, he has \nestablished a documented track record of compliance with his probation requirements. \nWhile he remains on probation, I am convinced he will remain compliant with those \nrequirements in the future. AG \u00b6 32(d) also substantially applies here. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. One potentially applicable in this case includes: \n(a) any substance misuse. \nApplicant used marijuana, Adderall without a prescription, cocaine, and illegal \nmushrooms during the dates alleged. AG \u00b6 25(a) applies. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. One \npotentially applies in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \nApplicant credibly testified that all his illegal drug use ceased by 2019. His \nmarijuana use, which was the most frequently used drug, ceased while he was still in \ncollege. His remaining drug use ceased after college in 2017. He is committed to a \nsober lifestyle and does not intend to use illegal drugs in the future. His active AA \nparticipation favors his current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6 26(a) \napplies. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nApplicant\u2019s drunk driving incident that resulted in a serious injury to the victim and \nhis drug use while in college and shortly thereafter, reflects questionable judgment and \nan unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. AG \u00b6 16(c) is applicable. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nis potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \nThe analyses under Guidelines G, J, and H apply equally here. Personal conduct \nsecurity concerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant provided sufficient \nevidence to mitigate the alleged security concerns. \n[Since he remains on probation for some time (which is disqualifying under \nGuideline J), you might bolster the WPC analysis by again noting your positive \nassessment of his demeanor and credibility as well as his proven track record of \ncompliance with probation requirements thus far, as well as other WPC character \nevidence]. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns under all Guidelines, or those \nconcerns were not established. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.d:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a - 3.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline J:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 4.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

His admissions are incorporated into my \nfindings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence \nsubmitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 39 years old. He is married and has three young children. He \nexperienced a challenging childhood where his parents were abusive and drug use was \n\u201cpervasive\u201d in his home. (Tr. 81) He described that his parents were often \u201con the move \nor on the run\u201d and that, beginning in middle school, he was primarily self-educated. \n(Tr. 25) However, he graduated high school as a national merit scholar. He completed a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2006 and a master\u2019s degree in 2009. (GX 1-3; AX C-D; Tr. 20-29) \nAfter completing his master\u2019s degree, Applicant continued with his university as a \nresearch assistant and started his doctoral studies. In 2011, he started a company with a \nfocus on small unmanned aircraft systems design and manufacturing. In 2012, he \nterminated his academic work to focus on the growing business. (GX 1-3; AX C-D; \nTr. 28-35) \nAs part of obtaining a Government contract, Applicant signed a non-disclosure \nagreement and submitted a security clearance application (SCA) in February 2013. In the \nSCA, he disclosed that he had sporadically used marijuana and cocaine from about 2003 \nthrough 2012. Specifically, he used marijuana on about five to ten occasions in college \nand with his uncle on a hunting trip. He described his uncle as a very close, father-like \nfigure. Applicant also described obtaining and using cocaine once with his wife and once \nduring a new year\u2019s party. (GX 1-3; 5; AX E; Tr. 50-62) \nIn April 2014, Applicant was granted a security clearance and his company \ncontinued to grow in the years that followed. At its height, he estimated that the company \nhad about 50 employees. As the CEO, he was responsible for developing the business \nand obtaining new capital. During this time, he traveled extensively and worked long \nhours, primarily serving commercial clients. With regard to the company\u2019s classified \ncontract, he was the only one in his company that held a security clearance, and he did \nnot directly work with classified information. Instead, most of the work for the Government \ninvolved manufacturing unclassified parts that went into classified systems. However, he \ntestified that his holding of a security clearance was necessary to maintain the \nGovernment contract and that he occasionally received classified threat-assessment \nbriefings.

His contract switched to his current employer in October 2022, and \nhe became a chief systems engineer. In February 2024, he transitioned to a position as \na subject matter expert and now primarily works alongside a civilian workforce for the \nUnited States military. (GX 1, 3, 5; AX D; Tr. 23-39; 108-110) \nAs part of his new employment obligations, he submitted another SCA in May \n2022. In this application, he disclosed additional cocaine and marijuana use. Specifically, \nhe used cocaine on three occasions from 2015 through 2018. His first use occurred with \nfriends during a new year\u2019s party in 2015. He used cocaine again one time in 2016 during \na golf outing with potential investors. He described this use occurring in an attempt to fit \nin with the investment banking culture. In 2017, he last used cocaine with fraternity \nbrothers during a college reunion event. He also used marijuana on two additional \noccasions. The first use occurred during a hunting trip in 2017 and the second use \noccurred around Thanksgiving in 2019. In both instances, he used marijuana with his \nuncle. (GX 1, 3-4; AX E; Tr. 43-54, 64-72) \nFollowing his May 2022 SCA disclosure, Applicant submitted a detailed summary \nof his drug use to his facility security officer and provided candid details of his use during \nhis July 2022 background interview with a DOD investigator. He acknowledged that he \ndid not report his drug use at the time it occurred, but claimed he was not aware of the \nreporting requirement at the time. (GX 1, 3-4; AX E; Tr. 47-54) \nDuring his testimony, Applicant stated that he clearly made poor choices regarding \nhis past drug use but had experienced changed circumstances since his last use in 2019. \nHe described his own maturation as a father and in his career. He no longer associates \nwith any friends or fraternity brothers who use drugs. He described maintaining \u201cno \npropensity or desire\u201d to use drugs and signed a statement to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement while acknowledging that any future involvement may result in the revocation \nof his clearance. (Tr. 51) He still maintains contact with his uncle. However, after being \ninterviewed by DOD investigators, his uncle is aware to not use marijuana with Applicant \nin the future. (GX 1, 3; AX E; Tr. 50-52, 77-85) \nMr. S and Mr. T testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf. Mr. S is a former Army Ranger who \nis currently a federal civilian employee and holds a security clearance. He has known \nApplicant for the last three years, has daily interactions with him and described him as \n\u201cthe best systems engineer [he] has ever come across.\u201d (Tr. 97) He was aware of \nApplicant\u2019s past drug use. Since he has known Applicant, he found Applicant exercised \ngood judgment, was trustworthy, and \u201chonest to a fault.\u201d (Tr. 98) Mr. S stated his belief \nthat Applicant\u2019s history of drug use was behind him, and that Applicant could be trusted \nwith matters of national security. (Tr. 93-101) \nMr. T also holds a security clearance, has known Applicant for over three years, \nand is his direct supervisor.

Mr. T described Applicant as a leader in the program and \nconsidered him to be reliable and trustworthy. (Tr. 108-114) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d 484 \nU.S. 518, 531 (1988) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse: \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nConditions that could raise drug involvement and substance misuse concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence reflect that he sporadically used cocaine \nfrom 2003 through 2017 and marijuana from 2003 through 2019. His use of cocaine and \nmarijuana continued after he was granted access to classified information in 2014 and \nmaintained a sensitive position. All of the above disqualifying conditions are established. \nConditions that could mitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 26. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant used marijuana and cocaine sporadically over an extended period of \ntime. Additionally, his ongoing use of drugs while holding a security clearance was a \nserious transgression. However, Applicant voluntarily disclosed all of his past illegal drug \nuse in his SCAs and background interview and established changed circumstances over \nan extended period of time. His testimony was candid and forthcoming. He recognized \nhis errors in judgment and described his maturation as a father and in his career. He is \ncommitted to leading a drug-free life and no longer associates with friends who use drugs. \nAlthough he still maintains contact with his uncle, his uncle is aware to not involve him in \nany future marijuana use. \nApplicant also signed a statement to abstain from all drug involvement \nacknowledging that any future drug involvement may result in the revocation of his \nclearance. The evidence supports that Applicant has been leading an exemplary life and \nmaintains a strong commitment to his work as well as an understanding of the importance \nof protecting national security. I do not believe he will use illegal drugs in the future. I have \nconsidered all of the evidence and find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) apply. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for personal conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \nConditions that could raise personal conduct concerns are provided under \nAG \u00b6 16. The following are potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity. \nSOR \u00b6 2.b is a cross-allegation of all of the drug involvement and substance \nmisuse allegations. Applicant\u2019s history of cocaine and marijuana use is discussed under \nGuideline H above. SOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant continues to associate with friends \nand relatives involved in drug use. Applicant previously associated with friends who used \ndrugs and he maintains a strong familial bond with his uncle who continues to use \nmarijuana. This raises sufficient whole-person concerns for AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and 16(g) to be \napplicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the personal conduct concerns are provided under \nAG \u00b6 17. The following are potentially applicable: \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations. \nApplicant credibly testified that he no longer associates with fraternity brothers or \nfriends who use drugs. Additionally, his uncle is aware that Applicant must abstain from \nany future drug use and their ongoing relationship does not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. Applicant\u2019s circumstances have significantly \nchanged since he last used drugs and he detailed the steps he has taken to no longer \nparticipate in any drug use. Applicant\u2019s candor about his past drug use and commitment \nto remaining drug free reduce his vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. In \nconsideration of all of the evidence presented, I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(e) and 17(g) are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H and Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant is a dedicated professional who is a devoted family man and father. He \nrecognizes his past use of illegal drugs was inconsistent with being a role model and was \ninconsistent with his employment while holding a security clearance. His use of drugs \nwhile holding a security clearance was a serious transgression. However, he has \nabstained from using illegal drugs for more than five years and has demonstrated \nsignificant changed circumstances. Based on his candid disclosures in his SCAs, \nbackground interview, and testimony, I believe illegal drug use is entirely in his past. The \nrecord evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant's eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated \nthe security concerns arising under Guideline H, and Guideline E. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is clearly consistent with the national interest \nto grant Applicant a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \nBryan J. Olmos \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

He claimed he was \ntold by his accountant that they would be filing his back tax returns and assumed they \nwere filed.

(GE 4: Tr. 28) \nApplicant\u2019s mistaken reliance on a prior accountant to file his federal and state \ntax returns for tax years 2017-2018, was never documented.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \n3 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n                                                    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. . . . AG \u00b6 18. \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7.

See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd.

DC \u00b6 19(f), \u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, \nstate, or local income tax returns, or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax as required,\u201d applies to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nApplicant\u2019s documented tax-filing lapses, albeit accompanied by explanations of \nthe circumstances surrounding his failures to timely filed his federal and State A tax\nreturns for the years in issue require no independent proof to substantiate them. See\nDirective 5220.6 at E3.1.1.14; McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 262 (6th  ed. 2006). His\nadmitted tax-filing failures are fully documented and create judgment issues as well over\nthe management of his finances. See ISCR Case No. 03-01059 (App. Bd. Sept. 24,\n2004). Financial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required\nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that\nentitles the person to access classified information.

See ISCR \nCase No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. \nBd. Aug. 18, 2015); ISCR Case No. 14-00221 at 2-5 (App. Bd.

In the past, the \nAppeal Board has consistently imposed evidentiary burdens on applicants to provide \ndocumentation corroborating actions taken to resolve financial problems, whether the \nissues relate to tax-filing lapses, back taxes owed, or other debts and accounts. See \nISCR Case No. 19-02593 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, 2021); ISCR Case No. 19-01599 at \n3 (App. Bd.

While \nApplicant is entitled to credit for his military service, his service contributions are not \nenough at this time to overcome his repeated failures or inability to address his tax-filing \nand payment responsibilities in a timely way over the course of many years. Overall \ntrustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment have not been established. \nBased on a consideration of all of the facts and circumstances covered in this \ncase, it is too soon to make safe predictions that Applicant will be able to undertake \nmeritorious, good-faith efforts to mitigate the Government\u2019s financial concerns within the \nforeseeable future. More time is needed for him to establish the requisite levels of \nstability with his finances to establish his overall eligibility for holding a security \nclearance. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person.

He denied the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.c. His admissions are adopted \nas findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 50-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began working \nat his present job in approximately June 2022. He works as a software engineer. He has \na bachelor\u2019s degree, as well as a law degree. He married in 1997 and has a 12-year \nchild. His wife is a structural engineer and runs her own business. (Tr. 6, 17, 23-24; GE \n1-2) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant was delinquent on three accounts (a bank debt, a \nvendor debt, and rent from a lease agreement) totaling approximately $21,600 \n(excluding the amount of the rent debt, which was unspecified). The debts are \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s admissions in his interrogatory responses from March 2023, \nhis SOR admissions; and his hearing testimony. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\u20131.c) (Tr. 27-29, 32-37; \nGE 2; SOR answer) \nApplicant admitted all the SOR debts during his testimony. He also admitted that \nhe has not made any voluntary payments toward any of the debts as of the date of the \nhearing. He stated that the reason for his financial difficulties was because he quit his \nposition as a patent attorney, where he was dissatisfied with his work, and started a \nbusiness in late 2019 that ultimately failed. He closed the business in approximately \nMay to June 2022. These debts resulted from the business. (Tr. 22, 28-33; SOR \nanswer) \nWhile none of the debts appear on Applicant\u2019s credit report because they were \nbusiness debts, he admitted signing a personal guarantee for each of the debts. He \nbelieved the business failed because he started it up right as the pandemic took hold in \nthis country, which delayed his start date and his ability to get needed supplies. Besides \nthe SOR debts, Applicant also used his personal finances to continue operating the \nbusiness. He estimated that he suffered a total financial loss of approximately $550,000 \nto keep the business operating. He decided he could not keep investing money into the \nbusiness, so he closed it in 2022 and then was able to secure his position with his \ncurrent employer as a software engineer. (Tr. 20-23, 28, 38) \nApplicant admitted seeking advice from a bankruptcy attorney about the \nadvisability of filing for bankruptcy protection because of these business debts.

He chose to follow this advice. So far, the \ncreditors have not sought enforcement of his personal guarantees for the business \ndebts. He admitted that he currently does not have the funds to pay the debts. (Tr. 26-\n28) \nThe status of the three SOR debts is as follows: \nSOR 1.a-bank debt-$17,000. Applicant admitted this debt. The debt was \noriginally approximately $30,000, but when he was hired for his current position his \nsigning bonus of approximately $13,000 was deposited into his bank account and his \nbank diverted those funds toward his unpaid loan account. Other than that involuntary \npayment, he has not made any further payments on this account. (Tr. 30-32; SOR \nAnswer) \nSOR 1.b-vendor debt-$4,600. Applicant admitted this debt was for unpaid \nsupplies and materials from one of the vendors with whom he did business. He has not \nmade any payments toward this debt since closing his business. (Tr. 33; SOR answer) \nSOR 1.c-unexpired lease debt-unspecified amount. Applicant explained that \nthis debt resulted from the agreement he signed with his landlord to rent the space for \nhis business location. In February 2020, he signed a ten-year lease with a monthly rent \nof $4,000. He made those payments through late 2021 or early 2022. In May 2022, he \nand his landlord agreed to a lease termination. The landlord has not sought other legal \nrecourse against Applicant. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 29, 33, 36; SOR answer-\nattachment to answer) \nApplicant\u2019s current finances shows that he has approximately $860 as a monthly \nresidual after paying his current expenses and servicing his non-SOR debts, which \ninclude two mortgages (balances of $347,657 and $51,2370); student loans (balance of \n$17,522); two auto loans (balances of $14,175 and $10,182); and three credit cards \n(balances of $22,665; $47,327; and $3,162). He listed his assets, including his home, \nvalued at $854,000; his wife\u2019s retirement accounts, valued at $600,000; his wife\u2019s \nbusiness, valued at $200,000; and savings of $2,000. He had not approached his wife \nabout using her retirement funds to pay the business debts. He presented no evidence \nof financial counseling, other than his discussion with his bankruptcy attorney. (Tr. 39-\n41; GE 2, pp. 12-13 (Personal Financial Statement)) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.

The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant accumulated three delinquent debts, two of which remain unpaid or \nunresolved. He made a conscious decision not to file for bankruptcy and wait to see if \nthe creditors would forgive his debts. I find all of the above disqualifying conditions are \nraised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent and he admitted that, aside from resolving the lease \ndebt, he has not voluntarily paid or attempted to resolve them. He made a conscious \nchoice not to address his delinquent debts, rather he decided to see if the creditors \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \nwould forgive them and he could avoid bankruptcy. While this decision may be a sound \nfinancial decision, it does nothing to show his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment for security worthiness purposes. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable. \nApplicant\u2019s decision to change career paths and start a new business just before \nthe effects of the 2020 pandemic was partially a condition beyond his control. However, \nby failing to address his SOR debts after closing the business he has not acted \nresponsibly. He admittedly weighed the benefit of pursuing bankruptcy but decided \nagainst this action. His bank involuntarily captured his signing bonus of $13,000 and \napplied it to his debt with the bank. He also negotiated a termination agreement with his \nlandlord. Other than these actions, he pursued no other payment options with the \ncreditors. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully applicable. \nAside from his contact with a bankruptcy attorney, Applicant did not present \nevidence of financial counseling. He failed to establish good-faith efforts to resolve his \ndebts. The involuntary capture of funds by his bank applied to his business loan does \nnot meet the test of good faith. Given the unpaid status of his debts and the lack of a \nresponsible plan to resolve them, Applicant\u2019s financial problems are not under control. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and AG 20(d) do not apply, except as to SOR \u00b6 1.c. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nI considered the circumstances surrounding his indebtedness. However, I also \nconsidered that he has made insufficient efforts to resolve his debts. He has not \nestablished a meaningful track record of financial responsibility. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On March 27, \n2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) provided for \nthe above relief measures through September 30, 2020. See Federal Student Aid (FSA) \nwebsite, ISCR Case No. 20-02787 at 3 n.1 (App. Bd. Mar. 2022) This student loan debt \nrelief was extended several times by subsequent Executive Orders. See \nhttps://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/covid-19. Congress recently barred any \nfurther extensions and DoEd announced that student loan repayments would resume in \nOctober 2023.

He offered no evidence of any action this debt. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis  \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson's self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are established by the evidence: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant's federal student loans were assigned for collection starting in 2008. A \nsecurity clearance represents an obligation to the Federal Government for the protection \nof national secrets. Accordingly, failure to honor other obligations to the Government has \na direct bearing on an applicant's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. See ISCR Case No. 14-03358 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2015). While \nApplicant\u2019s student loans may no longer be considered delinquent since March 2020 \nbecause of the COVID-19 deferment, that action does not excuse previously delinquent \nstudent loans such as these. See ISCR Case No. 20-01527 at 2 (App. Bd. June 7, 2021). \nIn addition, there\u2019s no evidence that he made payments toward his student loans once \nthe payment pause was lifted in October 2023. The above listed conditions are made \napplicable to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.h, as well as to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i-1.j, thereby shifting the burden to \nApplicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant admitted during his background interview he failed to settle the alleged \ndebts and he provided no evidence of any action on these debts. Even if he has availed \nhimself of any of the COVID relief options, it is his pre-Covid relief student loan \ndelinquencies that led to collection and the insufficiency of the evidence that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances that are determinative. He also provided no \nevidence to support his resolution of the two consumer debts. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not \nestablished. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant offered no evidence of any difficulty in \nworking with his creditors. His actions and statements regarding his handling of the debts \nalleged prior to any COVID relief options show that he has not acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. The Appeal Board in ISCR Case No. 20-01527 at 2 (App. Bd. June 7, \n2021) addressed this factual situation, noting that \u201cthe Judge addressed this issue by \nconcluding that, while the President\u2019s action effectively places Applicant\u2019s student loans \nin a deferment status, it does not excuse Applicant\u2019s past inactions in the context of \nsecurity clearance eligibility.\u201d (Decision at 9) The credit report in the record reflects that \nApplicant\u2019s student loan delinquencies date back prior to any COVID relief options. (Item \n5.) He provided no evidence to support his resolution of the two consumer debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant provided no documentary evidence to \nsupport his statements that he had saved as much funds as possible to execute his stated \nplan to resolve his existing debts by utilizing a lump sum payment method. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant's eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant's conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): (1) the nature, extent, \nand seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                     \n \n \n \n   \n                     \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclearance.

(Item 3 at 56-62) \nDuring her February 2023 interview with an investigator with the U.S. Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM), Applicant discussed her financial issues. She claimed they arose \nduring her first marriage when she was the sole wage earner for the family, and the \ncombination of low wages and high medical co-pays led to financial difficulties in about \n2015. She noted that in her SF 86, she only reported the accounts that had not yet been \nresolved. She considers accounts that have been charged off by the original creditor as \nhaving been resolved. In about 2017, she wanted to repair her credit to qualify for a \nresidence that she and her current spouse eventually intended to purchase. It is unclear \nif she took any corrective steps at that time. (Item 7 at 3) \nDuring that OPM interview, Applicant acknowledged that she had not contacted \nany creditors. She conceded that she was currently earning enough income to pay off her \ncharged-off debts but has \u201chesitated in doing so because she is in a good spot in her life \nand doesn\u2019t want to reopen that door. [She] does not want the mental stress of contacting \ncreditors and making payment arrangements for old debt. [She] considered the charged \noff debts a closed issue and was not concerned with contacting the creditors.\u201d (Item 7 at \n3) Nevertheless, she later indicated that she would contact the credit reporting agencies \nand dispute the charged-off accounts. Although she knows the accounts are hers, she \nintended to dispute them to ensure the requested amounts are correct. If the accounts \nare verified as correct, she stated that she would contact the creditor and attempt to make \npayment arrangements without specifying when and if such actions might occur. (Item 7 \nat 3) However, as of the date the SOR was issued \u2013 nearly three months later \u2013 Applicant \nhad made no payments to any of her creditors on her delinquent accounts. \nWith respect to Applicant\u2019s position that charged-off debts are resolved that \nunderstanding is incorrect. A \u201ccharged-off debt\u201d is an accounting entry. A creditor \nconsiders a debt owed to the creditor to be an asset. When the value of the asset is in \ndoubt, the creditor is required to change the status of the debt to reflect its current status. \nWhen the debt appears to be uncollectible, the creditor should change the status for \naccounting purposes from being an asset to charged-off status. Notwithstanding the \nchange to charged-off status, a creditor may still sell the debt to a collection agent, and \nin some instances the debtor may still pay or settle the debt. Eventually, the charged-off \ndebts will be dropped from the debtor\u2019s credit report. \u201c[T]hat some debts have dropped \noff his [or her] credit report is not meaningful evidence of debt resolution.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n14-05803 at 3 (App. Bd.

He routinely receives unsolicited positive feedback on her values and capability \nfrom various professionals with the parent organization. (Letter, dated December 15, \n2023, attached to Response to the FORM) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1))  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive and has the burden of establishing \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation, or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe SOR alleged three still-delinquent charged-off accounts totaling approximately \n$22,588. Applicant\u2019s finances may have initially been negatively impacted by her \nunemployment during the period from September 2014 until May 2015, but she attributed \nmost of her financial difficulties to being a sole wage earner for the family and the \ncombination of low wages and high medical co-pays for her first spouse\u2019s medical issues \nin about 2015. She has held her current employment position since August 2015. She \nwas divorced in 2017. The three accounts, including the repossessed automobile, alleged \nin the SOR have been delinquent since 2015 or 2016. Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent \ndebts appears to present both an inability to satisfy debts and a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) have been established. \nIt is noted that the issues associated with Applicant\u2019s delinquent accounts were \nfirst reported by Applicant in her SF 86 in October 2022, and discussed in detail in \nFebruary 2023 when she was interviewed by OPM. Until the interview, approximately six \nor seven years after the debts became delinquent, Applicant made no efforts to resolve \nany of them despite acknowledging that the debts were hers. She explained her decision \nby claiming that she was currently earning enough income to pay off her charged-off debts \nbut has hesitated to do so because she was in a good spot in her life and didn\u2019t want to \nreopen that door. Instead, she wanted to avoid the mental stress of contacting her \ncreditors and making payment arrangements for what she considered \u201cold debt.\u201d She \nconsidered the charged-off debts to be a closed issue and was not concerned with \ncontacting her creditors. Instead, she intended to simply dispute the debts. At the time \nshe explained her position, she had approximately $3,528 as a monthly remainder \navailable for paying her debts. During the period 2017 through 2021, she also had \nsufficient funds to enable her to take several tourism trips to Mexico and the Caribbean. \nIn light of Applicant\u2019s declared position and lengthy period of inaction, AG \u00b6 19(b) has \nalso been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) partially apply. Applicant\u2019s earlier financial difficulties \u2013 \nsome of which were associated with her period of unemployment (September 2014 \u2013 May \n2015), her first spouse\u2019s medical issues, and her 2017 divorce, were in some measure at \nleast somewhat beyond her control. However, upon righting her financial ship and \nreceiving funds sufficient to enable her to take tourism trips to Mexico and the Caribbean \nand start resolving at least some of her delinquent accounts, she failed to act responsibly \nunder the circumstances. Instead of doing so, she declared her charged-off debts to be \nold debts and considered them to be resolved. Applicant ignored her debts until she \nrealized that her security clearance was in jeopardy because of her inaction. On May 8, \n2023 \u2013 6 days after the SOR was issued, she negotiated settlements with her creditors \nand paid them a total of $6,776 to resolve her previously delinquent SOR-related debts \ntotaling approximately $22,588. \nAs noted above, Applicant acknowledged that, in addition to her SOR-related \ndebts, she had several other delinquent accounts that were either charged off or settled \nin the last seven years. Unalleged conduct can be considered for certain purposes, as \ndiscussed by the DOHA Appeal Board. (Conduct not alleged in an SOR may be \nconsidered: (a) to assess an applicant's credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant's evidence \nof extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to consider whether an applicant \nhas demonstrated successful rehabilitation; (d) to decide whether a particular provision \nof the Adjudicative Guidelines is applicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole-person \nanalysis under Directive \u00a7 6.3.). See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, \n2006); (citing ISCR Case No. 02-07218 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 15, 2004); ISCR Case No. \n00-0633 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2003)).

Applicant\u2019s unlisted and unalleged \ndelinquent accounts will be considered only for the five purposes listed above. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). Although Applicant self-reported and acknowledged her \ncharged-off debts, until May 2023, she made no efforts to address any of those delinquent \ndebts. It is apparent that Applicant intentionally ignored her delinquent accounts for a \nsubstantial multi-year period. The Appeal Board has previously commented on such a \nsituation: \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due \nto circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider \nwhether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing \nwith those financial difficulties. ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. \nJan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); \nISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she \nmaintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his or her financial problems only after being \nplaced on notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the \njudgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no \nimmediate threat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018) In \nthis instance, Applicant declared that she had no interest in addressing her delinquent \naccounts or dealing with her creditors and she followed that intentional path until she \nrealized that her security clearance was in peril. \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. Mere promises to pay \ndebts in the future, without further confirmed action, are insufficient. In this instance, while \nclaiming that she was currently earning enough income to pay off her charged-off debts, \nshe hesitated to do so because she was in a good spot in her life and didn\u2019t want to \nreopen that door. Instead, she wanted to avoid the mental stress of contacting her \ncreditors and making payment arrangements for what she considered \u201cold debt.\u201d She \nconsidered the charged-off debts to be a closed issue and was not concerned with \ncontacting her creditors. Instead, she intended to simply dispute the debts. And now that \nthe SOR was issued, Applicant settled the three charged-off SOR accounts for less than \ntheir balance in one day. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \nThere is no verifiable evidence of financial counseling or a budget. Applicant \nreported her current net monthly income and her monthly household expenses. She has \na substantial monthly remainder available for savings or spending. She also had sufficient \nfunds to spend on tourism trips to Mexico and the Caribbean. If she had made any good-\nfaith efforts to negotiate with her creditors over a six- or seven-year period, or to make \nany payments associated with the accounts that she acknowledged were hers, it would \nreflect positive actions by her. However, Applicant\u2019s complete inaction for all those years, \nuntil the SOR was issued, and then followed up by her settlement of those accounts for \nless than their actual balances, under the circumstances continues to cast doubt on her \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at \n3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nThere is some mitigating evidence regarding Applicant\u2019s financial considerations \nunder the whole-person concept. Applicant is a 32-year-old employee of a defense \ncontractor. She has been serving as a logistics manager since August 2015. She \npreviously served briefly in a sales position with another employer (June 2015 \u2013 August \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2015). She is a 2010 high school graduate with some college credits, but no degree. She \nenlisted in the U.S. Navy in October 2010 and served on active duty until August 2014 \nwhen she was honorably discharged as a petty officer third class logistics specialist (E-\n4). She was granted a secret clearance in 2010, and it was renewed as recently as August \n2020. Applicant\u2019s delinquent accounts were first self-reported in her SF 86 in October \n2022, and discussed in detail during her OPM interview in February 2023. She finally \nsettled for less each of her delinquent accounts, and they are now considered resolved. \nThe president of Applicant\u2019s employer wholeheartedly supports her retaining her security \nclearance.  \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. When the SOR was issued, there were three still-delinquent \ncharged-off accounts totaling approximately $22,588. Until her OPM interview, \napproximately six or seven years after the debts became delinquent, Applicant made no \nefforts to resolve any of them despite acknowledging that the debts were hers. She \nexplained her decision by claiming that she was currently earning enough income to pay \noff her charged-off debts but has hesitated to do so because she was in a good spot in \nher life and didn\u2019t want to reopen that door. Instead, she wanted to avoid the mental stress \nof contacting her creditors and making payment arrangements for what she considered \n\u201cold debt.\u201d She considered the charged-off debts to be a closed issue and was not \nconcerned with contacting her creditors. Instead, she intended to simply dispute the \ndebts. At the time she explained her position, she had approximately $3,528 as a monthly \nremainder available for paying her debts. Applicant ignored her debts until she realized \nthat her security clearance was in jeopardy because of her inaction. On May 8, 2023 \u2013 6 \ndays after the SOR was issued, she negotiated settlements with her creditors and paid \nthem a total of $6,776 to resolve her previously delinquent SOR-related debts totaling \napproximately $22,588. \nApplicant\u2019s track record of making no efforts for six or seven years to resolve the \ndebts based on her decision that she was not responsible for old debts or charged-off \ndebts, and her desire to avoid the stress of dealing with her creditors, is negative and \ndiscouraging. It was only after she realized that her security clearance was in jeopardy \nthat she settled those debts for less than she actually owed. Overall, the evidence leaves \nme with substantial questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. Accordingly, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from his financial difficulties. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through \nAG 2(d)(9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n11 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on October 14, 2022. \nOn June 8, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudication Services (DCSA CAS) sent her a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F. The DCSA CAS acted under Executive Order (Exec. \nOr.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016), which became effective \non June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on June 23, 2023, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge.

On April 8, 2024, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled \nto be conducted by video teleconference on May 7, 2024. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 8 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified but did not present the testimony of any other witnesses or \nsubmit any documentary evidence. I kept the record open until May 17, 2024, to enable \nher to submit documentary evidence. She timely submitted AX A through GG, which were \nadmitted without objection. On May 20, 2024, she submitted AX HH. Department Counsel \ndid not object to the untimely submission, and it was admitted in evidence. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on May 16, 2024. The record closed on May 20, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted all the allegations in the SOR.

(GX 5) The record does not reflect the dollar \namount of debts that were discharged. Applicant testified that this bankruptcy was the \nresult of immaturity and being \u201cstupid kids.\u201d (Tr. 18) \nIn January 2009, Applicant and her husband filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition \nand received a discharge in April 2009. (GX 4) Debts totaling about $46,538 were \ndischarged. (GX 8 at 2.) Applicant testified that the delinquent debts that were discharged \nwere incurred because Applicant and her husband were both employed by a mortgage \ncompany that failed. Her SCA reflects that she was unemployed from June to November \n2006. She testified that her husband was unemployed for about another year after she \nreturned to the workforce. (Tr. 18) \nApplicant was employed by a defense contractor when the COVID pandemic \nbegan. She testified that she became seriously ill at the beginning of the pandemic. (Tr. \n15) Her SCA reflects that she was unemployed from June 2020 to May 2021, that she left \nher job by mutual agreement following notice of unsatisfactory performance, and that her \nunsatisfactory performance was the result of absences from work due to illness.

She told the investigator that she had depleted her savings and was \nalready delinquent on numerous debts at the time of the interview. (GX 8 at 3) \nOn June 30, 2023, Applicant and her husband filed a petition for Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy. She submitted no evidence of contacts with creditors or actions to attempt \nresolution of her debts before resorting to bankruptcy. The petition listed six healthcare \ndebts for $100 or less and totaling $510; one healthcare debt for $961; sixteen credit-card \ndebts totaling $77,472; two personal loans totaling $28,655; and four collection accounts \ntotaling $6,793. It also reflects a charged-off debt of $3,034 for a travel trailer. The debt \nworksheet submitted by Applicant to the bankruptcy attorney reflects that all the credit \ncards were Applicant\u2019s and were not her husband\u2019s accounts or joint accounts. (GX 6 at \n27-30) Applicant and her husband indicated in their petition that they would continue \npayments on their home mortgage loan and two vehicles (model years 2015 and 2018). \nThey reported their combined monthly net income of $7,250 and monthly expenses of \n$5,337, leaving a net monthly remainder of $1,913. (GX 3 at 36) \nTheir bankruptcy petition was granted and a five-year payment plan was approved. \nApplicant and her husband began making monthly payments of $1,905 in July 2023. The \npayments increased to $2,255 in November 2023. (AX G; AX H) They had made ten \npayments as of the date of the hearing. (Answer to SOR; Tr. 23) \nApplicant submitted an updated personal financial statement after the hearing. It \nreflects net family income of $8,930 per month; monthly expenses of $2,505; and debt \npayments of $4,515 per month, leaving a net monthly remainder of $1,910. The debt \npayments include $1,350 for the home mortgage loan, $420 and $480 for two car \npayments, and $2,2651 to the bankruptcy trustee. (AX D; AX H) They have been making \nthese payments as agreed. (AX I-GG) \nThree of Applicant\u2019s coworkers submitted statements supporting her application to \ncontinue her security clearance. The letters reflect that she is considered as a \ncompassionate, sincere, trustworthy, and hard-working member of their team.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. \nBd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are recent and \nnumerous. Applicant provided no evidence of the specific circumstances that caused her \nto accumulate the delinquent debts reflected in her most recent bankruptcy petition. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant has been employed since May 2021. She \nsubmitted no evidence of conditions beyond her control that have occurred since she \nreturned to work. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant completed the financial counseling \nrequired by the bankruptcy court, but she has completed only ten months of a five-year \nplan. Her track record of three bankruptcy filings does not inspire confidence. The fact \nthat she has been employed since May 2021 but accumulated more than $116,000 in \ndelinquent consumer debt strongly suggests that she has not been living within her \nmeans. While her ten months of timely payments is encouraging, it falls short of \u201cclear \nindications\u201d that her financial problems are under control. I am not confident that she will \nadhere to the bankruptcy payment plan if the pressure of qualifying for a clearance is \nlifted. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant filed her bankruptcy petition on June 30, \n2023, shortly after she answered the SOR on June 23, 2023. The timing of her bankruptcy \npetition indicates that it was prompted by receipt of the SOR. Payment of debts mitigated \nby the pressure of qualifying for a security clearance is not a \u201cgood faith effort.\u201d Applicants \nwho begin to address their security-significant conduct only when their personal interests \nare at stake may be lacking in judgment and reliability. ISCR Case No. 16-01211 (App. \nBd. May 30, 2018). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by \nher history of delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.ii: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is denied. \nLeRoy F.

(\u00b6 1.a) The SOR further alleged that he used and purchased marijuana, with \nvarying frequency, from October 2020 to September 2022. (\u00b6 1.b) Applicant fully \ndisclosed his marijuana use on his November 2022 SCA. He listed that during the COVID \npandemic in 2020 while working from home, his stress was building from his work, \nmarriage, his rental properties, and home life. He also suffered from anxiety, and he used \nmarijuana to help with his insomnia. The first year of his marijuana use was about two to \nthree times a week just before he went to bed. The second year he increased his use of \nmarijuana to an almost nightly occurrence. His use of marijuana was predominantly to \nhelp him sleep. (Answer; GE 1; AE A) \nApplicant admitted that he used marijuana previously in high school, between the \nages of 16 to 17. He did not use it again until October 2020, when his stress levels were \nhigh, and he was unable to sleep. In August 2020, he also started seeing a clinical \npsychologist to obtain help with these issues that led to his use of marijuana. The \npsychologist submitted a February 2024 letter stating that Applicant received treatment \nfrom August 2020 to March 2021, and again from October 2022 to present. Applicant was \ndiagnosed with adjustment reaction disorder. The psychologist stated that \u201c[Applicant\u2019s] \nparticipation in therapy has been committed, open, honest, and hard working.

(AE A, C; Tr. 24-32) \nIn October 2020, Applicant was offered marijuana by an associate, and even \nthough he held a security clearance at the time, he nonetheless accepted the marijuana. \nApplicant admitted that he did not fully think about the significance of using marijuana, an \nillegal drug, while possessing a DOD security clearance. He stated, \u201cI couldn't find an \nescape. I couldn't find relief from the pressure and anxiety I was feeling. And at the time, \nthat felt way more significant than the consequences that may not come for years and/or \nmay never come. So that is -- I kind of overlooked the fact that I held a security clearance.\u201d \n(Tr. 34-35) \nApplicant used marijuana in vape form only before he went to bed. It helped him \nsleep throughout the night. In approximately September 2022, his supervisor revealed \nthat the company was going to sponsor him for a top secret security clearance. Applicant \nfilled out the SCA in November 2022, and he listed that his last use of marijuana occurred \nin September 2022. He made the decision to stop all marijuana use, not only for his DOD \nsecurity clearance, but for several reasons; his wife was upset that he used marijuana, \nand it caused marital strife; he wanted to be a better parent for his children; and due to \nhealth concerns. Applicant came across some medical studies of the effects THC has on \nthe brain, and he stated, \u201cstudies have shown that [THC] promotes aging, accelerated \nbrain aging, very similar to Alzheimer's patients.\u201d Applicant has not used marijuana since \nSeptember 2022, and he submitted a letter of intent to permanently abstain from all future \ndrug involvement and substance misuse. (AE B; Tr. 36-45) \nIn October 2022, Applicant resumed therapy with his psychologist, and he sees \nhim on a weekly basis. This therapy has enabled him to handle his stress more effectively. \nHe feels more mature and now views therapy in a positive light that promotes a sense of \nwell-being. Applicant continues to receive benefits in therapy, and he plans to remain in \ntreatment for the foreseeable future. (Tr. 45-46; AE C) \nApplicant provided his 2023 employee performance review. The comments from \nthree different evaluators for the annual review described Applicant as a key leader, \nexpert, and a great listener. One evaluator wrote, \u201cI\u2019m confident when [Applicant\u2019s] \nworking on a job it will be done right.\u201d Applicant also submitted documentation of his 2018 \naward of a coveted and prestigious award in the industry. In December 2023, he was \nselected by his employer into a program that recognizes him as an elite technical talent \nstaff member. Applicant submitted a character reference letter from the production \nmanager at his place of employment. The production manager has known Applicant for \nover 20 years, and attests to his impeccable character. He finds Applicant to be a person \nof strong moral value and fully dedicated to his family, friends, company, and country. \n(AE D, F, G, J) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse  \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern for drug involvement: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances . . . can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations.  \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 25 \nand the following are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse;  \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia; and \nAG \u00b6 25(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information \nor holding a sensitive position. \nApplicant used and purchased marijuana, with varying frequency, from about \nOctober 2020 to September 2022, while in possession of a DOD security clearance and \nholding a sensitive position. The above disqualifying conditions apply.  \nI have considered the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26. The following are \npotentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed a statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement or substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibly. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn October 2020, Applicant started to use marijuana to help with his insomnia, and \nhe increased his use to almost daily in 2022. He last used marijuana in September 2022, \nand he fully disclosed his marijuana usage on the November 2022 SCA. He has provided \nevidence of actions taken to overcome his problem. He has been involved in weekly \ntherapy sessions to the present time, which has enabled him to effectively deal with \nmounting stress and pressure. He has matured, and he has made his family, career, and \ncommunity a priority in his life. Over two years have passed since he last used marijuana, \nand Applicant credibly stated that he had no intent to use any illegal drugs in the future. \nHe submitted a letter of intent to permanently abstain from all future drug involvement \nand substance misuse. Mitigating conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H and the AG \u00b6 2(d) factors in this \nwhole-person analysis. \nThe Federal government must be able to repose a high degree of trust and \nconfidence in persons granted access to classified information. In deciding whether to \ngrant or continue access to classified information, the Federal government can take into \naccount facts and circumstances of an applicant's personal life that shed light on the \nperson's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. Furthermore, security clearance \ndecisions are not limited to consideration of an applicant's conduct during work or duty \nhours. Even if an applicant has a good work record, his off-duty conduct or circumstances \ncan have security significance and may be considered in evaluating the applicant's \nnational security eligibility. \nApplicant made positive changes in his life, which are fully supported by his 2023 \nemployee performance evaluation, to include words of support from his production \nmanager. He is the 2018 recipient of a coveted award in the industry, and he was recently \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrecognized as an elite technical talent staff member by his current employer. He is \ncommitted to remaining drug-free, and I find his future use of marijuana is unlikely to \nrecur. After evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

It was work-related and the level of the briefing \nwas secret. (Tr. 28-30) \nApplicant admits to purchasing two Percocet tablets and trying them in October \n2016. He was 20 and it was the only time he used Percocet. (Tr. 28) In January 2017, \nApplicant used the prescription drug Vicodin without a prescription to treat pain caused \nby an orthodontic treatment. A friend gave him the pill. It was the only time he took \nVicodin. It relieved his mouth pain. (Tr. 49-50) \nApplicant started using marijuana in July 2012 when he was 16 and in high \nschool. He used marijuana on a frequent basis during his college years between 2014 \nand 2018. In his October 2022 e-QIP, he states he used marijuana at social gatherings. \nHe estimates he used marijuana at least 75 times since his first use of marijuana. From \n2018 to 2020, he estimates he used marijuana infrequently, around 3 or 4 times during \nthis two-year timeframe. This occurred at social gatherings when a joint was being \npassed around. He stopped smoking marijuana in 2020. (Tr. 10, 32-35) Applicant only \npurchased marijuana on one occasion in July 2014. He purchased about 2 grams of \nmarijuana from another student when he was in high school. He used the marijuana \nwith his friends. He denies purchasing marijuana between 2018 and 2020. (Tr. 23, 44; \nGE 3 at 26) \nFrom 2020 to early 2022, Applicant used cannabidiol (CBD)-low THC \nsupplements as a sleep aid and anxiety reducer. He has anxiety and sleep issues. He \ndid not experience any psychoactive effects from the CBD supplements, but they \nhelped him sleep. He stopped using them in March 2022. He found other ways to deal \nwith his anxiety and sleep issues. He has matured and has become a provider for \nhimself and his fianc\u00e9. (Tr. 10-11, 38-43; GE 1 at 27-28) \nOn his 2018 security clearance application, Applicant stated that he did not \nintend to use marijuana in the future. He indicated that he did not enjoy using it very \nmuch and it was not worth losing a job. (GE 3, Section 23, at 25) During the hearing, he \nadmitted that despite his intentions, he used marijuana on 3-4 occasions between 2018 \nand early 2020. He said he did not respect the guidelines regarding marijuana use and \nrationalized that it was okay because he used marijuana responsibly. He testified that \nhe learned to appreciate the guidelines more because he understands them better and \nthe reasons for them.

(AE D- AE E) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nDOD and Federal Government Policy on Marijuana Use \nOn October 25, 2014, the Director for National Intelligence, issued a \nmemorandum titled, \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use\u201d addressing \nconcerns raised by the decriminalization of marijuana use in several states and the \nDistrict of Columbia. The memorandum states that changes to state and local laws do \nnot alter the existing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines. \u201cAn individual\u2019s \ndisregard for federal law pertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana \nremains adjudicatively relevant in national security determinations.\u201d \nOn May 26, 2015, the Director of the United States Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) issued a memorandum titled, \u201cFederal Laws and Policies \nProhibiting Marijuana Use.\u201d The Director of OPM acknowledged that several \njurisdictions have decriminalized the use of marijuana, allowing the use of marijuana for \nmedicinal purposes and/or for limited recreational use but states that Federal law on \nmarijuana remains unchanged. Marijuana is categorized as a controlled substance \nunder Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. Thus, knowing or intentional \nmarijuana possession is illegal, even if the individual has no intent to manufacture, \ndistribute, or dispense marijuana. \nOn December 21, 2021, the Director of National Intelligence signed the \nmemorandum, Security Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for \nAgencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position. It emphasizes that \nfederal law remains unchanged with respect to the illegal use, possession, production, \nand distribution of marijuana. Individuals who hold a clearance or occupy a sensitive \nposition are prohibited by law from using controlled substances. Disregard of federal law \npertaining to marijuana (including prior recreational marijuana use) remains relevant, \nbut not determinative, to adjudications of eligibility. Agencies are required to use the \n\u201cwhole-person concept\u201d stated under SEAD 4, to determine whether the applicant\u2019s \nbehavior raises a security concern that has not been mitigated. \nThe December 21, 2021, memo also states the use of CBD products may be \nrelevant to adjudication in accordance with SEAD 4.

Additionally, \nagencies should be aware that the percentage of THC cannot be guaranteed, thus \nposing a concern pertaining to the use of a CBD product under federal law. Studies \nhave shown that some CBD products exceed the 0.3 percent THC threshold for hemp, \nnotwithstanding advertising labels. Therefore, there is a risk that using these products \nmay nonetheless cause sufficiently high levels of THC to result in a positive marijuana \ntest under agency-administered employment of random drug testing programs. Should \nan individual test positive, they will be subject to an investigation under specific \nguidelines established by their home agency. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in \nAG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription drug and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other \nsubstances that cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a \nmanner inconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find the following drug involvement disqualifying conditions potentially apply \nto Applicant\u2019s case. \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse; and \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia. \nThe SOR alleges and Applicant admits he used marijuana on various occasions \nfrom 2012 to 2020. He also admits to using Percocet in 2016 and Vicodin in 2017 \nwithout a prescription. He used marijuana on a regular basis during college. His \nmarijuana use tapered off upon his graduation from college when Applicant began to \nfocus on his career. He admits to smoking marijuana on 3-4 occasions between \nNovember 2018 to 2020, after he was granted a security clearance.

AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and \n25(c) apply. \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement. The burden shifted to Applicant \nto produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. \n(Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and \nthe burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. September 22, 2005)) \nGuideline H also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from drug involvement. The following mitigating conditions apply to the \nApplicant\u2019s case: \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) applies because Applicant last smoked marijuana in 2020, \napproximately four years ago. He last used CBD-low THC supplements in March 2022, \nabout two years ago. His use of Percocet was experimental and occurred over eight \nyears ago. His use of Vicodin was for pain treatment and only occurred once more than \nseven years ago. Applicant stopped using illegal marijuana and CBD-low level THC \nproducts on his own. He has matured and sufficient time has passed to conclude his \nconduct is unlikely to recur. He fully disclosed his marijuana use on his March 2022 \nsecurity clearance application. His disclosures demonstrate that he is reliable and \ntrustworthy. It is unlikely he will use marijuana in the future. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) applies. Applicant acknowledged his illegal drug use on his most \nrecent security clearance application and during the hearing. He has established a \npattern of abstinence. The last time he smoked marijuana was over four years ago. It is \nunlikely Applicant\u2019s use of a CBD-low THC supplement caused psychoactive effects. \nHowever, the amount of THC was .5% which is above the legal cut-off level. \nconsidered this but also considered that he stopped using these supplements two years \nago. \n8 \nI \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \nWhile Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9 continues to use marijuana, she avoids using marijuana \nin front of Applicant.

He \nacknowledged that any future use of illegal drugs may result in the revocation of his \nsecurity clearance. \nApplicant was forthcoming about his marijuana use on his security clearance \napplication and during the hearing. He admits he was wrong when he used marijuana \nbetween 2018 and 2020 after being granted a security clearance. He stopped smoking \nmarijuana in 2020 and stopped using CBD-low THC supplements in March 2022. He \ndemonstrated an appropriate period of abstinence. While Applicant used marijuana at \nvarious times over a period of 10 years, his use was highest during his college years. \nHe has not smoked marijuana in over four years. He met his burden to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns raised under Guideline H, Drug Involvement. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during the national \nsecurity or adjudicative processes. . . . \nThe following disqualifying condition under AG \u00b6 16 potentially apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, \nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \nApplicant\u2019s past illegal marijuana use from high school (2014) to at least 2020 \nraise a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, unreliability, unwillingness \nto comply with rules and regulations. In particular, his decision to continue using \nmarijuana after being granted a security clearance indicates he has issues with \nfollowing rules and regulations. He continued to use marijuana after indicating his intent \nto stop using marijuana on his April 2018 security clearance application. His history of \nmarijuana use raises concerns under AG \u00b6 16(c) about his judgment, trustworthiness, \nreliability, and ability to properly safeguard classified information. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n    \n          \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns.

I considered that he was young \nand just starting out in the civilian employment world. He fully disclosed his illegal \nmarijuana use on his October 2022 security clearance application. He accepts full \nresponsibility for his poor choices. He stopped smoking marijuana approximately four \nyears ago in 2020. He stopped using the CBD-low THC supplements two years ago in \nMarch 2022. Applicant has matured and his current employer speaks highly of him. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17 (d) apply. He mitigated the concerns raised under the Personal \nConduct Concern. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nThere are reasons that support not granting a security clearance to Applicant. \nQuestions are raised about Applicant\u2019s judgment because of his admitted history of \nillegal drug use as well his decision to use marijuana after being granted a security \nclearance.

He fully disclosed his marijuana use on his October 2022 security clearance \napplication. He has not smoked marijuana since 2020 and he has not used CBD-low \nTHC supplements since March 2022. He signed a statement of intent to refrain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse and acknowledged that any future substance \nmisuse could result in the revocation of his security clearance. Applicant has built a \nsuccessful career and is highly regarded at his place of employment. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has learned a significant \nlesson. While his marijuana use showed poor judgment, especially after being granted a \nsecurity clearance, he fully disclosed his marijuana use on his most recent security \nclearance application. He accepted responsibility and expressed remorse over his \ndecision to use marijuana after being granted a security clearance. I considered that his \nmarijuana use between 2018 and 2020 was infrequent, only 3 to 4 times in social \nsettings. He learned from his mistake in judgment and took steps to demonstrate his \nintent to refrain from illegal marijuana use. Applicant is aware that should he illegally \nuse marijuana in the future, it is likely that his security clearance will be revoked. \nConcerns raised by Applicant\u2019s illegal marijuana use are mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Tr. 28-38; GE 1, 2, 6, 7) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s six delinquent accounts totaling \napproximately $57,000. These delinquent accounts consist of a personal loan (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a), credit cards (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e), an automobile loan (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and an \nautomobile insurance premium (SOR \u00b6 1.f). He admitted all the SOR allegations listed \nunder Guideline F with additional comments. I have incorporated his admissions in my \nfindings of fact. The Guideline F SOR allegations are established by his admissions, the \nGovernment\u2019s 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 credit reports, and Applicant\u2019s 2024 credit \nreport. (Answer; GE 2-5, 8; AE A) \nThe delinquent personal loan in the amount of $22,427 alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a has \nnot been resolved. Applicant opened this account in about January 2017 to consolidate \nsome of his second wife\u2019s debt. He is the sole accountholder. He became delinquent on \nthe account in about October 2019 when his second marriage began to fail, and his \nchild support payments increased from about $1,400 per month to about $3,100 per \nmonth. He also paid for his ex-wife\u2019s rental apartment between his legal separation and \nthe finalization of the divorce. The creditor charged off the account in approximately \nFebruary 2020. (Tr. 30, 49-59; Answer; GE 2-5, 8; AE A) \nAfter Applicant became delinquent on the account, he claimed that he had a \npayment arrangement with the creditor and made payments for a few months prior to \nthe pandemic, when he stopped making payments. He claimed that he attempted to \narrange payments with the creditor several times during the pandemic, but the creditor \nwould not work with him. He also claimed that the creditor contacted him in November \n2021, 2022, and 2023, to attempt to resolve the account. He claimed he asked the \ncreditor for written proof of the debt each time they contacted him, but they did not \nprovide it. He provided no documents evidencing his resolution efforts. He last made a \npayment on this debt in January 2020. In February 2022, he told the DOD investigator \nthat he would not satisfy this account because his second wife used the car that \nsecured the account.

He claimed that he only became aware the account was delinquent when \nhe had his February 2022 security interview, and the DOD investigator brought it to his \nattention. He also acknowledged receiving phone calls from the creditor about this \ndelinquent account in November 2021, 2022, and 2023. He claimed he asked the \ncreditor for written proof of the debt each time they contacted him, but they did not \nprovide it.

He provided no documents \nconcerning his resolution of the debt or the alleged unauthorized charges on the \naccount. He claimed the creditor would not provide him with any documents regarding \nthe account. He acknowledged that he was assigned the debt as part of his second \ndivorce. During his February 2022 security interview, he told the DOD investigator that \nhe would not satisfy this debt even if an investigation revealed that he is responsible for \nthe charges on the account. During the hearing, he testified he will satisfy the debt. The \nlast payment on this account was made in August 2018. (Tr. 25, 32-37, 59-67; Answer; \nGE 2-5, 8; AE A) \nThe delinquent automobile loan in the amount of $11,676 alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c \nhas not been resolved. Applicant opened the account in November 2015, to finance the \npurchase of a vehicle. He became delinquent on the account in about January 2018. He \nclaims that he and his second wife had an agreement that she would pay the account, \nbut she did not. The creditor repossessed the vehicle in February 2018. Applicant was \naware that the vehicle was repossessed in spring 2018, because his second wife called \nhim when it happened. He claimed he did not know that the account was delinquent \nuntil right before the creditor repossessed it. He claimed he tried to resolve the account \nprior to the repossession, but he could not afford the payments the creditor required. In \nJanuary 2024, he contacted the creditor about paying the account, but he is allegedly \nwaiting on the creditor\u2019s legal department to weigh in because the account is charged \noff. Part of the reason he waited until January 2024 to resolve the account was that he \nwanted his second wife to pay it despite knowing he is ultimately responsible. During his \nFebruary 2022 security interview, he told the DOD investigator that he would not satisfy \nthis debt. He claimed that sometime prior to the hearing, he changed his mind and \nclaimed that he will satisfy it. He provided no documents related to his resolution efforts \nof this account. (Tr. 26, 68-84; Answer; GE 2-5, 8) \nThe delinquent credit card in the amount of $5,009 alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d has not \nbeen resolved. Applicant opened the account in October 2007. He became delinquent \non the account in September 2019, and the creditor charged off the account in May \n2020. Applicant claimed that about $4,000 of the balance on the account accrued \nthrough fraudulent charges that he did not authorize. He acknowledged that about \n$1,000 of the balance on the account is valid and his responsibility. He claimed that in \nNovember 2018, he noticed charges on his statement that he did not recognize. He \ntestified the charges were made in a different location than where he was at the time. \nHe stated that he filed a formal dispute with the creditor, but they investigated it and \ndetermined that Applicant was responsible for the charges for unknown reasons. He \nclaimed that he appealed the decision pursuant to his cardholder agreement, but his \nappeal was denied. He also claimed that he disputed the debt with the credit reporting \nagencies.

(Tr. 25-26, 32-38, 41-48; Answer; GE 2) \nApplicant has approximately $310,000 in two bank accounts. He has an \ninvestment account with a balance of more than $200,000. He has another investment \naccount with a balance of about $10,000, and a retirement account with a balance of \nabout $50,000.

However, for his own financial security, he will not \nmake lump sum payments of more than $10,000. He has no payment plans in place \nwith any of the SOR creditors. (Tr. 26, 108-116) \nApplicant has completed several clearance applications in the past. Despite \nbeing required to do so, he failed to divulge the delinquent SOR accounts in his \nNovember 2021 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing (2021 e-QIP). \nThese failures were not alleged in the SOR. In February 2022, during his security \nclearance interview, a DOD investigator confronted him with these delinquencies and \nothers after Applicant failed to volunteer them. Just four months later, despite having \nbeen told about these delinquencies, and despite being required to do so, Applicant \nfailed to divulge the delinquent SOR debts in his May 2022 Electronic Questionnaires \nfor Investigations Processing (2022 e-QIP). (Tr. 117-128; Answer; GE 1, 2, 6, 7) \nIn August 2022, during a security interview with another DOD investigator, \nApplicant again failed to volunteer the SOR delinquencies.

Under \nGuideline E, the Government alleged his deliberate failure to list these delinquent debts \nin his 2022 e-QIP in SOR \u00b6 2.a. In SOR \u00b6 2.b, it alleged he deliberately falsified material \nfacts to a DOD investigator during his August 2022 interview when he claimed that he \nwas unaware of the SOR delinquencies.

He claimed he forgot about the accounts. He claimed he thought they were \nmore than seven years old. Despite certifying its accuracy, he now thinks the August \n2022 security interview summary is not accurate because he thinks he told the \ninvestigator that he recognized the SOR accounts.

Moreover, despite discussing these debts in February 2022 with a DOD \ninvestigator, and acknowledging his awareness of these debts, he deliberately misled \nanother DOD investigator in August 2022, when he claimed he had no knowledge of \nthese debts. (GE 1, 2) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective within DOD on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.

The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had six delinquent financial accounts totaling approximately $57,000. \nHe has been delinquent on these accounts for several years. The above disqualifying \nconditions are established. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20.

I therefore cannot find \nthat they are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies were caused by divorce, unemployment, and \nunderemployment. These conditions were largely beyond his control. However, he must \nalso show that he acted responsibly under the circumstances with respect to these \ndebts. It is reasonable to expect Applicant to present documentation about the \nresolution of specific debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, \n2016). He failed to provide documentary evidence that he meaningfully addressed or \ndisputed any of the established SOR debts. Despite having a significant amount of \nmoney in savings, he has not resolved or made a payment arrangement on the debts \nthat he agrees he owes. He therefore did not provide sufficient evidence that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or made a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) do not apply. \nApplicant has undergone financial counseling and apparently has a developed a \nsignificant amount of savings and investments. These factors tend to show that his \nfinancial problems are being resolved or are under control. However, his failure to \nresolve even the debts that he does not dispute undermines the applicability of this \nmitigating factor. AG \u00b6 20(c) partially applies. \nApplicant claimed that he does not owe a portion of the total balance in SOR \u00b6 \n1.d and the full balance of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e, because there were fraudulent \ncharges on these accounts. If true, this would be a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of all or a portion of those past-due debts.

However, these debts still appear on his February 2024 credit report. In a \nsimilar case, the Appeal Board held that when an applicant claimed he disputed debts, \nand those debts were removed from a credit report, without causation between dispute \nand removal, there was insufficient evidence to meet the requirements of MC 20(e)'s \nsecond evidentiary option. ISCR Case No. 20-03691 (App. Bd. March 29, 2023). Given \nthe holding from that Appeal Board Decision, I cannot find that uncorroborated evidence \nof disputes without removal from credit reports meets that evidentiary requirement. AG \u00b6 \n20(e) does not apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity eligibility determination, or other government official. \nApplicant deliberately omitted his delinquent debts from his 2022 e-QIP. He \nmisled a DOD investigator in August 2022 when he claimed he had no knowledge of \nthese debts. Both disqualifying conditions are established. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply in Applicant's case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \nApplicant did not correct his omission of his financial delinquencies prior to being \nconfronted with the facts. Instead, he continued to misrepresent his delinquencies in \nanother e-QIP and to another DOD investigator. AG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply. \nDeliberately omitting required information from an e-QIP and lying to a DOD \ninvestigator are not minor. Instead, these actions strike at the heart of the security \nclearance process, which relies on candid and honest reporting. Applicant engaged in \nthis deceitful and misleading activity multiple times. Therefore, he has not shown that \nhis behavior was infrequent, happened under unique circumstances, or is unlikely to \nrecur. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply. \nApplicant has not acknowledged his dishonest behavior. Instead, he has \nprovided illogical excuses and explanations for his misrepresentations that strain \ncredulity. Moreover, for the reasons I provided in my analysis of AG \u00b6 17(c), I cannot \nfind his behavior is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 17(d) does not apply. None of the Guideline E \nmitigating conditions are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations or personal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

(Item 4 at 7, 16.) \nSOR \u00b6 2.b: Applicant illegally downloaded television shows, movies, e-\nbooks, and video games estimated to be valued at $54,000, from his personal \ncomputer from about 2011 to present without authorization. Applicant admits the \nallegation. In his Response he clarifies that he has not been continuously downloading \nillegal content since 2011. He breaks down the times he illegally downloaded material \nand explains where there were multi-year gaps. He started downloading sometime \nbetween 2011 and 2015 and was \u201chalted again\u201d after his security clearance interview in \nJuly 2022 so it was \u201conly 15 years total, with a 6-year break in the middle\u201d vice 20 years. \n(Response at 2; Item 4.) He provides a detailed breakdown of the items in his Response \nto get to the $54,000 figure and then notes that with subscription services the present-\nday value according to his breakdown is $6,360. He notes he voluntarily reported these \nin his interview. (Response at 2; Item 3 at 17; Item 4 at 7, 16.) He explains in his Response \nthat his \u201cillegal downloading in general has just been a hobby, not a habit, which makes \nit easy to halt.\u201d Now that he is aware of the implications to his security clearance, he has \nmade efforts to halt any illegal downloading and deleted any illegal content from his \ncomputers. (Response at 3.) \nSOR \u00b6 2.c: Applicant loaded a Tor Internet browser onto his personal laptop, \nbetween 2015 and 2018 and accessed an illegal marketplace on the dark web where \nhe viewed pictures on sale of women that were taken without their consent. \nApplicant admits the allegation. He states in his Answer and Response this was a onetime \nevent that occurred one evening somewhere between 2015 and 2018. He thought \u201cthe \ndark web would have strange-but-benign websites to explore, though the links were \nsometimes unlabeled. That website was an \u201cuncomfortable experience,\u201d and he states \nhe does not intend to go back to the Tor browser, the dark web, or to similar websites \never again. (Answer; Item 4 at 16-17.) There is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s accessing \nthe dark web was illegal. He stated in response to Government interrogatories that his \naccessing of the dark web was not part of a search for illegal content or to commit illegal \nacts. There is no evidence he used the dark web to sell or purchase illegal firearms, drugs, \npornography, stolen passwords, hacked credit card account numbers, or other illegal \nitems associated with the dark web. He stated in the Government interrogatories he \nthought the worst thing he saw on the dark web was a site selling pictures of adult women \nwithout their consent and affirmed he \u201cdid not purchase anything, nor view illegal content.\u201d \n(Item 3 at 19.) He repeatedly denied to the investigator viewing any type of illegal \npornography. (Item 4 at 17.) \nSOR \u00b6 2.d: Applicant illegally or when otherwise not authorized duplicated \nvideo games for LAN parties in about September 2001. Applicant admits the \nallegation.

See the facts discussed in subparagraphs 2.a through \n2.d above. As mitigation he cites the unusual circumstances of the downloading generally \noccurring when he was a student when he had little income. As an indication of his \nrehabilitation, he notes \u201cstopped any kind of illegal or gray-area downloading [in October \n2022], and [he] has no interest in continuing.\u201d (Response at 3.) \nAs further mitigation Applicant offers in his Response that he is an honest person. \nHe achieved \u201clife rank\u201d in the Boy Scouts. He abided by the alcohol laws and did not drink \nuntil he was 21 years old. He has never gotten a parking ticket or tried illegal drugs or \nmarijuana. As a teaching assistant, he was entrusted with students\u2019 grades. (Response \nat 3.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information.

Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15- 01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . Affluence that cannot be explained \nby known sources of income is also a security concern insofar as it may \nresult from criminal activity, including espionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the record establish the \nfollowing disqualifying condition under AG \u00b6 19: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s unfiled tax returns are recent and did not \noccur under circumstances making them unlikely to recur. He has not demonstrated he \nhas acted responsibly. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant attributed his tax issues to a \nmisunderstanding of the tax laws. A condition possibly beyond his control but he did not \nfile his Federal tax returns once he became aware he was wrong. He has not acted \nresponsibly. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) is not established. Applicant offered no evidence he had filed his tax \nreturns for the years in question or was working with a tax preparer as he claimed. His \nFederal tax-account transcripts reflect no tax returns filed. Applicant\u2019s repeated failure to \nfulfill his legal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and \nreliability required of those granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 15-08782 at 3 (App. Bd.

Information Technology includes any computer-based, mobile, \nor wireless device used to create, store, access, process, manipulate, \nprotect, or move information. This includes any component, whether \nintegrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, software, or \nfirmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 40. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) unauthorized entry into any information technology system; \n(d) downloading, storing, or transmitting classified, sensitive, proprietary, or \nother protected information on or to any unauthorized information \ntechnology system; and \n(f) introduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, software, or \nmedia to or from any information technology system when prohibited by \nrules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations or when otherwise not \nauthorized. \nOver a period of many years, Applicant admitted he illegally downloaded \nproprietary information. He admits accessed an illegal marketplace on the dark web. \nAG \u00b6 41 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered all \nof the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 41 including: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened \nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 40(a) is not established for the proprietary material (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.b). \nApplicant has not demonstrated he has acted responsibly. This illegal conduct is \nreoccurring. He was warned in 2005 by University (X) that his behavior not only violated \nits policy but was theft of intellectual policy. He continued the conduct up until as recently \nas 2022. \nAG \u00b6 40(a) is established SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c and 2.d. SOR \u00b6 2.c was a one-time event, \nwhich occurred at least six years or more years ago. Sufficient time has elapsed since \nApplicant\u2019s behavior happened.

Sufficient time has elapsed since Applicant\u2019s behavior happened. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern for criminal conduct: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable as detailed in AG \u00b6 \n31: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant acknowledges his actions. The above disqualifying condition applies. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable as detailed in AG \u00b6 \n32: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the offense; \nand \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited to, \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6 32(a), (c), and (d) do not apply. Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct continued \ndespite a reprimand and continued until at least his security clearance interview in 2022. \nHe has detailed his actions and the value of his criminal conduct. His criminal conduct \ncontinues to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. The above mitigating conditions, \nindividually or collectively, are insufficient to alleviate those concerns, given his history of \nusing information systems to obtain proprietary or other protected information in violation \nof copyrights. He needs to establish a longer record of responsible behavior and \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncompliance with rules, regulations, and the law before his criminal conduct can be \nconsidered mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines F, M, and J in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered the \naccomplishments and traits Applicant cited in his Response. Because Applicant \nrequested a determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to \nevaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 \nat 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions \nunder Guidelines F, M, and J and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his \nconduct. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2: Guideline M:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.c and 2.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3: Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.

Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson's self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are established by the evidence: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(d) do not apply. Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies are \nongoing and unresolved. He has been employed since November 2021. It is well-\nestablished that the timing of debt payments is a relevant consideration for a judge to \ndeliberate whether an applicant has acted in a reasonable and responsible manner in \naddressing financial problems. For example, to receive full credit under Mitigating \nCondition 20(d), an applicant must initiate and adhere \u201cto a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(d). He has stated his intentions \nto act but has not resolved any debts. See ISCR Case No. 08-06058 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. \n21, 2009). He has not provided documentary evidence of payments or other action on the \ndebts alleged in the SOR. He has not established that he has made a good-faith effort to \npay or resolve his debts or shown that he has acted in a reasonable and responsible \nmanner in addressing these financial problems. \nApplicant attributes his debts to a period of unemployment and divorce. The first \nprong of AG \u00b6 20(b) therefore applies. For full consideration under AG \u00b6 20(b), however, \nApplicant must establish that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. He has not \ndone so. Even if Applicant\u2019s debts occurred largely due to circumstances beyond his \ncontrol, he did not provide sufficient evidence that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances to resolve them. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant's eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant's conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): (1) the nature, extent, \nand seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                    \n \n \n \n \n   \n                    \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclearance.

Applicant received the FORM on December 5, 2023, and she did not \nrespond. The case was assigned to me on March 6, 2024. The Government\u2019s \ndocuments identified as Items 1 through 6 are admitted in evidence without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations in her Answer, with explanations. She \nis 47 years old. She married in 2003, divorced in 2006, remarried in 2012, divorced in \n2015, and remarried in 2019. She has five children, ages 28, 27, 23, 18, and 13, and \ntwo stepchildren, ages 18 and 15. She resides in state A with her spouse in his home. \n(Items 1-3) \nApplicant graduated from high school in 1994. She worked for various non-\ndefense contractors from May 2005 to May 2019. She has since worked as a project \nmanager for her employer, a defense contractor. She has never held a security \nclearance. (Items 1-3) \nApplicant used marijuana, with varying frequency, from March 2020 to at least \nSeptember 2022. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) She disclosed information regarding her marijuana use \non her June 2022 security clearance application (SCA). She was issued a medical \nmarijuana card by state A in approximately March 2020, for \u201cPTSD, Anxiety & Physical \nTrauma\u201d pain management due to two car accidents. At the time, she sought from her \npain-management physician an alternative method of treating her chronic pain than \nprescribed oxycodone or muscle relaxers. She was referred to a physician who \nauthorized and provided her with a medical marijuana card to purchase from a \ndispensary and micro dose, as needed. She stated in her SCA \u201cTo obtain clearance I \ncan revisit pain management for other methods of treatment that are federally legal.\u201d \nShe was aware that while marijuana was legal in state A, it remained federally illegal. In \nher Answer, she stated that she allowed her marijuana card to expire, she had not since \npurchased marijuana, and she did not have any intention to purchase marijuana in the \nfuture. (Items 2-3) \nApplicant has nine delinquent consumer debts totaling approximately $18,500. \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.i) She also filed chapter 7 bankruptcy in September 2012, and her \nbankruptcy was discharged in January 2013. (SOR \u00b6 2.j) The allegations are \nestablished by Applicant\u2019s admissions in her Answer, SCA, and credit bureau reports \n(CBRs) from July 2022, January 2023, and November 2023. (Items 2-6) \nApplicant stated in her Answer that she \u201cdid not have enough knowledge prior to \n[her bankruptcy] filing and deemed it a mistake.\u201d She further stated, \u201cI have worked to \npay most of the debt that was impacted.\u201d She disclosed the debt in SOR \u00b6 2.a, an auto \nloan in collection for $11,470, on her SCA. She incurred this debt in approximately \n2018, when she totaled her car in an accident and consequently owed more on the loan \nthan the car was worth. She was awaiting a settlement, which she intended to use to \nresolve this debt.

She also stated that she \nestablished payment arrangements for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.c-2.d and 2.f, and she \nanticipated paying them by August 2023. She did not provide documentation to \ncorroborate her claims. There is no evidence in the record that she has received \nfinancial counseling. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the \nGovernment must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and \nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by the applicant \nor proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion \nto obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Section 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse as: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \u201c(a) any substance misuse . . . ;\u201d and \n\u201c(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, processing, \nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.\u201d \nApplicant used marijuana from March 2020 to September 2022. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and \n25(c) are established. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides the following potentially relevant mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nApplicant self-reported information about her marijuana use on her SCA. She \nacknowledged that her use of marijuana violated federal law, despite its legality in her \nstate and her possession of a medical marijuana card. She has allowed her card to \nexpire and intends to explore alternative options to manage her pain. She expressed \nher intent to abstain from marijuana in her Answer. AG \u00b6 26(b) applies. However, more \ntime without marijuana use is necessary to establish her future abstinence from \nmarijuana use and possession. None of the remaining mitigating conditions are \nestablished. \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered as relevant AG \u00b6 19(a), an \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \n\u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Applicant has a history of not \npaying her debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nOf the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20, I have determined the following to be \nrelevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to her delinquent debts; \nhowever, she failed to show that she acted responsibly under her circumstances. She \nhas not provided documentation of her efforts to address or pay her delinquent debts. \nThere is no evidence that she has received credit counseling. There are not clear \nindications that her financial problems are being resolved or are under control. I find that \nApplicant\u2019s ongoing financial problems continue to cast doubt on her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) are not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H and Guideline F in this whole-person analysis. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. I conclude Applicant did not mitigate the financial considerations and \ndrug involvement and substance misuse security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 1, 2022, Applicant completed and signed an Electronic \nQuestionnaires for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) or security clearance application \n(SCA). (Government Exhibit (GE) 1) On June 8, 2023, the Department of Defense (DOD) \nissued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under Executive Order (Exec.

On September 22, 2023, \nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice, setting the hearing \nfor October 11, 2023. (HE 1) The hearing was held as scheduled. \nDepartment Counsel offered three exhibits into evidence; Applicant did not offer \nany exhibits into evidence; there were no objections; and all proffered exhibits were \nadmitted into evidence. (Transcript (Tr.) 10, 15-16; GE 1-GE 3) On October 20, 2023, \nDOHA received a transcript of the hearing. \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits and transcript. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, \n2.a, 2.b, and 2.c. (HE 3) He also provided mitigating information. His admissions are \naccepted as findings of fact. Additional findings follow. \nApplicant is 27 years old, and he works in imagery and artificial intelligence, and \nhis current employer has employed him for 17 months. (Tr. 6, 8, 17-18) In 2012, he \nreceived a general education degree (GED). (Tr. 6, 17) He has not attended college, and \nhe has not served in the military. (Tr. 7) He has never married, and he does not have any \nchildren. (Tr. 8)  \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about \nNovember 2012 to at least October 2022. He first used marijuana when he was 16 years \nold, and for the last two or three years, he used marijuana three or four times a week. (Tr. \n19-20) He most recently used marijuana three weeks before his hearing. (Tr. 19) \nRecreational and medical use of marijuana have not been illegal under state law in his \nstate of residence since January 2022. (Tr. 20) He has friends and family who use \nmarijuana, and he is in an environment where marijuana is used. (Tr. 21)  \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges Applicant used cocaine or crack cocaine with varying frequency \nfrom about July 2019 to at least May 2021. He did not use cocaine before July 2019 or \nafter May 2021. (Tr. 23-24) He used cocaine about 10 times. (Tr. 25) He used cocaine \nwith his former partner and his brother. (Tr. 24) He has no intent to use cocaine in the \nfuture. (Tr. 24) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges Applicant intends to use marijuana in the future. At the time \nApplicant completed his November 1, 2022 SCA, was interviewed by an Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM) investigator on December 8, 2022, and responded to the \nSOR on July 28, 2023, he promised to stop using marijuana if he received a security \n2 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclearance. (Tr. 23; HE 3; GE 1) At his hearing, he said he is more mature now, and he \ndoes not intend to use marijuana in the future. (Tr. 22) Applicant instructed his friends not \nto give him illegal drugs or drug paraphernalia even if he asks for them. (Tr. 29) \nPersonal Conduct \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges the information in SOR \u00b6 1 and its subparagraphs, supra. \nSOR \u00b6 2.b alleges Applicant used an inhalant (amyl nitrate), which is illegal under \nstate law, with varying frequency from about October 2019 until at least September 2022. \nApplicant said he used inhalants of either amyl nitrate or isobutyl nitrate until around \nSeptember 2023, which was about four weeks before his hearing. (Tr. 25-26) He used \nthe inhalant about once a week. (GE 1 at 40) He acknowledged that his use of the inhalant \nwas illegal under the state law where he resides. (Tr. 27) \nSOR \u00b6 2.c alleges Applicant intends to use illegal inhalants in the future. At his \nhearing, he said he does not intend to use inhalants or illegal drugs in the future. (Tr. 28, \n30) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \n3 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 provides the security concern arising from drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse stating: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises questions \nabout a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) any substance misuse (see above definition)\u201d; \u201c(c) illegal \npossession of a controlled substance. . . .\u201d; and \u201c(g) expressed intent to continue drug \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \ninvolvement and substance misuse.\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), 25(c), and \n25(g). Additional discussion is in the mitigation section, infra. \nAG \u00b6 26 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b).   \nPossession of Schedule I or II controlled substances is a federal criminal offense. \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act, are \ncontained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c). Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance and \ncocaine is a Schedule II controlled substance.

The \nSecEA has provided direction in [the adjudicative guidelines] to agencies \nthat requires them to use a \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d This requires \nadjudicators to carefully weigh a number of variables in an individual\u2019s life \nto determine whether that individual\u2019s behavior raises a security concern, if \nat all, and whether that concern has been mitigated such that the individual \nmay now receive a favorable adjudicative determination. Relevant \nmitigations include, but are not limited to, frequency of use and whether the \nindividual can demonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur, including by \nsigning an attestation or other such appropriate mitigation. Additionally, in \nlight of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting illegal drug use \nwhile occupying a sensitive position or holding a security clearance, \nagencies are encouraged to advise prospective national security workforce \nemployees that they should refrain from any future marijuana use upon \ninitiation of the national security vetting process, which commences once \nthe individual signs the certification contained in the Standard Form 86 (SF-\n86), Questionnaire for National Security Positions. \nSecurity Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies \nConducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified \nInformation or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (Dec. 21, 2021) at 2 (quoted in ISCR \nCase No. 20-02974 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2022)). \nApplicant frequently possessed and used marijuana the last two or three years up \nto about three weeks before his hearing. He used cocaine 10 times. He knew his \nmarijuana and cocaine possession or use or both was prohibited by federal law. Prior to \nhis hearing, he said he intended to use marijuana in the future until or unless he was \ngranted a security clearance. His decisions to repeatedly possess and use marijuana and \ncocaine are an indication he lacks the qualities expected of those with access to national \nsecrets. \nApplicant provided some important mitigating information. He voluntarily disclosed \nhis marijuana and cocaine use on his SCA, during his OPM interview, in his SOR \nresponse, and during his hearing. At his hearing, he said he ended his marijuana use \nthree weeks before the hearing, and he did not intend to use marijuana or cocaine in the \nfuture. He instructed his friends not to give him illegal drugs or drug paraphernalia even if \nhe asks for them. \nI am not convinced Applicant\u2019s marijuana and cocaine possession and use\n\u201chappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur [and] does not cast doubt \n \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \non [his] current reliability, trustworthiness, [and] good judgment.\u201d He may use marijuana \nand cocaine in the future. More time without illegal drug use is necessary to mitigate \nGuideline H security concerns. \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16 provides personal conduct disqualifying conditions that are relevant in this \ncase. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c), and 16(e)(1) read: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's personal, \nprofessional, or community standing . . . . \nSOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges the information in SOR \u00b6 1 and its subparagraphs, supra. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is sufficient for an adverse determination, and AG \u00b6 16(c) is not implicated by \nSOR \u00b6 2.a. \nApplicant repeatedly disclosed the information in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.b, and 2.c to \nsecurity officials, and he is in not vulnerable to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. He \nis not embarrassed or ashamed about his involvement with illegal drugs. AG \u00b6 16(e)(1) is \nnot established. \nApplicant said he used inhalants of either amyl nitrate or isobutyl nitrate until \naround September 2023, which was about four weeks before his hearing. He used an \ninhalant about once a week. He acknowledged that his use of the inhalant was illegal \nunder the state law where he resides. AG \u00b6 16(c) is established for SOR \u00b6 2.b. \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 includes conditions which could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;  \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was caused \nor significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a person with \nprofessional responsibilities for advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning security processes. Upon being made aware of the \nrequirement to cooperate or provide the information, the individual \ncooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur;  \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply to Applicant\u2019s illegal use of inhalants. I have \nlingering concerns that his lapses in judgment are likely to recur and continue to cast \ndoubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. More time without illegal use \nof inhalants is necessary to mitigate personal conduct security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guidelines H and \nE are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant disclosed his history of involvement with marijuana, cocaine, and \ninhalants on his SCA, during his OPM interview, in his SOR response, and at his hearing. \nHis involvement with illegal drugs was not discovered through law enforcement \ninvestigation or security interviews of witnesses. He did not test positive on a urinalysis \ntest. \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is more persuasive at this time. \nApplicant used cocaine about 10 times, marijuana numerous times, and inhalants \nnumerous times. He received clear notice in the SOR that use of marijuana and inhalants \nwas incompatible with holding a security clearance. He used marijuana and illegal \ninhalants up to about three weeks before his hearing. He stated that he did not intend to \nuse marijuana and inhalants in the future. \nAn honest and candid self-report of illegal drug use is an important indication that, \nif granted security clearance eligibility, the individual would disclose any threats to \nnational security, even if the disclosure involves an issue that might damage his or her \nown career or personal reputation. Applicant was candid and honest about his history of \nmarijuana, cocaine, and inhalants possessions and uses. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person. Applicant failed to mitigate drug involvement and substance \nmisuse and personal conduct security concerns. \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to be eligible for a \nsecurity clearance. The determination of an individual\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance is not a once in a lifetime occurrence, but is based on applying the \nfactors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to the evidence presented. Under his current \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \ncircumstances, a clearance is not warranted.

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 14, 2023, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines D and J. \nApplicant responded to the SOR on October 4, 2023, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on May 3, 2024. The hearing \nwas convened as scheduled on September 24, 2024. The Government offered five \nexhibits, which were marked as Government Exhibits 1-5 and admitted without \nobjection. Applicant testified but offered no exhibits.

It alleged Applicant was convicted of three \ncounts of Felony Second Degree Sexual Exploitation of a Minor, when he was actually \nconvicted on two counts of Felony Second Degree Sexual Exploitation of a Minor. (Tr. \n8-9) There being no objection, SOR \u00b6 2.a is amended to read as follows: \nOn about February 23, 2023, in [County, State] you were convicted of two \ncounts of Felony Second Degree Exploitation of a Minor. You received a \nsuspended sentence and placed on probation through February 2027.

In 2016 at age 21, he began to view child \npornography online. He was still attracted to adult pornography, but child pornography \nbecame another version of his addiction to pornography. (Tr. 19-22; GE 2) \nBetween 2016 to 2020, Applicant viewed child pornography once a day for about \none to two hours a day. When he moved in with his wife, his access was reduced to \nabout 30 minutes to one hour a day when he had time alone. His wife was unaware of \nhis pornography use. He used a social media site to access pornography. The social \nmedia site contained groups that were interested in a particular topic. He would join a \ngroup and view pornographic material that was posted there, to include child \npornography. Some of the groups consisted of 50 individuals. He accessed the social \nmedia site via his cell phone. He did not use his home or work computers.

He usually sought videos of girls who were around eight years old or older. \nHe admits he would become sexually aroused while viewing these images. He never \nfantasizes about having sex with underage children. He does not consider himself to be \na pedophile. He understands having sex with children is illegal and damaging to the \nchild. He understands viewing, downloading, and possessing child pornography is \nillegal. He is aware that children in the videos he watched were being forced to perform \nagainst their will. He understands his actions contributed to child sex trafficking. He said \nhe had an addiction which he could not stop. He tried quitting multiple times, but it \nconsumed him. (Tr. 24-28) \nApplicant believes that the social media site reported him to law enforcement, \nbecause he began transferring videos containing child pornography from one group to \nanother on the site in December 2021. He had been transferring videos once or twice a \nweek to other groups for at least six months before he was arrested on July 26, 2022. \nHe claims he stopped viewing child pornography completely on the day of his arrest. He \nwas banned by the social media site on the date of his arrest. The local sheriff\u2019s office \narrested him and he was originally charged with five counts of Felony Second Degree \nSexual Exploitation of Minors. (Tr. 34-35; GE 2; GE 3; GE 4) \nOn February 27, 2023, he was convicted on two counts of Felony Second \nDegree Sexual Exploitation of Minors. He was sentenced to between 25 and 90 months \nof confinement, which was suspended. He is on monitored probation until February \n2027. He paid fines and court costs of $1,385.50.  He is required to register as a sex \noffender for 30 years. As a condition of his probation, he was to participate in therapy or \nevaluations as recommended; he was not to communicate nor be on the premises of \nany victim in this case; he was not to reside in the household with any minor children; \nand he was not to be employed in any capacity in which he has access to minors under \n18 years old without disclosing the contents of this judgment. (Tr. 37; GE 4 at 7) \nApplicant does not live with his wife and child. He lives with his parents and his \nwife and child live in the house that they bought a few months ago. He admits to viewing \nadult pornography for five months after he was convicted. He began to view adult \npornography again because he found it stressful being separated from his wife and son. \nHe moved out of the house on the day he was convicted. He fully admitted to his wife \nand probation officer that he was viewing adult pornography. He has not viewed adult \npornography since August 2023. His laptop and phone are being monitored by the \nprobation office. (Tr. 37-43) \nApplicant and his wife currently attend counseling with a married couple, Dr. R.F. \nand Dr. S.F. They began attending counseling in October 2022. They attend counseling \nabout once a week. Both Dr. R.F. and Dr. S.F. are certified biblical counselors. They \nhave a theological background. In an unsigned letter, dated September 4, 2023, Dr. \nR.F., indicated that he and his wife have helped over 2,000 families with similar and \nvaried problems. Applicant was referred to him for his pornography addiction. He has \nfaithfully been coming to counseling with his wife.

He believes Dr. R.F and Dr. S.F. came in on day one and gave him \nanswers. He said it is an absolute blessing to have a solution that finally works after \nover 20 years of struggling with his problem. He believes that a biblical-based view and \nsolution has worked. (Tr. 57-59) \nAbout two months before the hearing, Applicant starting to see another certified \nbiblical counselor, Mr. K, because issues came up with Dr. R.F. and Dr. S.F.\u2019s ability to \ncounsel. Applicant is not aware of the reason, but believes it is related to legal issues \nthat may prevent their ability to counsel. (Tr. 45-49, 58)  \nApplicant testified that Dr. R.F and Dr. S.F. taught him to focus on pure thoughts. \nThey taught him to focus on things that are holy, good, and honest. He has gone back \nto college to study for his bachelor\u2019s degree. He believes he will get off probation early \nbecause his separation from his family is causing more harm than good. His arrest was \nin the local news. His family, church members, and co-workers are aware of his \npornography addiction. Some know of the conviction and the reason for the arrest, but \nnot the specific details behind the arrest. He agrees that the details make him \nvulnerable to blackmail. (Tr. 49-55) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \n \nThe security concern for sexual behavior is set out in AG \u00b6 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted;  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual behavior \nthat the individual is unable to stop;  \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and  \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion \nor judgment.  \nApplicant\u2019s pornography addiction, to include child pornography raises all of the \ndisqualifying conditions under the Sexual Behavior concern. His viewing and \ndownloading of child pornography violated criminal law. He admits that his behavior was \ncompulsive and he was unable to stop. His viewing and downloading of child \npornography made him vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress. His viewing and \ndownloading of child pornography showed of lack of discretion or judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n13(a) \u2013 13(d) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate sexual behavior security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 14. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress;  \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet; and \n(e) the individual has successfully completed an appropriate program of \ntreatment, or is currently enrolled in one, has demonstrated ongoing and \nconsistent compliance with the treatment plan, and/or has received a \nfavorable prognosis from a qualified mental health professional indicating \nthe behavior is readily controllable with treatment.  \nApplicant first viewed adult pornography between the ages of eight and ten. He \nwas an adult when he first viewed child pornography in 2016 at age 21. He viewed child \npornography on a regular basis between 2016 until he was arrested in July 2022. He \nwas an adult during this entire period. AG \u00b6 14(a) does not apply. \nApplicant viewed child pornography on a regular basis for several years. He \ntestified that his viewing of child pornography was compulsive and he was unable to \nstop. He did not stop downloading/viewing child pornography until he was arrested in \nJuly 2022. I cannot conclude that his viewing of child pornography is unlikely to recur. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nHis conduct was illegal and immoral and continues to raise doubts about his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6 14(b) does not apply. His past conduct also makes \nhim vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress. AG \u00b6 14(c) does not apply. \nAG \u00b6 14(d) does not apply to the facts of this case. One cannot conclude the \nminor children involved in the pornographic films consented to what was being done to \nthem. Applicant viewed these videos on a public internet site. He would share videos \nwith other members of a group which at a maximum consisted of up to 50 members. \nAG \u00b6 14(e) does not apply. While Applicant is attending biblical counseling with \nDr. R.F and Dr. S.F., they are not \u201cqualified mental health professionals.\u201d It is unclear \nwhether Applicant\u2019s behavior is readily controllable with treatment. He did not provide \nan evaluation from a \u201cqualified mental health professional\u201d who is an expert in the area \nof child pornography addiction. \nSexual Behavior security concerns are not mitigated. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; \nand \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation. \nIn February 2023, Applicant was convicted of two counts of Felony Second \nDegree Sexual Exploitation of a Minor. He received a suspended sentence but was \nplaced on probation until February 2027. He was also required to register as a sex \noffender for 30 years. AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(b) and 31(c) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and  \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nNeither mitigating condition applies. Applicant viewed child pornography on \nregular basis between 2016 and July 2022 when he was arrested. He admits that his \nconduct was compulsive. His conduct raises doubts about his reliability, trustworthiness, \nand judgment. Given his lengthy history of viewing child pornography, I cannot conclude \nthat it is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 32(a) does not apply. I cannot conclude there is \nevidence of successful rehabilitation. Applicant remains on probation until February \n2027. It is too soon to conclude that he is fully rehabilitated. AG \u00b6 32(d) does not apply. \nThe Criminal Conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines D and J in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the security concerns under Guidelines D and J. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

Five of the six debts \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e) have been reduced to judgments reflected in court records. All the \njudgments were default judgments. None have been satisfied. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.e allege judgments for delinquent credit-card accounts \nfrom the same bank. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b allege judgments for $1,718 and $2,049, both \nentered on October 29, 2021. SOR \u00b6 1.c alleges a judgment for $2,627, entered in April \n2023. SOR \u00b6 1.d is a judgment for $9,994, entered in March 2020, arising from the \ndeficiency after Applicant\u2019s automobile was repossessed. He testified that he made a few \ntelephone calls about recovering the vehicle, but he stopped trying after he \u201ckind of got \nthe runaround.\u201d (Tr. 28) All the debts became delinquent after Applicant and a former \ncohabitant broke up after ten years, reducing the family income by half. Before the \nbreakup, Applicant counted on his cohabitant to manage the household finances. (Tr. 19-\n20) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges a medical bill placed for collection of $400.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.

Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are recent, numerous, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established for the unresolved judgments alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-\n1.e. Applicant\u2019s domestic breakup was a condition largely beyond his control that reduced \nhis family income by half. However, he has not acted responsibly. He has taken no action \nto resolve any of the judgments. He has acted responsibly regarding the medical bill \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f, which he has paid in full. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. Applicant submitted no evidence of financial \ncounseling. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e. It is \nestablished for the medical bill alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f, which is resolved. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant has not disputed any of the debts alleged \nin the SOR. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances.

After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by \nhis delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

He answered, \nadmitted all SOR allegations, and attached three supporting documents that are identified \nas follows (Item 2): \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit A (AE A) \u2013 State DUI and Substance Abuse \nProgram Certificate of Completion dated August 19, 2022 (noting \n\u201cCounseling/Treatment was not required at Evaluation\u201d); \nAE B \u2013 Basic Driver Improvement Course Certificate of Completion \ndated February 2, 2023; and \nAE C \u2013 Impact Panel Certificate of Completion dated July 11, 2022. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese exhibits being part of Applicant\u2019s Answer, they are already part of the \nrecord. \nThe salient portions of Applicant\u2019s August 17, 2023 Response are summarized \nbelow: \nOn June 18, 2022, I was unfortunately charged with a DUI offense. \nWhile I deeply regret this lapse in judgment, I took full responsibility for my \ntime of my situation by entering a plea. At the time of arrest, I decided not \nto partake in the breath test. Years ago, in a conversation with a trusted \nfriend of mine, who is in local law enforcement, advised me to never do the \nBreathalyzer. He advised if I were ever to get arrested to decline the \nbreathalyzer and all field sobriety test [sic]. I took that information to heart \nand remembered it at the time of my arrest. Declining these tests may not \nhave been the right decision, looking back at my situation, but it was the \ndecision made with the information I had at the time. I want to assure all \ninvolved that this is an isolated incident and is not a reflection of my \ncharacter, values, or commitment to my responsibilities. I acknowledge my \nsituation and charge of reckless driving with alcohol. It was not my intention \nto mischaracterize or mislead about my charge. Throughout the process, \nmy case was referred in the short phrase of reckless driving. At no time do \nI downplay my case, I take responsibility for my actions while \nacknowledging the seriousness of the offense. \n[In this paragraph, Applicant summarizes the steps he has taken to \nsatisfy successfully the terms of his sentence during the seven months \nsince his arrest. He attached documents that will be marked and identified \nbelow as additional Applicant exhibits.]    \n[In this paragraph, Applicant recounts the steps he has taken since \nhis arrest not required by his sentence to become more health-conscious \nand adopt a more healthy life-style.]  \nIn his penultimate paragraph, Applicant states: \nI understand that holding a security clearance requires the highest \nlevel of trust, integrity, and responsibility. I am fully aware of the potential \nimplications of my actions and am determined to prove that I can meet and \nexceed these expectations. My professional record, including . . . employee \nof the month, and monthly distinction performance status, demonstrates my \ncommitment to excellence and my ability to contribute positively and \nendeavor [sic].  \nAttached to Applicant\u2019s Response was a multi-page document that I have marked \nas AE D identified as: County Court payment receipt dated August 14, 2023, showing \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cEarly Termination Is Being Proceeded.

The highlights are summarized below: \nApplicant was driving home from a friend\u2019s house, after having one \nbeer. The police pulled him over for a missing license plate light. He was \nasked to complete an in-field breathalyzer test due to the smell of alcohol, \nwhich he declined. He was transported to the sheriff\u2019s office and held for 12 \nhours. He was released on his own recognizance. He has not received a \ncourt date but was told that he would be appearing due to the charge of a \nDUI. He believes that the charge for DUI is a misdemeanor. He has not \nbeen given any charge information. He has not been to court yet. This has \nonly happened once. (Item 5.)   \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has noted, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).  \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare flexible rules of law, apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision.  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set forth in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes the following condition that could raise security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 22. The following disqualifying condition is applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence . . . , regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with an alcohol use \ndisorder. \nAG \u00b6 23 also notes the following condition that could mitigate the security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 22: \n(c) the individual is participating in a counseling . . . program, has no \nprevious history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer, his PSI, and Government Exhibit 4 establish \nthe applicability of AG \u00b6 22(a). The next question is whether mitigating condition AG \u00b6 \n23(c) applies. \nSince his arrest and throughout the clearance investigation process, Applicant has \nbeen fully candid about the circumstances of his arrest. He was pulled over for a minor \nauto light infraction. Due to the smell of alcohol in the vehicle, he was cited for DUI. Since \nhe declined in-field sobriety tests, he was taken to the sheriff\u2019s office, then released on \nhis own recognizance. During his PSI, he twice referred to his arrest as being for DUI, \neven though at that time he had not yet been to court or seen the charges. He was not \nequivocal at all on that point. He also confirmed that this was his first such offense. \nApplicant\u2019s exhibits tracked his success accomplishing his sentence requirements. \nThose included a DUI Program, an evaluation that concluded treatment was not needed, \nand a Basic Driver Improvement Course. As a result of that progress, he was deemed \neligible for an early termination of his one-year probation. On August 29, 2023, the Court \nordered an early termination of his probation.

By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 31. \nThe disqualifying condition potentially applicable in this case is: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless \nof whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or \nconvicted. \nApplicant admitted to his June 2022 arrest for DUI. Therefore, the above \ndisqualifying condition applies. \nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \ncondition is applicable: \n(c) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited to \nthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nThe analysis under Guideline G applies fully to AG \u00b6 32(c). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) \n(explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). In my analysis above, I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in \nlight of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant leaves me with no questions about his eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. Therefore, I conclude that Applicant has provided sufficient evidence \nto mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline G, alcohol consumption, and \nGuideline J, criminal conduct. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nFor Applicant \n Conclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant access to classified information.

He received the FORM on October 17, 2023, and did not respond. The case \nwas assigned to me on January 31, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations in the SOR. His \nadmissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 24-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He received a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in May 2022.

He has never \nheld a security clearance. \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has used marijuana multiple times a week from \nJune 2018 through at least May 2023 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and that he intends to use it in the \nfuture (SOR \u00b6 1.b). In his SCA, he stated that he has used marijuana since June 2018 to \nhelp him sleep. He also stated that he intends to continue using it because he has been \ndiagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and has a medical marijuana card. \n(FORM Item 2 at 29-30) During an interview with a security investigator in February 2023, \nand in response to DOHA interrogatories in June 2023, he stated that he uses marijuana \nmultiple times a week as needed, that he suffers from PTSD, and that he intends to \ncontinue using it until a doctor can determine another suitable treatment for PTSD. \n(FORM Item 3 at 2-3, 6) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Egan at 531. \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d \nis \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area \nTransit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a nexus or \nrational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and \nan applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan at 531. \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions establish the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition); \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia; and \nAG \u00b6 25(g): expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nNeither of the above mitigating conditions are established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline H and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his drug involvement. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1 (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted one of the SOR allegations (\u00b6 1.a), But denied the remaining allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.f). His admission is adopted as a finding of fact. After a careful review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 31 years old. He is being sponsored for a clearance by a defense contractor. He obtained a Class A commercial driver\u2019s license (CDL) in 2013. He has been employed outside the defense industry as an order packer and shipper from 2015 to present. He is engaged to be married and has one child. He has never held a security clearance. (Items 3-4, 8) The SOR alleged Applicant owed six delinquent accounts (a residual car loan after repossession and five student loans in collection status) totaling approximately $26,195. (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f) In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted owing the car loan, but he denied the student loans stating that they were \u201call current and up to date.\u201d The debts are supported by listings as delinquent debts in credit reports from July 2022 and January 2023. (Items 5-6; SOR answer) The status of the SOR debts is as follows: SOR \u00b6 1.a-$12.152. This is an automobile loan for a repossessed car.

Applicant was given an opportunity to file objections \nand submit material in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not submit \nany response. The case was assigned to me on February 6, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted one of the SOR allegations (\u00b6 1.a), But denied the remaining \nallegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.f). His admission is adopted as a finding of fact. After a careful \nreview of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 31 years old. He is being sponsored for a clearance by a defense \ncontractor. He obtained a Class A commercial driver\u2019s license (CDL) in 2013. He has \nbeen employed outside the defense industry as an order packer and shipper from 2015 \nto present. He is engaged to be married and has one child. He has never held a security \nclearance. (Items 3-4, 8) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant owed six delinquent accounts (a residual car loan \nafter repossession and five student loans in collection status) totaling approximately \n$26,195. (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f) In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted owing the car loan, but he \ndenied the student loans stating that they were \u201call current and up to date.\u201d The debts \nare supported by listings as delinquent debts in credit reports from July 2022 and \nJanuary 2023. (Items 5-6; SOR answer) \nThe status of the SOR debts is as follows: \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a-$12.152. This is an automobile loan for a repossessed car. Applicant \ncosigned for this truck for his former girlfriend. The relationship ended and the former \ngirlfriend stopped making payments and he was unable to afford the payments as well. \nHe voluntarily turned the truck back into the dealership. The last payment made on the \naccount was in January 2021 and the debt was charged off by the creditor. In his \nanswer, he indicated that he would be calling the creditor to set up payments. He failed \nto provide any documentation showing he had taken such action. This debt is \nunresolved. (Items 2, 5-8) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-$4,337; 1.c-$3,536; 1.d-$2,403; 1.e-$2,365; 1.f-$1,402. These are\nfive student loans that were placed in collection with an activity date of October 2016. \nApplicant stated during his background interview that these student loans went into \ncollections and his wages were garnished to repay them sometime in 2019. He claimed \nthat he then called the creditor and was placed into a rehabilitation program requiring \nhim to make regular payments for five to eight months. If he made the required \npayments over that time, his loans would be considered current. He further claims that \nhe began making the required monthly payments but they ceased because of the \nCARES Act relief during the pandemic.

His September 2023 credit report shows that all five student loans are \nin a \u201cPays account as agreed\u201d status and shows the last payment made on the \naccounts was in August 2023. The monthly payment amount for these student loans is \nnot listed on this credit report or anywhere else in the record. (Items 3-8) \nApplicant\u2019s financial worksheet that he completed in January 2023 reflects a net \nmonthly income of $2,520 and total monthly expenses of $2,062, leaving a monthly \nremainder of $457. This budget does not account for any student loan payments. There \nis no evidence of financial counseling. (Item 4, p.8) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concerns for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial difficulties dating back to 2016 when his \nstudent loans were put into collection status. He also failed to pay a truck loan after it \nwas repossessed. He incurred six delinquent debts totaling approximately $26,000. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and credit reports establish the debts. I find both disqualifying \nconditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent and remain unresolved. He did not provide sufficient \nevidence to show that his financial problems are unlikely to recur. To the contrary, his \nbudget shows that he only has a $400 monthly residual after paying all his expenses \nand his student loan payment is not accounted for in that budget. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not \napply. He did not describe any circumstances beyond his control that led to his poor \nfinancial condition. His agreeing to cosign on a truck for an ex-girlfriend was not such a \ncondition. AG \u00b6 20(b) does apply. \nApplicant failed to document any efforts he made to resolve or pay his delinquent \ndebts. Although it appears he made payments on his five student loans in August 2023, \nas shown by his recent credit report, there is insufficient evidence to show that those \npayments are sustainable, given his overall financial condition and his history of letting \nthose student loans go into collection status. There is no evidence of financial \ncounseling and no evidence that his financial conditions are under control. He has not \nshown a good-faith effort to address his debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) do not \napply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has not established a track \nrecord of financial responsibility. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations with explanations. His admissions are incorporated into my findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 39 years old. He is married and has two children. He completed a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2014 with a focus in business administration. He has worked for his current employer since February 2018 and is a manager of engineering operations. He does not hold a security clearance. (GX 1; Tr. 20-21) In about November 2016, Applicant traveled to the location of another U.S. Government Agency (OGA) to undergo a polygraph interview for a security clearance. During the interview, he realized that he had a firearm in his vehicle which was in violation of federal law. He informed the investigators and was escorted by security to his vehicle where he surrendered the firearm. He was subsequently charged with a firearms offense. (GX 1-2, GX 4; Tr. 75-77) Applicant stated that he maintained a \u201cconcealed carry\u201d permit and forgot that he had the firearm in his vehicle when he drove onto Government property. Following the completion of 20 hours of community service, the charges were dismissed. Applicant stated that, since the arrest, he allowed his \u201cconcealed carry\u201d permit to expire and he no longer carries a firearm in his vehicle.

Or.) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the Security Executive Agent Directive 4 \n(SEAD 4), National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 8, 2023, and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). The \ncase was assigned to me on November 6, 2023. On January 29, 2024, DOHA issued a \nnotice scheduling the hearing for February 22, 2024. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel offered into evidence \nGovernment Exhibits (GX) 1-4. Applicant testified and offered into evidence Applicant \nExhibits (AX) A-O. All exhibits were admitted without objection. Two witnesses also \ntestified and provided character evidence on behalf of Applicant. I held the record open \nthrough March 8, 2024, to allow both parties the opportunity to submit additional \ndocuments. Applicant submitted an additional exhibit, AX P, which was admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on February 29, 2024. The record \nclosed on March 8, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the allegations with \nexplanations. His admissions are incorporated into my findings of fact. After a thorough \nand careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 39 years old. He is married and has two children. He completed a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2014 with a focus in business administration. He has worked for his \ncurrent employer since February 2018 and is a manager of engineering operations. He \ndoes not hold a security clearance. (GX 1; Tr. 20-21) \nIn about November 2016, Applicant traveled to the location of another U.S. \nGovernment Agency (OGA) to undergo a polygraph interview for a security clearance. \nDuring the interview, he realized that he had a firearm in his vehicle which was in violation \nof federal law. He informed the investigators and was escorted by security to his vehicle \nwhere he surrendered the firearm. He was subsequently charged with a firearms offense. \n(GX 1-2, GX 4; Tr. 75-77) \nApplicant stated that he maintained a \u201cconcealed carry\u201d permit and forgot that he \nhad the firearm in his vehicle when he drove onto Government property. Following the \ncompletion of 20 hours of community service, the charges were dismissed. Applicant \nstated that, since the arrest, he allowed his \u201cconcealed carry\u201d permit to expire and he no \nlonger carries a firearm in his vehicle. (GX 4; Tr. 75-77) \nIn March 2017 and again in October 2018, Applicant was denied a security \nclearance by the OGA. As part of those OGA investigations, he participated in multiple \npolygraph interviews and disclosed a history of activities that serve as the basis for the \nGovernment\u2019s current security concerns. In August 2020, he submitted an SCA to DOD \nand listed that he had been denied a security clearance by the OGA for concerns over \n\u201cpersonal conduct and use of information systems.\u201d He also detailed that, as a systems \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nadministrator, he had previously \u201caccess[ed] employee records without explicit \nauthorization.\u201d (GX 1-2; Tr. 100-105, 118-120) \nWhile the DOD investigation was ongoing, Applicant submitted another application \nfor access to classified information to the OGA, which was denied in September 2022. \nThis OGA application and initial denial are not part of the record evidence. He appealed \nthe OGA decision. In February 2023, he received a letter from an OGA senior appeals \nofficer affirming the denial. This letter is part of the record evidence as GX 2. It provides \na summary of Applicant\u2019s past conduct that resulted in OGA\u2019s denial of his application. \nThis conduct was also alleged in the SOR. (GX 2; Tr. 74-82) \nThe OGA denial letter summarized several concerns, including that, over an \nunspecified period of time, Applicant had illegally downloaded movies, songs, games, and \nbooks with an estimated value of $23,000. In his June 2023 response to DOD \ninterrogatories, Applicant admitted that he illegally downloaded media and software \nthrough about 2011. He testified that he knew that the illegal downloading was wrong and \nhe stopped because he did not want it to interfere with his ability to obtain work in cyber-\nrelated security. (GX 2, GX 4; Tr. 110-113) \nThe OGA denial letter further stated that Applicant disclosed that he had a \npornography addiction and had previously streamed pornographic images on his work \ncomputer. In his June 2023 interrogatory response, Applicant stated he only recalled \nlooking at pornography while working for a company in 2003 when he was still in high \nschool. (GX 2, GX 4) \nHowever, in his Answer and in his testimony, Applicant stated that he also viewed \npornography from a work computer while with Employer A, but could not recall the \nfrequency of his viewing. He worked with Employer A from about August 2008 through \nOctober 2011 and described the company as a small healthcare management practice \nrun by just one other person. (Answer; Tr. 86-95, 115-116) \nThe OGA denial letter also stated that, between 2008 and 2011, Applicant \n\u201caccessed patients\u2019 personal and medical files out of boredom and curiosity, to include \nmedical information on a patient who [he] knew\u201d and that he continued to access medical \nand personal files between 2011 and 2013. (GX 2) (SOR \u00b6 2.b) Applicant explained that, \nas part of this job, he would go into medical practices and assist them in transitioning from \npaper to electronic medical records. He testified only remembering one occasion, in 2009, \nthat he viewed patient medical records. At the time, while tasked to learn about the \nmedical records management system one of his clients was utilizing, he recognized a \npatient\u2019s name on his client\u2019s appointments calendar. The patient was one of Applicant\u2019s \nformer high school classmates. He opened and viewed the patient\u2019s medical records as \nwell as the purpose for the upcoming visit. He testified that he knew at the time that the \ninformation was protected, but he did not give his actions any significant thought. He \nclaimed he did not further disseminate the information and that Employer A never knew \nof his actions.

In \nthat position, he built websites and marketing material for clients and claimed not to have \naccess to medical records or personal identifying information (PII). (Answer; GX 2, GX 4; \nTr. 104-108) \nApplicant began working with Employer C in about October 2014. The OGA denial \nletter stated that, while employed as a system administrator with Employer C from 2015 \nthrough 2016, Applicant accessed human resource files to view the addresses of about \n70 employees to \u201csee what houses the employees could afford.\u201d (GX 2) Applicant later \naccessed a document \u201ccontaining manager and supervisor salaries, bonuses, and social \nsecurity numbers.\u201d (GX 2-4; Tr. 85-90) (SOR \u00b6 2.a) \nIn his SCA, Applicant stated that, while working with Employer C, he \u201caccessed \nemployee records without explicit authorization\u201d and \u201cabused\u201d the trust of the company \nhe was working for at the time. (GX 1) He detailed that, as a system administrator, he \nwas responsible for \u201cmanaging the communications systems, networks and server \ninfrastructure\u201d for his company. (GX 3) On multiple occasions in that position, he \naccessed a human resources spreadsheet that contained PII for everyone in the \ncompany. This included employee birthdates, salaries, spousal names and mailing \naddresses. He stated he accessed the files because he was \u201ccurious about where [his] \ncoworkers lived, what their salaries were and how much their houses cost.\u201d (GX 3) He \nclaimed he last viewed those records in early 2016 and did not disseminate the \ninformation. (Answer; GX 1, GX 3; Tr. 110-120) \nApplicant further stated that, at the time of the incident, he did not consider \nreporting it to Employer C as he \u201cdid not perceive it as an issue.\u201d (GX 3) With regard to \nboth Employer A and Employer C, he stated he recognized that he worked in a \u201cposition \nof trust\u201d but claimed that he had \u201cno formal training and guidance on how to handle \nsensitive information and or PII.\u201d (Answer) He stated he was \u201cyoung, inexperienced, and \ndid not know any better\u201d at the time. (Answer; Tr. 102-115) \nApplicant left Employer C for Employer D, his current employer, in about February \n2018. He claimed since \u201csurrounding myself with information privacy and security focused \nindividuals, I now realize how wrong I was in accessing that information without direct and \nexplicit consent.\u201d (GX 3) He claimed while with Employer D, he received proper training \non how to handle sensitive information and \u201cfinally had clearly defined rules to abide by.\u201d \n(Answer) He is now considered a \u201crespected leader\u201d with Employer D and is \u201ctasked with \nenforcing and implementing new policy, controlling and managing access to enclaves and \nsensitive systems, and educating [Employer D\u2019s] workforce.\u201d (Answer) He stated his \nintent to not repeat his past mistakes.

The \ntherapist submitted a letter stating Applicant had discussed the past clearance incidents \nand had been \u201caccountable and acknowledged that [his] behavior was not only \ninappropriate but also a detriment to his character at the time.\u201d (AX H) She further noted \nthat Applicant had shown \u201cpersonal and professional growth\u201d over time. (AX H) Similarly, \nApplicant was seeing a performance psychology coach sponsored by Employer D. This \nperformance coach stated Applicant had undergone \u201cself-reflection\u201d over his past actions \nand was working to be a better leader in the workplace. (Answer; AX G-H; Tr. 24-28, \n84-85) \nTwo witnesses testified on Applicant\u2019s behalf at his hearing. Mr. H is a vice \npresident with Employer D and currently holds a security clearance. He has known \nApplicant for nearly four years and is his direct supervisor. Mr. H testified that Applicant \nhad not experienced any security incidents while with Employer D and was highly \nprotective of company policies and procedures. Mr. H also testified that Applicant was \ncommitted to maintaining the security environment of the workplace and was a trusted \nteam leader in the office. (AX C; Tr. 40-54) \nMr. P is the Chief Information Officer at Employer D, currently holds a security \nclearance and has also known Applicant for nearly four years. Mr. P testified that \nEmployer D focuses on various aspects of cyber security and is particularly attuned to \ncyber and insider threats. From that perspective, he testified that he was aware of \nApplicant\u2019s past transgressions but believed that Applicant had \u201cworked to rehabilitate his \ncharacter.\u201d Mr. P also stated that Applicant actively participates in security training and is \na highly valued member of the company. (AX A; Tr. 54-72) \nApplicant also submitted character reference letters, primarily from colleagues \nwithin Employer D. Several character references spoke to Applicant\u2019s maturation, \nparticularly since starting with Employer D in 2018 and his individual efforts to improve \nsecurity procedures on the job. They found Applicant to have shown \u201cexemplary \nprofessional conduct\u201d with a \u201ccomposed demeanor.\u201d (AX D-E) Annual performance \nreviews from the last three years reflect that he has performed at or above expectations \nand met all of his training requirements. (AX B, AX F, AX L, AX P) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d 484 \nU.S. 518, 531 (1988) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology \nThe security concern relating to this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 39: \nFailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the \nwillingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and \ninformation. Information Technology includes any computer-based, mobile, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nor wireless device used to create, store, access, process, manipulate, \nprotect, or move information. This includes any component, whether \nintegrated into a larger system or not, such as hardware, software, or \nfirmware, used to enable or facilitate these operations. \nThe adjudicative guideline notes several conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 40. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) unauthorized entry into any information technology system; and \n(e) unauthorized use of any information technology system. \nFrom about August 2008 through October 2011, while working with Employer A, \nApplicant accessed and reviewed patient medical records on multiple occasions and \nwithout authorization. He did not have access to PII while with Employer B from October \n2011 through October 2013. However, from about 2015 through early 2016, he accessed \nhuman resource files at Employer C without authorization. This information included \nsalaries, home addresses and social security numbers of employees and management. \nWhile with Employer A and Employer C, he breached the trust of his employers and the \nprivacy of several individuals. Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 40(a) and 40(e) apply. \nAG \u00b6 41 describes potentially applicable mitigating conditions for the misuse of \ninformation technology including: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened \nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nSeveral years have passed since Applicant accessed medical records and human \nresource records without authorization. Additionally, he has been working with \nEmployer D since 2018 and claims to have benefited from the higher security standards \nand training of that company. Therefore, AG \u00b6 41(a) has some application. \nNonetheless, Applicant breached the trust of his employers and the privacy of \nmany individuals on multiple occasions from 2008 through 2011 and again from 2015 \nthrough early 2016. These actions were entirely unrelated to the requirements of his \npositions. \nAt the time of his unauthorized viewing of Employer C\u2019s records, Applicant was a \nsystem administrator and was responsible for managing the communication systems, \nnetworks and server infrastructure for his company. Yet, at the time of the unauthorized \naccess, Applicant stated he did not perceive his actions to be an issue and claimed that \nhe did not have proper training on how to handle sensitive information. This apparent lack \nof training does not excuse his actions nor mitigate the security concerns. He was aware \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat his actions were wrong, but proceeded to commit a substantial breach of privacy \nanyway. \nApplicant also never disclosed his actions to either Employer A or Employer C. \nInstead, he first provided details of his actions only while undergoing an OGA \ninvestigation with polygraph examination. His lack of disclosure to either employer at the \ntime of the incidents undercuts mitigation and raises questions of judgment and \ntrustworthiness. \nAdditionally, Applicant illegally downloaded media and software and viewed \npornography on his work computer through 2011. This additional information was not \nalleged under Guideline M in the SOR, so it cannot be considered as disqualifying \nconduct. However, in weighing mitigation, it shows that Applicant\u2019s improper use of \ninformation technology was not an isolated event or occurred under unusual \ncircumstances. Instead, it demonstrates a pattern of rule violations. Applicant has not met \nhis burden of establishing mitigation under AG \u00b6 41(a). \nGuideline K, Handling Protected Information \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for handling protected information is \nset out in AG \u00b6 33: \nDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for \nhandling protected information-which includes classified and other sensitive \ngovernment information, and proprietary information-raises doubt about an \nindividual's trustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability \nto safeguard such information, and is a serious security concern. \nGuideline K security concerns are not limited to violations of DOD rules and \npolices, but also encompass violations of industry rules and policies established for the \nprotection of classified and sensitive information. See ISCR Case No. 15-08002 at 1 (App. \nBd. July 17, 2018); ISCR Case No. 14-00963 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 13, 2015). \nAG \u00b6 34 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I have considered all of them, and the following is potentially applicable: \n(d) inappropriate efforts to obtain or view protected information outside \none\u2019s need to know.  \nThe Guideline M security concerns are cross-alleged under Guideline K. \nApplicant\u2019s unauthorized access to patient medical records from 2009 through 2011 while \nwith Employer A, and his unauthorized access of human resource information, which was \nproprietary to Employer C, are sufficient to establish disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 34(d). \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 35 describes conditions that could mitigate the security concerns and are \npotentially applicable, including the following: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so \ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nSimilar to the reasoning under Guideline M, mitigation of the Guideline K security \nconcerns are not fully applicable under AG \u00b6 35(a). On multiple occasions during two \nseparate periods of time, Applicant breached the trust of employers and the privacy of \nseveral individuals by accessing medical records, social security numbers, salaries, and \nother proprietary and personal identifying information. \nParticularly as a system administrator for Employer C, Applicant was trusted to \nsafeguard information. Instead, he used his position to feed his personal curiosities. He \nnever informed either employer or any of the individuals of his actions, instead only \ndisclosing the information during a security investigation and polygraph examination. \nApplicant has not met his burden to establish that these events occurred under unusual \ncircumstances or no longer cast doubt as to his reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility.  \nUnder Guideline E, the Government alleges that Applicant was denied a clearance \nby an OGA in March 2017 and October 2018 for reasons including personal conduct \nissues, misuse of information systems and a firearms offense. The OGA security \nclearance decision is informative, but not binding in DOHA proceedings. However, the \nunderlying conduct alleged remains relevant to this assessment of Applicant\u2019s security \nworthiness. \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for personal conduct under AG \u00b6 16 \nand the following is potentially applicable: \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: (1) untrustworthy or \nunreliable behavior to include breach of client confidentiality, release of \nproprietary information, unauthorized release of sensitive corporate or \ngovernment protected information; (2) any disruptive, violent, or other \ninappropriate behavior; (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and (4) \nevidence of significant misuse of Government or other employer's time or \nresources. \nApplicant\u2019s unauthorized access of medical and human resource files while \nworking with two separate employers, along with his firearms offense in 2016 are \nsufficient whole-person concerns for AG \u00b6 16(d) to be applicable. The general security \nconcern under AG \u00b6 15 also applies. \nConditions that could mitigate the personal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 17 and the following are potentially applicable: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nApplicant\u2019s carrying of a firearm in his vehicle onto Government property was \ninadvertent and regrettable. However, he disclosed his error on the day that it occurred \nand accepted the consequences of his actions. He has since made changes by removing \nthe firearm from the vehicle so that the event would not be repeated. This component of \nthe SOR allegation is mitigated by AG \u00b6 17(c). \nStill, Applicant\u2019s repeated, unauthorized access of medical records and human \nresource files at Employer A and Employer C were not minor offenses and neither event \noccurred under unique circumstances. When considered with his history of illegally \ndownloading media and software as well as his prior viewing of pornographic material on \na work computer, his actions reflect a history of non-compliance with basic rules and \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nregulations and raise questions regarding his reliability, trustworthiness and judgment. \nGiven the seriousness of his actions, Applicant has not met his burden to establish \nmitigation under either AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) or 17(d). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline M, Guideline K, and Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. \nOn multiple occasions during two separate periods of time, Applicant breached the \ntrust of his employers and the privacy of several individuals by viewing medical and \nhuman resource documents. He never informed the employers or the individuals of his \nactions. He also previously viewed pornography on a work computer and participated in \nthe extensive illegal download of media and software. He now claims that he has matured \nand received training to be more cognizant of his obligations for the protection of \ninformation. However, given the seriousness of his conduct, particularly while he was \nemployed as a system administrator, I find that Applicant has not met his burden of \npersuasion. \nThe record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \nsuitability for a security clearance. I conclude that he failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline M: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline K: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nsensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of\nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances\nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner\ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may\nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises\nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as\ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in\nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nMarijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance under Federal law pursuant to Title \n21, Section 812 of the United States Code. Schedule I drugs are those which have a high \npotential for abuse; have no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United \nStates; and lack accepted safety for use of the drug under medical supervision. Section \n844 under Title 21 of the United States Code makes it unlawful for any person to \nknowingly or intentionally possess a controlled substance not obtained pursuant to a valid \nprescription. \nOn October 25, 2014, the then Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued \nguidance that changes to laws by some states and the District of Columbia to legalize or \ndecriminalize the recreational use of marijuana do not alter existing federal law or the \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines, and that an individual\u2019s disregard of federal \nlaw pertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively \nrelevant in national security eligibility determinations. \nMoreover, on December 21, 2021, the current DNI issued clarifying guidance \nconcerning marijuana, noting that prior recreational use of marijuana by an individual may \nbe relevant to security adjudications, but is not determinative in the whole-person \nevaluation. Relevant factors in mitigation include the frequency of use and whether the \nindividual can demonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana from August 2018 until at least December 2022 \nviolated Federal drug laws. He has expressed his intent to continue to use marijuana. AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(g) apply. The SOR did not allege Applicant\u2019s illegal possession or \npurchase of marijuana. Therefore, AG \u00b6 25(c) does not apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the drug involvement security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 26. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant bears the burden of production and persuasion in mitigation. The DOHA \nAppeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability \nof mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \n[Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)], supra. \u201cAny \ndoubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, \nEnclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). (ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2013)) \nApplicant obtained a state-issued medical marijuana card and used marijuana for \npain management following a motorcycle injury. While his marijuana use may comply with \nstate drug laws, it violates Federal drug laws and DOD policies for contractors and \nclearance holders. There is no waiver or exception for medicinal marijuana use. During \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhis December 2022 OPM interview, Applicant stated that he was unaware that his \nmedicinal marijuana use violated Federal drug laws. His ignorance or uncertainty about \nwhether marijuana was prohibited under Federal law does not excuse his conduct. See \nISCR Case No. 19-00540 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2019)(citing Rhode Island v. \nMassachusetts, 45 U.S. 591, 613 (1846)). More importantly, even after he was made \naware of the Federal drug laws, he has chosen to continue his marijuana use in knowing \nviolation of those laws. He has not expressed any intent to discontinue his marijuana use \ngoing forward. Applicant has not mitigated the drug involvement and substance misuse \nsecurity concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of trust by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nposition of trust must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline H and the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis. \nApplicant\u2019s candor does not overcome the concerns raised by his repeated \nviolation of Federal drug laws and his expressed intent to continue to violate those laws. \nHe did not mitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.-1.b.: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEric H. Borgstrom \nEric H. Borgstrom \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

This account is not resolved. \nThe remaining two SOR allegations concern past-due state and federal income \ntaxes for TY 2019. On his 2020 SCA, Applicant disclosed that he spent the last six \nmonths of 2018 living and working in State 1. In January 2019, he relocated to State \n2(Item 3 at 9-10, 14-15) (He also disclosed an older tax lien, in State 2, from 2011 to \n2015, noting that it related to his ex-wife and past-due mortgage payments, but noted \nthat it was resolved. (Item 3 at 43). \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges that Applicant also owes $8,453 in past-due federal income \ntaxes for TY 2019. The amount is taken from his 2019 Form 1040. (Item 10 at 29). \nApplicant admitted the debt in his SOR response and said he was paying $200 a month \n(deducted from his checking account) to resolve it. (Item 2) This, too, is uncorroborated. \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleges that Applicant owes $2,257 in past-due income taxes to State \n1 for TY 2019. He admitted the debt and said in his SOR response that he was \nresolving it by paying $125 a month through a payment plan (as deducted from his \nchecking account), though this is not documented. (Item 2) In discussing his State 1 \ntaxes during his November 2022 background interview, Applicant said he worked with a \nfriend of a friend to file those returns, and that he still owed about $2,200 at that time. \nHe said he had set up a payment plan to pay his State 1 taxes at $125 a month, though \nfor a time he could not afford the payments. (Item 11 at 5-6) \nIn FORM Item 10, Applicant provided 2019 tax forms for State 1, which indicate \nthat he owed $2,545, as a State 1 non-resident or part-time resident, as calculated by a \nwell-known tax software program. (Item 10 at 21) Documentation of $2,257 as the \namount owed to State 1 for TY 2019, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g, is unclear, and $2,545 \nappears more accurate. (Item 10) \nApplicant did not offer an explanation for his tax issues in his SOR response. \nHowever, he stated in his SCA and his interrogatory response that he and his wife \ndivorced in 2018, and he experienced depression and anxiety.

(Item 3 at 38-39, Item 6 at 8) (Applicant\u2019s alcohol issues are not alleged in \nthe SOR and are noted here only as background). \nApplicant did not provide any documentation in response to the SOR and did not \nprovide any subsequent information or documentation about the status of the SOR \ndebts or about his overall financial situation. He did not respond to the FORM and did \nnot provide any additional materials despite being given the opportunity to do so by \nDepartment Counsel. Thus, he offered no information that was more current than his \nSOR response in mitigation of the financial security concerns established by the \nevidence. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe guideline sets forth several conditions that could raise security concerns \nunder AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;   \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.  \nApplicant incurred delinquent debts in recent years. This includes about $10,000 \n(combined) in past-due state and federal income taxes from TY 2019. The debts are \nestablished by the credit reports in evidence, by the tax documentation in the record, \nand, where applicable, by Applicant\u2019s admissions. The above disqualifying conditions \napply. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, as noted above, this shifts the burden to Applicant to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the established allegations. Applicant also has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nConditions that could mitigate financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \nAs noted above, Applicant did not provide updated information about the status \nof his debts after responding to the SOR, and never submitted any documentation about \nthem, despite having been given several opportunities to do so. He denied responsibility \nfor several debts, on the grounds that he did not recognize the creditors and said he did \nnot have accounts with them. The numerous credit reports provided by the Government, \nincluding a recent CBR from March 2024, say otherwise. Applicant did not provide any \ndocumentation to refute this, as required for mitigation consideration under AG \u00b6 20(e). \nApplicant\u2019s tax debt is limited to the 2019 tax year, a year in the aftermath of his \ndivorce and his DUI. While it is not clear that these issues led to his tax issues, it is also \nnot an unreasonable inference. He said in his background interview and in his SOR \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nresponse that the tax debts were being resolved through automatic withdrawals from his \nchecking account ($125 a month for the state taxes and $200 a month for the federal \ntaxes). There is no indication of a tax lien on any of his credit reports, but the payments \nare not proven by documentation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(g) therefore have only limited \napplication. \nApplicant\u2019s other debts are also not established as resolved. He denied most of \nthem, and provided no documentation of any efforts to pay, resolve, settle, or challenge \nany of them. Even if his debts are attributable to his divorce or its aftermath, he still has \nan obligation to act responsibly towards his creditors and to establish a reasonable, \ngood-faith payment plan. He has not established that any mitigating conditions should \nfully apply to his remaining debts. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nRegardless of the origin of his debts, Applicant did not provide any \ndocumentation of any efforts to pay, settle, resolve, or dispute any of the debts in the \nSOR. He needs to establish a documented track record of payments towards his debts \nto fully mitigate security concerns. This is not to say that Applicant cannot be a suitable \ncandidate for classified access in the future. Overall, however, the record evidence \nleaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Applicant did not mitigate financial security concerns. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nConsidering all the circumstances presented by the record, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nclassified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges foreign influence security concerns based on Applicant\u2019s friend who is a citizen and resident of Israel. His friend works for an Israeli technology company, and Applicant maintains regular contact with him. (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) Applicant admitted, with explanation, the single Guideline B allegation in his response to the SOR. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is a 46-year-old citizen of the United States. He married in 1999, and he and his wife have two children. He graduated in 1999 with a bachelor\u2019s degree, followed by a Master of Arts in history in 2001. He started his career in education where he served as a public-school teacher for 15 years teaching U.S. history. He also was employed by a community college as an adjunct professor teaching history and humanities. In approximately 2019, he left his career in education and began working in the computer engineering sector. In September 2021, he was hired by his current employer, a government contractor. His job title is product growth architect. In April 2022 Applicant was granted a Secret security clearance. His employer continues to sponsor him for a Top-Secret DOD security clearance.

This action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines implemented \nby the DOD on June 8, 2017.

I admitted all proffered exhibits into evidence without objection. \nDepartment Counsel also submitted materials for administrative notice concerning Israel, \nwhich I admitted as Administrative Notice (AN) I, without objection. The administrative \nnotice materials are included in the record to show the basis for concluding that the \nnoticed facts are well known, generally accepted within the U.S. government, and are not \nsubject to reasonable dispute. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on December 21, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges foreign influence security concerns based on Applicant\u2019s friend \nwho is a citizen and resident of Israel. His friend works for an Israeli technology company, \nand Applicant maintains regular contact with him. (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) Applicant admitted, with \nexplanation, the single Guideline B allegation in his response to the SOR. After a thorough \nand careful review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 46-year-old citizen of the United States. He married in 1999, and he \nand his wife have two children. He graduated in 1999 with a bachelor\u2019s degree, followed \nby a Master of Arts in history in 2001. He started his career in education where he served \nas a public-school teacher for 15 years teaching U.S. history. He also was employed by \na community college as an adjunct professor teaching history and humanities. In \napproximately 2019, he left his career in education and began working in the computer \nengineering sector. In September 2021, he was hired by his current employer, a \ngovernment contractor. His job title is product growth architect. In April 2022 Applicant \nwas granted a Secret security clearance. His employer continues to sponsor him for a \nTop-Secret DOD security clearance. (SOR response; GE 1, GE 2; Tr. 18-22) \nForeign Influence \nThe SOR alleges security concerns based on Applicant\u2019s friend, X, who is a citizen \nand resident of Israel. Applicant met X in June 2017 during a personal trip he took to \nIsrael with his best friend. Applicant was hired by his best friend to work for a well-known \ncompany in the U.S. as a consultant, and X was also hired as a consultant for the \ncompany team located in Israel. Applicant mainly had work-related email communications \nwith X during the following year trying to navigate the bureaucracy of a 30,000-person \nglobal corporation. (Tr. 23-25; SOR response) \nApplicant would communicate with X via electronic messaging and occasionally by \ntelephone. The frequency was sporadic, about once or twice a month. He and his best \nfriend met X in Paris in 2018, and they met X in New York a few times for work-related \nmeetings. Between 2020 and 2023, Applicant and X were included in a total of 13 email \nthreads with other recipients, and they only exchanged one direct email message. Their \ncommunications have only been social in nature and X has never once asked for \ninformation about Applicant\u2019s current work for a government contractor. X now works for \na technology company in Israel, which was acquired by an American company in 2015. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nApplicant did not possess a security clearance during the times he communicated with X, \nand their last direct electronic message took place in May 2020. (SOR response; Tr. 28-\n32) \nApplicant voluntarily disclosed X on his June 2022 security clearance application. \nIn early 2023, Applicant soon realized that X was a security concern during his \nbackground investigation, and he severed all communications with X. Whether or not his \nsecurity clearance is granted, Applicant has no intention of reinitiating contact with X. \n(SOR response; Tr. 28-32; GE 1) \nCharacter References: \nApplicant submitted several letters of recommendation by friends, co-workers, and \ncolleagues. All the references recommended Applicant be granted a Top-Secret security \nclearance because he is considered dedicated, trustworthy, and a loyal U.S. citizen. (AE \nA-F) \nAdministrative Notice \nI have taken administrative notice of the following facts concerning Israel: \nIsrael has forged close bilateral cooperation with the United States in many areas. \nA 10-year bilateral military aid memorandum of understanding commits the United States \nto provide Israel $3.3 billion in foreign military financing and spend $500 million annually \non joint missile defense programs from fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2028, subject to \ncongressional appropriations. \nAfter elections held on November 1, 2022, for Israel\u2019s parliament (Knesset), Likud \nparty leader Benjamin Netanyahu is again the prime minister, a post he held twice \npreviously, from 1996 to 1999 and 2009 to 2021. The 2022 election was the fifth held in \nIsrael since a formal process began in December 2018 addressing corruption allegations \nagainst Netanyahu. Two of the previous four elections did not result in the formation of a \ngovernment, and the other two resulted in short-lived coalition governments, a 2020 to \n2021 government with Netanyahu as prime minister, and a 2021 to 2022 government \nwithout him. The rise of the ultra-nationalist Religious Zionism faction as a likely \nNetanyahu coalition partner has triggered debate about the implications for Israel\u2019s \ndemocracy, its ability to manage tensions with Arabs and Palestinians, and its relations \nwith the United States and other countries. Israel has experienced an unprecedented \nperiod of political instability in recent years. \nA March 6, 2023 travel warning issued by the U.S. Department of State for Israel \nand the West Bank, urged U.S. travelers to exercise increased caution while traveling \ndue to terrorism and civil unrest. The Department of State has issued a travel advisory \nfor Gaza, urging U.S. travelers not to travel due to terrorism, civil unrest, and armed \nconflict. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nSignificant human rights issues in 2022 included credible reports of unlawful or \narbitrary killings; arbitrary detention, often extraterritorial detention of Palestinians from \nthe occupied territories in Israel; restrictions on Palestinians residing in Jerusalem \nincluding arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy, family, and home; substantial \ninterference with the freedom of association; arbitrary or unlawful interference with \nprivacy; harassment of nongovernmental organizations; significant restrictions on \nfreedom of movement within the country; violence against asylum seekers and irregular \nmigrants; violence or threats of violence against national, racial, or ethnic minority groups; \nand labor rights abuses against foreign workers and Palestinians from the West Bank. \nThe U.S. Department of State advises that all persons seeking to enter or depart \nIsrael, the West Bank, or Gaza are subject to immigration and security screening, possibly \nincluding prolonged questioning and physical searches, and may be denied entry or exit. \nSome U.S. citizens of Arab or Muslim heritage, including Palestinian-Americans, have \nexperienced significant difficulties, unequal, and occasionally hostile treatment at Israel\u2019s \nborders and checkpoints. Israeli security officials have also on occasion requested access \nto travelers\u2019 personal e-mail accounts or other social media accounts as a condition of \nentry. In such circumstances, travelers should have no expectation of privacy for any data \nstored on such devices or in their accounts. (AN I) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6 as follows: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nTwo disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant to this case: \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \nand \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding \n[sensitive] information from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to \nhave access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests \ninimical to those of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, \n2004).  \nTo establish AG \u00b6 7(a), the Government must demonstrate a \u201cheightened risk\u201d of \nexploitation due to Applicant\u2019s contact with his friend in Israel. Given the presence and \nactivities of several terrorist organizations hostile to the interests of the United States in \nIsrael, to include the current armed conflict, the Government has established the requisite \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d and potential conflict of interest regarding Applicant\u2019s contact with his \nfriend in Israel. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under this guideline are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nTerrorist organizations and current armed conflict pose an ongoing and critical \nthreat to U.S. interests in Israel. The United States and Israel are strong partners and \nfriends. Americans and Israelis are united by a shared commitment to democracy, \neconomic prosperity, and regional security. It is important to note, however, that the last \ndirect communication between Applicant and his friend, X, occurred in May 2020, before \nhe was hired by a government contractor. When Applicant and X worked for the same \nglobal corporation, their work-related contacts were regular. Their social contacts, \nhowever, have been sporadic and infrequent. There is no evidence that his friend was \naffiliated with the Israeli government, military, or defense industry. Applicant no longer \nmaintains a relationship with his friend in Israel, and he has severed all communications \nwith X. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(c) apply. \nSecurity-clearance determinations are predictive judgments as to whether an \nindividual will safeguard classified information. Applicant was born and raised in the \nUnited States. He taught U.S. history to middle school-aged children and college students \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfor 15 years. Applicant no longer has any ties or connections to anyone in Israel. He can \nbe expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. AG \u00b6 8(b) \napplies. Applicant mitigated the foreign influence security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline B and the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis. \nApplicant\u2019s friends, colleagues, and co-workers describe Applicant as a loyal U.S. \ncitizen. I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. The foreign connection was self-reported \nby Applicant, and he no longer maintains contact with his friend who resides in Israel and \nworks for a technology company. There is no derogatory information about Applicant in \nthe record. His close relationship with his wife, children, extended family members, and \nfriends are such that any conflict of interest can be expected to be resolved in favor of the \nU.S. interest. I conclude Applicant mitigated the foreign influence security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, I conclude \nthat it is clearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nPamela C. Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b. His denials are incorporated into my findings of fact. Applicant is a 30-year-old employee of a DOD contractor. He started his employment in March 2020. This is his first time applying for a security clearance. He previously was granted a position of public trust when he worked as a contractor with another government agency from March 2019 to October 2019. He was unemployed between October 2019 to March 2020. He has a college degree. He is single and has no children. (Tr. 15-18, 30, GE 1) The SOR alleged Applicant was evaluated by a U.S. Government-approved licensed psychologist on February 24, 2023, who determined he met the criteria for Schizophrenia; Insomnia Disorder; and Social Anxiety Disorder. The psychologist determined Applicant has a condition that poses a risk to his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness pertaining to handling classified information. (SOR \u00b6 1.a: GE 2) The SOR also alleged that Applicant failed to follow treatment recommendations because he refused to take anti-psychotic medications prescribed by his treating psychiatrist.

The case was assigned to me on February 2, 2024. A Notice of \nHearing was issued on February 16, 2024, scheduling the hearing for March 20, 2024. \nThe hearing was held as scheduled. Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits \n(GE) 1 - 4, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified. The record was \nheld open to allow Applicant to submit documents. He timely submitted one document \nwhich was marked as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A and admitted without objection. DOHA \nreceived the transcript (Tr.) on March 29, 2024. \nProcedural Issue \nAt the beginning of the hearing, the Government withdrew the allegations under \nparagraph 2, Guideline B. \nSeveral facts in the decision are referred to in generic terms in the interests of \nprotecting the Applicant\u2019s privacy. The more detailed facts can be located in the case file.  \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and \n1.b. His denials are incorporated into my findings of fact.  \nApplicant is a 30-year-old employee of a DOD contractor. He started his \nemployment in March 2020. This is his first time applying for a security clearance. He \npreviously was granted a position of public trust when he worked as a contractor with \nanother government agency from March 2019 to October 2019. He was unemployed \nbetween October 2019 to March 2020. He has a college degree. He is single and has no \nchildren. (Tr. 15-18, 30, GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant was evaluated by a U.S. Government-approved \nlicensed psychologist on February 24, 2023, who determined he met the criteria for \nSchizophrenia; Insomnia Disorder; and Social Anxiety Disorder. The psychologist \ndetermined Applicant has a condition that poses a risk to his judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness pertaining to handling classified information. (SOR \u00b6 1.a: GE 2) The SOR \nalso alleged that Applicant failed to follow treatment recommendations because he \nrefused to take anti-psychotic medications prescribed by his treating psychiatrist. (SOR \u00b6 \n1.b: GE 2; GE 3 at 4; GE 4 at 2) \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant denies that he has schizophrenia because \nhe does not experience psychotic episodes, hallucinations, or any sort of breakdown that \nwould cause him to disclose classified information. He began to see a psychiatrist for \nparanoid thinking due to concerns about the role the internet plays in transmitting \ninformation. His believes his concerns about the internet heightened his own security \nperceptions and made him more vigilant about what he should and should not say on the \ninternet. The last time he had an episode was in 2019. He does not see himself having \nanother episode.

Each medication has left him barely able to function, especially when the \ndosage was increased. He claims he does not experience most of the symptoms these \ndrugs are meant to treat. He is willing to start a new medication plan, if the government \nbelieves it is in his best interest, but the ones he has tried do not work well. He believes \nhe knows himself best and feels the best with no medication at all.  (Response to SOR) \nBackground  \nTowards the end of his contracting job with another government agency in the fall \n2018, Applicant became concerned about his private information being disclosed to \npeople with whom he had not communicated with over the Internet. He began to \nunderstand how networks work and the extent of network security, resulting in daily \nthoughts about this issue. He testified that he left his employment with this contractor in \nOctober 2018 because he wanted to pursue other jobs. The government-approved \npsychologist [Dr. B] mentions in her evaluation that he left the job in October 2019 for \npersonal health reasons, specifically, his paranoia about computer security was getting \n\u201cout of hand.\u201d (Tr. 15 \u2013 18; GE 2 at 3) \nApplicant began to see Dr. A in early 2019 because he began to experience \nextreme paranoia. He felt he was being watched and talked about by other people and \nhaving anxiety. He felt that people were able to access the sites he was using on the \nInternet. He began to see Dr. A at the recommendation of one of his brothers. Dr. A \ndiagnosed Applicant with paranoid schizophrenia and prescribed him the drug Latuda \ndue to paranoid thoughts he was having regarding the use of computers and the concern \nthat other users were eavesdropping on information he provided without his consent. In \nOctober 2018, he quit his job because of the invasive thoughts he was having about the \nlack of privacy on the Internet. He is careful about how he uses technology. (Tr. 15 \u2013 21; \nGE 3 at 4; GE 4 at 2) \nApplicant meets with Dr. A between once a month or every two months. When he \nbegan taking Latuda it gave him a carefree feeling, but it also had inhibiting side effects. \nIt drained his energy, and he decided it was not doing much for him. Dr. A then prescribed \nhim Abilify. He took it for several months and stopped taking it because of the side effects. \nHe then tried Seroquel and the same pattern occurred. The drug eventually sapped his \nenergy. He stopped taking medication in early 2020. His paranoid thoughts did not \nincrease once he stopped taking medication. He has not taken medication for over four \nyears. He feels much better and has his energy back. Dr. A is concerned because he \ndoes not take his prescribed medications. She meets with him regularly to monitor his \nstatus. (Tr. 20-22) \nApplicant does not believe he has paranoid schizophrenia. He admits to being \noccasionally paranoid, but not at a high level. He testified that he is able to rationalize his \nthoughts. He does not hear voices. He believes Dr. A thinks his symptoms are much \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nworse than they are.

At the end of the \nhearing Applicant was given the opportunity to obtain a statement from Dr. A after the \nhearing. He chose not to submit a statement. He stated: \nI kind of wrote, you know, this on the \u2013 it said she thinks my symptoms are \nmuch worse than they are. So I don\u2019t think a letter from her would do any \ngood in this case, to be honest. (Tr. 45) \nEvaluation of Government-Approved Psychologist  \nThe information in this section comes from GE 2. \nDr. B, a licensed psychologist, was hired by DCSA CAS to evaluate Applicant in \nconnection with his application for a security clearance. Dr. B met with him on February \n24, 2023. The examination was conducted via secure video teleconference. Applicant \nconsented to the evaluation being conducted via video-teleconference instead of an in-\nperson evaluation. \nThe DCSA CAS referred Applicant due to a diagnosis of Paranoid Schizophrenia \nand unknown impact on functioning. The purpose of the evaluation was to answer the \nfollowing question: \nDoes the subject have any medical, psychological, psychiatric, emotional, \nor substance use conditions which could impair his judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness?   \nDr. B based her opinion on mental health treatment records provided by DCSA \nCAS, and Applicant\u2019s November 2021 e-QIP application. Dr. B also conducted clinical \ninterviews, observations, and administration of objective personality measures, \nPersonality Assessment Inventory (PAI); subjective report of symptoms via the Patient \nHealth Questionnaire (PHQ-9); Generalized Anxiety Disorder-y (GAD-7), PTSD Checklist \nfor DSM-5 (PCL-5), Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST-10), Mood Disorder \nQuestionnaire (MDQ), and Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test. \nApplicant told Dr. B he first sought mental treatment in January 2019 due to \ndeveloping paranoia about technology. He reported increased thoughts that others were \nobserving the messages he was sending others and realizing these thoughts were \n\u201cgetting out of hand.\u201d Applicant\u2019s father or brother referred him to his current and only \ntreating psychiatrist, Dr. A. He has met monthly with Dr. A since January or February \n2019. Review of his treatment records indicated Dr. A diagnosed him with \u201cParanoid \nSchizophrenia\u201d (DSM-IV-TR terminology) and described his paranoia as \u201csevere.\u201d Dr. A \ndid not recommend Applicant for a security clearance due to the severity of his disorder. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant told Dr. B that he was initially prescribed Latuda, then another \nantipsychotic that he could not recall (likely Abilify), and was finally prescribed Seroquel. \nHe did not like the side effects of these medications and has not been compliant with the \ndosage recommendations beyond \u201ctwo to three months.\u201d He described the antipsychotic \nmedications caused \u201cextreme tiredness\u201d and he does not feel like himself when he takes \nthem. Dr. A is aware that he does not take his medication. Dr. A continues to prescribe \nthe medications in case he needs them. Applicant told Dr. B that he has not taken \nantipsychotic medication for several years. He meets with Dr. A monthly. They discuss \nhow he is doing, his overall mood and whether he is having any paranoia. They also \ndiscuss his ongoing difficulties with social anxiety and insomnia. Dr. A prescribed him \nXanax for his social anxiety. \nApplicant discussed his ongoing difficulties with insomnia. He has difficulties falling \nand staying asleep. He achieves five hours of sleep each night. He frequently takes over- \nthe-counter Melatonin, 20 mg, and will drink alcohol before bed at least two nights a week \nto induce sleep. He can be tired during the day but relies on energy drinks and coffee to \noffset symptoms of poor sleep. His current consumption of alcohol is at least one five-\nounce glass of wine approximately two nights per week.  \nApplicant noted he continues to experience paranoid thoughts but does not believe \nthey rise to the level of a psychiatric condition. He told Dr. B, \u201cI don\u2019t think I have a \npsychiatric condition. I think this is different. I\u2019m too analytical to have paranoid \nschizophrenia. It\u2019s not like those things [the connections he\u2019s making] aren\u2019t there. I have \na basis for it.\u201d He manages his paranoid beliefs via challenging his thinking. He stated \nthat he will brush them off, tell himself that this is absurd or something like that. He \nchooses to not communicate via Short Message Service (SMS) or via chat apps at work \nor home as an attempt to mitigate his paranoid beliefs. He believes this helps reduce his \ndistorted thinking. \nDr. B noted Applicant arrived on time for his scheduled evaluation. He was alert \nand oriented to all spheres. His attention and concentration appeared within normal limits. \nHis comprehension was normal and no unusual mannerisms were observed. During the \nevaluation, he denied and did not appear to respond to hallucinations, perceptual \ndisturbances, or psychotic features. His thought content was normal and appropriate to \nthe situation. He did not appear to be making attempts at deception during the evaluation. \nDuring the clinical interview Applicant denied he is currently experiencing any \nsevere symptoms consistent with those that precipitated his psychiatric treatment. He \nbelieves his paranoia is under control. He denied a history of planning or attempting \nsuicide. He denies current or past homicidal ideation, plan, means, or intent. He denied \ncurrent or past difficulties with impulsivity, distractibility, or inattention. He denied a history \nof derealization and depersonalization, and auditory, visual, or tactile hallucinations. He \ndenied episodes of violent behavior, uncontrollable anger, or unprovoked outbursts. He \ndenied a history of maltreatment or abuse. There is no evidence presented during the \nclinical interview, or indicated in available records, that Applicant ever abused alcohol, \nillicit substances, or engaged in the misuse of prescription medications. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn the Diagnostic Impressions & Prognosis section of her evaluation report, Dr. B \nstates: \n[Applicant\u2019s] perspective of his delusions are that they do not rise to the \nlevel of a psychiatric condition and therefore he is noncompliant with his \nprovider\u2019s medical recommendations. Beyond this he continues to \nexperience difficulties with social anxiety and sleep disturbance that could \nhave an appreciable impact on the frequency and intensity of his \nschizophrenia, particularly because he continues to use alcohol as a means \nto manage his sleep. At this time, even though he reports functioning fairly \nwell, the degree to which psychosocial stressors or his uncontrolled \ninsomnia will have on his psychiatric presentation in the future (GE 2 at 5-\n6) \nBased on his background information, clinical interview and observations, \npsychological screeners, and objective personality assessment, Dr. B concluded his \ndiagnostic profile is F20.9 Schizophrenia; F51.01 Insomnia Disorder; and F40.10 Social \nAnxiety Disorder. Dr. B concludes Applicant does currently present with a condition that \ncould pose a risk to his judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness concerning classified \ninformation. She notes that, although Applicant believes he is currently managing his \npsychosis via cognitive challenging and avoiding some versions of technology, there is \nno guarantee that he will be able to continue avoiding these technological applications \nwith his positions for the government or that his work would not force him to utilize \ntechnology more robustly in a manner that would ultimately increase the frequency and \nseverity of his paranoid beliefs in the future. (GE 2 at 6) \nConsidering his uncontrolled sleep functioning and the co-relation between poorly \nmanaged sleep and paranoia in the general population, let alone in those with existing \npsychosis by virtue of their psychiatric condition, the degree to which Applicant\u2019s paranoid \nthought processes will be exacerbated over time are unclear at this time in the context of \ntreatment non-compliance and a strong belief on his part that he does not meet diagnostic \ncriteria for a psychiatric condition and therefore does not need any psychotropic \nmedication at this time. Dr. B concludes that based on these reasons, the risk to judgment \nand reliability of any future mental health problem is deemed to be high at this time. (GE \n2 at 6) \nWhole-Person Factors \nMr. V, the principal at Applicant\u2019s place of employment, has worked with Applicant \nfor over four years. Applicant has held multiple roles during this time. He is described as \na strong learner of technology and self-taught. His ability to self-learn and be proactive \nhas helped his project team. He has received positive reviews from the project leads and \nthe technical leads on the two projects he has worked on. He accepts critical feedback \nand applies the feedback to his duties. He has been requested by other project leads \nbecause of his work ethic and technical ability. He is described as \u201cvery professional, \n6 \n\n \nquietly focused, and collaborative.\u201d He has made a tremendous contribution to the \ncompany over the four plus years he was worked there. Mr. V would recommend him for \nany position he chooses to pursue but hopes that he stays with the company.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec.

Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information.

A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline may be applicable: \nAG \u00b6 28(b): an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that \nthe individual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness; and  \nAG \u00b6 28(d): failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan related to a \ndiagnosed psychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, \nstability, reliability, or trustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to \ntake prescribed medication or failure to attend required counseling \nsessions. \nI find AG \u00b6\u00b6 28(b) and 28(d) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. AG \u00b6 28(b) applies because \nDr. A, a psychiatrist whom he has met with since January 2019 on a monthly or bimonthly \nbasis diagnosed him with paranoid schizophrenia. Although Dr. A\u2019s diagnosis and \ncredentials were not offered into evidence, Dr. B, the licensed psychologist who evaluated \nApplicant at the request of the CAS, mentions in her evaluation that she reviewed his \nmental health treatment records provided by Dr. A. In her evaluation, Dr. B mentioned \nthat Dr. A does not recommend him for a security clearance due to the severity of his \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndisorder, even if he took his medication. While it would be preferrable to have had access \nto Applicant\u2019s mental health records, Dr. B\u2019s review of the records establishes a prima \nfacie case. In fact, Dr. B\u2019s diagnosis after her evaluation was that Applicant suffered from \nSchizophrenia; Insomnia; and Social Anxiety Disorder. Dr. B concluded that he has a \ncondition that poses a risk to his judgment, reliability, or trustworthiness concerning \nclassified information. \nAG \u00b6 28(d) applies because Applicant admits he no longer takes his prescribed \nmedications against the professional advice of Dr. A. He stopped taking his medications \nover four years ago. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 29(a): the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, \nand the individual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance \nwith the treatment plan; \nAG \u00b6 29(b): the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional; \nAG \u00b6 29(c): recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that \nan individual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has \na low probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \nAG \u00b6 29(d): the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications \nof emotional instability; and \nAG \u00b6 29(e): there is no indication of a current problem. \nThe mitigating conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 29(a), 29(b), and \u00b6\u00b6 29(c) do not apply. While \nApplicant regularly meets with Dr. A, he refuses to take his medication. In other words, \nhe is not consistent with his treatment plan. He has not provided a favorable prognosis \nfrom his treating psychiatrist, Dr. A, or from the Government-approved psychologist, Dr. \nB. He did not seek an evaluation from another duly-qualified mental health professional \nto determine whether the original and affirmed diagnosis is correct. \nThe mitigating conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 29(d) and 29(e) apply. Applicant sought \ntreatment for his paranoid thoughts. While a security concern remains because he refuses \nto take his medication, he has remained stable since Mar 2020 and there appear to be \nno indications of a current problem. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDespite the mitigating factors in AG \u00b6\u00b6 29(d) and 29(e), I cannot conclude \nApplicant mitigated the concerns under Guideline I, because the record evidence does \nnot include a favorable medical prognosis from a duly-qualified mental health professional \nor a favorable prognosis from a Government \u2013 approved psychologist. The concern is not \nApplicant\u2019s current condition, which is stable, but the probability that his mental health \nissues will recur or be exacerbated in the future. In particular, the concern is heightened \nbecause he refuses to take his medication. Based on the above considerations, I \nconclude that the security concerns under Guideline I are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline I in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I considered Applicant\u2019s cooperation \nthroughout his background investigation. I considered his employment history as a \ncontractor for the U.S. government. I considered the highly favorable comments of Mr. V, \nhis superior at his current place of employment. I considered his willingness to seek help \nfor his mental health issues. I considered that he has not had a significant mental health \nepisode in over four years. Considering the seriousness of his diagnosis, security \nconcerns remain because the record evidence does not include a favorable prognosis \nfrom a duly qualified mental health professional and/or a duly-qualified mental health \nprofessional approved by the U.S. Government. While Applicant is currently mentally \nstable and sees Dr. A on a regular basis, his refusal to take his prescribed medications \nraises a concern regarding future mental health episodes. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline I and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns raised under the Psychological Conditions. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \nWithdrawn by the Government \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nWithdrawn by the Government \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

His admission is incorporated into \nthe findings of fact. Based on my review of the pleadings, evidence submitted, and \ntestimony, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 43 years old. He was married in 2003. He has one adult child. He \nearned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2003. He has worked for a government contractor as a \nsoftware engineer since 2021. He previously held a security clearance for about ten \nyears. (Tr. 18-20; GE 1) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant owes the IRS $77,570 in delinquent taxes for tax \nyears 2009-2013, and 2017. \nApplicant reported his financial problems started in 2008. His wife took a fellowship \nin another city, a location that had a high cost of living. The fellowship lasted four years, \nand she was only able to earn a yearly stipend of about $20,000, which did not cover her \nrent or living expenses. He was earning about $80,000 annually and had to assist her \nand maintain their regular expenses at home. (Tr. 20-69) \nAs a result of this financial burden, Applicant was unable to pay what was owed \nfor their 2009 federal income taxes. Their home state does not have income taxes. He \nhad the same issue in 2010. He decided a better paying job would solve the problem. In \n2011, he started a new job as a 1099 employee, and while it looked like he was going to \nearn more, he did not understand the tax implications. Once he realized that federal \nincome taxes were not being withheld from his pay and the resulting tax consequence, \nhe started looking for a new job. He did not file federal income tax returns for the years \nhe could not afford to pay the taxes owed. (Tr. 20-69) \nIn 2013, Applicant obtained a regular salaried job, and hired a tax professional to \nassist in filing missing returns and to adjust paycheck withholdings. He worked with this \nprofessional until 2020. In 2013, he also sought consumer credit counseling because he \nhad acquired a large amount of consumer debt and was behind on the family\u2019s mortgage. \nIn 2013, they incurred unexpected home repair and homeowner association costs. (Tr. \n20-69) \nApplicant and his wife had been unable to have children. She started a new job in \n2014, which covered some in vitro fertilization (IVF) costs. They incurred about $15,000 \nin IVF costs that year. His wife turned 35 in 2015, which is considered an advanced \nmaternal age to have a child, and the IVF rate of success is greatly reduced. They spent \nat least $10,000 annually on IVF costs from 2015 to 2018. They also had additional \nunexpected home expenses during these years, including air conditioner replacement. \n(Tr. 20-69) \nApplicant reported that their IVF costs and home repair costs prevented them from \nbeing able to pay their existing federal income tax debt and their taxes for 2017 as well. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHe eventually adjusted their W-4 forms to minimize their exemptions. This caused them \nto overpay taxes in their biweekly paychecks, and the IRS applied the refund amounts to \ntheir back taxes when they filed returns. (Tr. 20-69) \nIn 2019, Applicant\u2019s wife started a new job, and their IVF costs were about $16,000. \nIn 2020, their health insurance changed and his wife turned 40 years old. They had to \nreplace their roof for about $15,000 and had $30,000 in IVF costs. In 2021, they had \n$22,000 of IVF costs. That year his wife was diagnosed with a condition that would make \nit hard to get pregnant. After the diagnosis they gave up on IVF. (Tr. 20-69) \nIn 2022, their health insurance offered new IVF and fertility health coverage. They \nwere told they had no more than a 15% chance of success, and the rate of success would \ndrop every month. They had about $3,000 of IVF costs. After more attempts, they decided \na surrogate was their only option. They spent $60,000 to start the match process with a \nsurrogate agency. They also had additional home expenses of about $10,000. (Tr. 20-\n69; AE G) \nIn 2023, they matched with a surrogate. Their costs were $125,000 and her \nmedical expenses, which exceeded $10,000. It was determined that she would not be a \nsuccessful surrogate, so the process started over again. A second surrogate had $20,000 \nof medical costs. This surrogate was able to become pregnant, and she is due soon. \nHowever, in mid-2023 his wife was diagnosed with a serious medical condition which \nrequires significant medical intervention. (Tr. 20-69; AE H, I) \nApplicant estimated that they spent about $300,000 on the IVF and surrogacy \nprocess. He resolved their consumer debts and mortgage delinquency over the years, \nbut not their tax debt. They have not owed new tax debts to the IRS since 2018. They \nfailed to timely file their federal income tax returns from 2009 to 2014, but all their filings \nsince have been timely. They currently owe past-due taxes for 2009, 2010, and 2012 \nwhich total about $62,000. (Tr. 20-93; AE A, C, U) \nApplicant and his wife jointly earn about $330,000 annually. They have about \n$5,000 left over after their monthly expenses. Applicant reported that he saved about \n$20,000 to apply to their tax debt but will not send it until his wife\u2019s health issues are \nresolved. He claimed that he has already paid the IRS about $20,000 towards their back \ntaxes. This amount was mainly from recaptured refunds. He submitted evidence showing \nthat he has made four tax payments, totaling $5,210, since March 2020. (Tr. 70-93; GE \n2; AE B, O, Q, R, S, T) \nApplicant claimed that he tried to set up installment agreements with the IRS in \n2014 and 2023, but the monthly amounts they required were too high to agree to. In \nMarch 2024, he and his wife also submitted abatement requests to reduce their tax \nburden, which have not yet been decided. They continue to pay their back taxes owed \nthrough recaptured refunds. In 2023, about $20,000 was taken from a refund they were \nowed and applied to their tax debt.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nFailure to comply with tax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with \nabiding by well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with \nrules and systems is essential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 16-01726 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required. \nThe financial considerations security concerns are established by the tax records \nand Applicant\u2019s admissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c) and 19(f) apply. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond  \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. Applicant failed to provide sufficient documentation \nshowing that his tax issues are being resolved through a formal payment process, or that \nhis tax problems occurred under such circumstances that they are unlikely to recur. His \nunresolved tax debts are long-term, ongoing, and unresolved. This continues to cast \ndoubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. There is insufficient evidence to show that Applicant\u2019s \nfinancial problems occurred under circumstances beyond his control, and that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. The IVF and surrogacy costs are not unexpected \nmedical emergency expenses or beyond their control. Their home repair costs may have \nbeen inconvenient but were typically the kind of expenses that homeowners incur with an \naging home. Moreover, Applicant failed for several years to exercise due diligence and to \nfile his tax returns, even if he was not able to pay what he owed. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) does not apply. Applicant submitted limited evidence that in 2014 and \n2023 he had payment plan discussions with the IRS. He also made four payments in the \nlast four and a half years, totaling $5,210. Most of the progress in reducing their tax debt \nover the last 15 years has been attributable to IRS recapture of their income tax refunds. \nRelying on refund recapture does not constitute an arrangement to resolve or a good faith \neffort to resolve a tax debt. \nSince 2008, Applicant and his wife have made some poor financial decisions and \nincurred costs associated with home ownership. They have also spent about $300,000 \non IVF and the surrogacy process. However, given their substantial income these costs \nhave not prevented them from timely filing their federal income tax returns, making \narrangements to pay taxes due or voluntarily making payments on their large federal tax \ndebt. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations, such as paying \ntaxes when due, does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability \nrequired of those granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-\n01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I considered his character letter, and work performance \ndocumentation. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. He did not provide sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. This decision should not be \nconstrued as a determination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform \nnecessary for eligibility for access to classified information in the future. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security \nclearance.

The United States was the first country \nto recognize Israel as a state in 1948, and the first to recognize Jerusalem as the capital \nof Israel in 2017. A long-standing U.S. priority is to promote a comprehensive and lasting \nsolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \nAlmost half of Israel\u2019s exports are high technology, including electronic and \nbiomedical equipment. The United States is Israel\u2019s largest trading partner. \nThe U.S. and Israel have close cultural, historic, and political ties. They participate \nin joint military planning and training, and they have collaborated on military research and \nweapons development. Commitment to Israel\u2019s security has been a cornerstone of U.S. \nMiddle East policy since Israel\u2019s creation in 1948. \nIsrael has been identified as a major practitioner of industrial espionage against \nU.S. companies. There have been instances of illegal export, or attempted illegal export, \nof U.S. restricted, dual-use technology to Israel. Israel has become a major global leader \nin arms exports, and the United States and Israel have periodically disagreed over Israeli \nsales of sensitive U.S. and Israeli technologies to third-party countries, including China. \nIsrael generally respects the rights of its citizens. When human-rights violations \nhave occurred, they have usually involved Palestinians. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nIsrael considers U.S. citizens who also hold Israeli citizenship or have a claim to \ndual nationality to be Israeli citizens for immigration and other legal purposes. U.S. \ncitizens visiting Israel have been subjected to prolonged questioning and thorough \nsearches by Israeli authorities upon entry or departure. \nTerrorist suicide bombings are a continuing threat in Israel, and U.S. citizens in \nIsrael are advised to be cautious. On October 7, 2023, Hamas militants launched \ncombined ground and rocket attacks into southern Israel. Hamas has been the de facto \ngoverning authority in the Gaza strip since 2007. The Department of State has issued a \n\u201cdo not travel\u201d advisory for Gaza due to terrorism and armed conflict. It has also issued a \n\u201creconsider travel\u201d advisory to Israel and the West Bank due to terrorism and civil unrest. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan at 531. Substantial \nevidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d See ISCR \nCase No. 17-04166 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2019) It is \u201cless than the weight of the \nevidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence \ndoes not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d \nConsolo v. Federal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d \nis \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area \nTransit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a nexus or \nrational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed therein and \nan applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual maybe manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe following disqualifying conditions are relevant: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \nand \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those \nof the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nFurthermore, \u201ceven friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity.\u201d ISCR Case No. 00-0317 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002). Finally, we know friendly \nnations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, \nscientific, and technical fields. Nevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its \nrelationship with the United States, and its human-rights record are relevant in assessing \nthe likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country \nhas an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon \nthe government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States. In considering the nature of the government, an administrative judge must \nalso consider any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR Case No. \n02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) (reversing decision to grant clearance where \nadministrative judge did not consider terrorist activity in area where family members \nresided). \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened \nrisk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low standard. It \ndenotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family member living under \na foreign government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-05839 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 2013). \nIt is a level of risk one step above a State Department Level 1 travel advisory (\u201cexercise \nnormal precaution\u201d) and equivalent to the Level 2 advisory (\u201cexercise increased caution\u201d). \nWhen family ties to a foreign country are involved, the totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties \nto a foreign country as well as each individual family tie must be considered. ISCR Case \nNo. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2003). \nThe security concern in this case is based heavily on Applicant\u2019s family members\u2019 \nmilitary service in the IDF. However, only one of Applicant\u2019s many cousins and aunts and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntheir spouses continued to serve in the IDF after completing mandatory service, and she \nis a low-ranking officer performing duty as an educator. In the past, we have recognized \nthat an applicant\u2019s ties, either directly or through a family member, to persons of high rank \nin a foreign government or military are of particular concern, insofar as it is foreseeable \nthat through an association with such persons the applicant could come to the attention \nof those interested in acquiring U.S. protected information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-\n10025 at 2 and 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2009) (Applicant\u2019s brother was a high-level foreign \ngovernment official); ISCR Case No.11-04980 at 2 and 6 (App. Bd. Sep. 21,2012) \n(Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law was married to a retired high-ranking official in a foreign \narmy);and ISCR Case No. 11-12632 at 2 and 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 2, 2015) None of \nApplicant\u2019s aunts, cousins and their spouses have occupied or now occupy high-ranking \npositions in the IDF, the Israeli government, intelligence services, or defense-related \nindustries.  \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s feelings of a cultural connection to Israel were demonstrated when she \nchose to live in Israel to study Hebrew for four months. Her interest in Israeli culture and \nthe large number and frequency of her family contacts in Israel are sufficient to establish \nthe \u201cheightened risk\u201d in AG \u00b6 26(a) and the potential conflict of interest in AG \u00b6 26(b). \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; and \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \nAG \u00b6 8(a) is established. Israel is a friendly country and the positions and activities \nof Applicant\u2019s aunts, cousins, and their spouses (medical professionals, teachers, a tax \nadviser, store owners, and retirees) are such that a conflict of interest is unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 8(b) is established. Applicant\u2019s deep and longstanding loyalties to her \nparents, husband, brother, friends, and career in the United States are such that she can \nbe expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States. \nWhole-Person Concept \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant was candid, sincere and \ncredible at the hearing . After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline B and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by her connections to Israel. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B (Foreign Influence): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.f: \nFor Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

I adopt his admissions as findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 33 years old. He has worked for his current employer, a federal contractor, since August 2023. He served in the USMC for six and a half years. He attained the rank of first lieutenant. He resigned his commission in lieu of facing a Board Officers in an involuntary separation action. He received a General Under Honorable Conditions discharge in November 2020. After his discharge he changed locations and worked for two government contractors before taking his current position. (Tr. 22-26; GE 1; AE W) He is married for the second time. His first marriage was from 2016 to April 2021, although they had physically separated in June 2019. He has a six-year-old child from this marriage for whom he pays monthly child support. He also pays alimony to his ex- 2 wife (W1). His total monthly support payments to W1 and his child are $1,864. He married for the second time in July 2022.

The Government\u2019s exhibit list was marked as hearing exhibit (HE) I \nand its disclosure letter was marked as HE II. Applicant testified, presented the \ntestimony of three witnesses, and offered exhibits (AE) A-R. These exhibits were \nadmitted without objection.

Applicant\u2019s \nwitness list and three exhibit lists are marked HE III to VI. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on May 24, 2024. \nProcedural Issue \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR to include an \nallegation under Guideline E, Personal Conduct. He argued that that Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony concerning the circumstances leading to his separation from the U.S. Marine \nCorps (USMC) established the factual background for the amendment. The proposed \namendment is as follows: \nOn or about November 2020, you were administratively separated from \nthe USMC following nonjudicial punishment (NJP) for an affair with a \nfellow officer. \nI informed Applicant\u2019s counsel that I would grant him whatever time he needed to \nrespond to the proposed amendment. After taking a short recess to discuss the matter \nwith his client, counsel chose to proceed without asking for a continuance or a delay. \nAdditionally, he stated that Applicant \u201cdenied\u201d the proposed amendment. We then took \nadditional testimony on the issue. I granted the motion to amend. (Tr. 122-128) \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer, he admitted the allegation under Guideline J, and one \nallegation under Guideline F. He denied the remaining allegations. I adopt his \nadmissions as findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and \nexhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 33 years old. He has worked for his current employer, a federal \ncontractor, since August 2023. He served in the USMC for six and a half years. He \nattained the rank of first lieutenant. He resigned his commission in lieu of facing a Board \nOfficers in an involuntary separation action. He received a General Under Honorable \nConditions discharge in November 2020. After his discharge he changed locations and \nworked for two government contractors before taking his current position. (Tr. 22-26; GE \n1; AE W) \nHe is married for the second time. His first marriage was from 2016 to April 2021, \nalthough they had physically separated in June 2019. He has a six-year-old child from \nthis marriage for whom he pays monthly child support.

His total monthly support payments to W1 and his child are $1,864. He \nmarried for the second time in July 2022. He has a six-year-old stepdaughter and a \nbiological daughter with his wife (W2). He holds a bachelor\u2019s degree and is enrolled in a \nmasters\u2019 program. (Tr. 40, 42, 87-88, 113-115; AE L) \nThe SOR alleged, under Guideline J, that on August 25, 2021, Applicant was \narrested and charged with third-degree assault and harassment. He pled guilty to a \nlesser charge of harassment-strike/shove/kick. He was sentenced to 24 months of \nsupervised probation and ordered to attend domestic violence counseling. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \nThe SOR alleged, under Guideline F, that Applicant was delinquent on six \ncharged-off accounts totaling approximately $58,253. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.f) \nThe Guideline E allegation was previously noted above and was the amendment \nto the SOR stated on the record. (Tr. 122-128) \nCriminal Conduct and Personal Conduct \nApplicant admitted the allegation under Guideline J and denied the allegation \nunder Guideline E. Because the two allegations are tangentially related, they will be \ndiscussed together. Appellant admitted that in September 2019, after he and W1 \nphysically separated, with her moving to a different state, he began a sexual \nrelationship with a fellow USMC officer. At some point, W1 became aware of the \nrelationship and informed his command. Once informed, his command took action \nagainst both parties in the form of administering NJP under Uniform Code of Military \nJustice (UCMJ), Article 15, for the offense of Adultery. His punishment consisted of a \n$4,000 fine. In addition to the NJP, Appellant was facing an involuntary separation \naction from the USMC. In lieu of facing a board of officers in an administrative \nseparation action, he offered his resignation. His resignation was accepted and in \nNovember 2020, he was discharged from the USMC with a General Discharge, under \nHonorable Conditions. (Tr. 23, 48, 88, 116, 125-127; AE W) \nAfter his discharge, Appellant pursued jobs with government contractors. He was \nhired in late 2020 and moved to a different state. At that time, he remained in the \nrelationship with the former officer (Ms. X) with whom he had an affair leading to both of \ntheir discharges. Ms. X moved with him to the new location and lived together in an \napartment. They split the rent and all other expenses. They became engaged. In August \n2021, he was on a work trip that was scheduled to last two weeks. The trip ended early, \nand he returned home on Wednesday, August 18th. Upon entering his apartment, he \nnoticed two packed bags by the doorway. Ms. X was surprised to see him. She claimed \nthe bags were her workout gear. They then had sex. Afterward, Appellant was not \nconvinced about Ms. X\u2019s story explaining the bags and continued questioning her. She \nadmitted that she was on her way to another city to meet a former boyfriend at a hotel. \nThey had a heated argument. Appellant admitted slapping her once in anger and \npushing her face. He did not see any red marks on her face. Ms. X would later tell the \npolice that he slapped her five times and pushed her face into the bed without restricting \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nher breathing. On cross-examination, he denied striking her five times. After the \nphysical contact, Ms. X separated from Appellant and later slept in the garage while he \nslept in the bedroom. She left the apartment permanently shortly thereafter and never \nreturned. She sent a friend over to pick up her belongings. (Tr. 29-32, 88-89; GE 7) \nAppellant testified that after Ms. X left the house, she refused to communicate \nwith him in any fashion. He wanted her to pay her share of rent, which was due. He \ntexted her about the rent, but she did not respond. The following Monday, he decided to \ngo to her gym and ask her about the rent money. Upon arriving at the gym, he saw her \nand she saw him. She turned away and went in a different direction. He did not \napproach her or talk to her there. He just left. The next day, August 24th, around \nmidnight, the police came to Appellant\u2019s apartment and arrested him for the incident \noccurring on August 18th. He was charged with third degree assault (a class one \nmisdemeanor) and harassment (a class three misdemeanor). (Tr. 32-34; GE 7) \nOther aspects of the police investigation into the complaint filed by Ms. X \nincluded that when an officer contacted Ms. X on August 24th, after her complaint, he \ndid not see any redness or bruising on her face or neck. The investigation also revealed \nthreatening texts that Appellant sent to Ms. X in August 2019. The officer asked Ms. X \nwhy she had not reported them at the time, and she said because she was \u201cstupid.\u201d Ms. \nX was also concerned that Appellant had placed an electronic tracking device on her \ncar so he could follow her. While an empty box for a tracking device was found at \nAppellant\u2019s residence, no device was found on Ms. X\u2019s car. When asked about this, \nAppellant stated that the device was for his child so he and W1 could place it into the \nchild\u2019s backpack for her safety and security. No charge resulted from this concern by \nMs. X. [I will not consider any incidents not specifically alleged in the SOR, for \ndisqualification purposes, but I may use it for credibility, mitigation, and whole-person \nconsiderations] (Tr. 89-90; GE 7) \nAppellant pleaded guilty to the class three misdemeanor harassment charge and \nthe class one charge was dismissed. He was sentenced to 24 months supervised \nprobation and ordered to attend a domestic violence course. Upon successful \ncompletion of his sentencing requirements, the charge he pleaded to would be \ndismissed. He successfully completed his probation on November 29, 2023, with no \nviolations. He also successfully completed the domestic violence course, and his case \nwas dismissed. A protective order had been issued when Appellant was charged and \nthat was dismissed when his probation ended. He had no contact with Ms. X after \nseeing her at the gym. She attended one court hearing, but since that time he has not \nseen her or had contact with her. (Tr. 34, 36-39, 91-92; GE 8) \nThe domestic violence course that Appellant attended issued an end-of-course \nevaluation. It noted that he demonstrated knowledge and internalization in the 18 core \ncompetencies covered by the course. He also completed an autobiography, a personal \nchange plan, an apology letter, and an aftercare plan. He testified that he learned the \nP.A.U.S.E. technique from the course, which stands for Pay attention, Acknowledge, \nUnderstand, Seek clarification, and Elaborate.

He denied ever having a domestic \nviolence incident with W1 or W2 and there is no evidence to the contrary. (Tr. 92, 117-\n119; AE A) \nFinancial Considerations \nAppellant\u2019s financial difficulties began in approximately 2019, when his marriage \nbroke up and he started the relationship that led to his discharge. He was assigned to \nhis first duty station in approximately 2018. His first child was born in April 2018. At this \nduty station, W1 was away from her family and Appellant was working long hours. W1 \nseemed to have no energy to take care of the house or baby. Appellant believed she \nsuffered from postpartum depression. In the summer of 2019, they decided it would be \nbest if W1 and the baby went to live with W1\u2019s mother in another state. Initially, this was \nto be a temporary arrangement. Later, in the summer, they decided to make the \nseparation permanent and pursue divorce. It was about this same time that he started \nhis involvement with Ms. X. (Tr. 40, 42-45) \nAt the time of the initial separation, Appellant was living in an apartment close to \nthe base. His monthly rent and related expenses were approximately $2,460. He was \nalso voluntarily paying W1 $600 per month. He felt that because she was living with her \nmother rent free, this was enough to pay the expenses for W1 and his child. W1 \ncontacted his command seeking additional financial support from him. His command \nordered him to pay her approximately $2,000 per month to cover both spousal and child \nsupport. He paid this amount until he was discharged in November 2020. This is when \nhe was unable to make all his financial commitments. He had to take out loans to pay all \nhis bills. He tried several avenues to improve his financial situation. He sought \npermission from the USMC to move onto base as a geographic bachelor, which would \nallow him not to pay rent any longer. This request was denied. He also went to the \nMarine Corps Relief Society seeking financial assistance, which was also denied. (Tr. \n45-47, 49, 51) \nAfter Appellant\u2019s discharge and before his divorce was finalized, he voluntarily \npaid W1 $800 monthly. His income between 2020 and 2022 started at $90,000 and rose \nto $113,000. When the divorce was finalized in April 2021, he was ordered to pay W1 \n$1,864 monthly for child support and alimony. By this time, he had moved to a different \nstate and had secured a job. The state where the divorce took place required that the \npayment mechanism be through Appellant\u2019s employer in the form of a wage \ngarnishment. He complied with this order and the support was paid through his \nemployer and remains that way. His rent at his new location was approximately $2,000 \nmonthly, which he split with Ms. X, whom he lived with until August 2021. Thereafter, he \npaid the full rent. He incurred attorney\u2019s fees from the divorce. He discovered that W1 \nwas still using some of their credit cards during their separation and divorce pendency, \nfor which he remained responsible. (Tr. 25, 52-55) \nIn August 2021, he was unable to make his car payments. He contacted a debt \nrelief company (DRC) in May 2022.

It also recommended that the client stop making payments on the \nenrolled debts so that would give the company leverage with the creditors. Based on \nthis advice, Appellant stopped making payments to his creditors in May 2022 and \ncontracted with the DRC. He enrolled his debts in a payment plan. He documented \nmaking payments toward the settlement of two SOR debts beginning in June 2023 and \nOctober 2023. He paid between $400-$600 monthly to the DRC. (Tr. 61-62, 103-104; \nAE M) \nAppellant\u2019s mother passed away in March 2024 and left him an inheritance from \nan insurance policy in the amount of approximately $101,000. He immediately used \nsome of the proceeds to pay five of the SOR debts in May 2024, and he also set up a \npayment plan for the sixth debt. He did not use some of the remaining inheritance funds \nto totally pay the sixth debt because he and W2 decided it was better to leave some \nmoney to start an emergency account to have available so that they would not find \nthemselves in a similar position in the future. He disenrolled from the DRC when the \ninheritance funds became available to him. He also documented paying two non-SOR \ndebts. (Tr. 64, 77, 103, 105-106; AE B-C, V) \nThe current status of the SOR debts is as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a-$14,634. Appellant admitted this debt was for a loan he took out \nduring his divorce. Much of the loan was for the payment of attorney\u2019s fees. In May \n2024, he documented entering into a payment agreement by making an initial payment \nof $2,500 and then by setting up 26 monthly payments of $400. This debt is being \nresolved. (Tr. 75-76; AE R) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b-$3,054. Appellant admitted this debt was for a loan he took out during \nhis divorce. It was used to pay a retainer for his attorney. He documented paying this \ndebt In May 2024, using some of his inheritance. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 64-65; AE \nQ, U) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c-$1,224. Appellant admitted this debt was for a loan in the fall of 2019 \nto pay bills. He documented settling this debt In May 2024, using some of his \ninheritance. In 2022, he also received funds back from this creditor for charging illegal \ninterest. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 68-70; AE E, O) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d-$658. Appellant admitted this debt was for a credit card he opened in \norder to buy tires for his car. He documented paying this debt In May 2024, using some \nof his inheritance. This debt is resolved.

(AE I-K) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for criminal conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. Potentially applicable conditions include: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted.   \nIn August 2021, Applicant was arrested for assaulting and harassing Ms. X. He \npleaded guilty to the harassment charge, was sentenced to 24 months\u2019 probation, and \nwas ordered to attend domestic violence classes. He completed his probation with no \nviolations and attended and completed a domestic violence course. Once these \nsentencing conditions were satisfied, the harassment charge against him was \ndismissed. AG \u00b6 31(b) applies. \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for criminal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 32 and considered the following relevant: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nAppellant\u2019s criminal action happened approximately three years ago and there is \nno evidence of similar action since then. W2, who has been married to Appellant since \nJuly 2022, testified that he has never threatened or harassed her, but rather he has \nshown her total respect. Appellant no longer has contact with Ms. X. He successfully \ncompleted a domestic violence course and took away the tool of P.A.U.S.E. to help him \ndeal with the stressors of his relationships. He complied with all the conditions of his \nprobation. He is successful at his job and volunteers in his community. All these factors \npoint toward successful rehabilitation and an unlikeliness of recurrence. This incident no \nlonger casts doubt on Appellant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. Both of the \nmitigating conditions substantially apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to\ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security\ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Potentially applicable conditions include: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nApplicant resigned from the USMC in lieu of facing an administrative separation \naction. This action resulted because he received NJP from his command for committing \nadultery with a fellow officer, a criminal offense under the UCMJ. His actions showed \nquestionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. AG \u00b6 \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n16(c) is not perfectly applicable because the alleged conduct is sufficient and could \nhave been covered for an adverse determination under the criminal conduct. However, \nthe general concerns about questionable judgment and an unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations contained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 and 16(c) are established. \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for personal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 17 and considered the following relevant: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant is no longer a Marine. The alleged conduct was not minor, but it was a \none-time incident in 2020 and no similar incidents have occurred since then. AG \u00b6 17(c) \nsubstantially applies. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concerns for financial considerations:  \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19. Potentially applicable conditions include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe record evidence supports that Applicant incurred the six delinquent debts alleged in \nthe SOR. I find the above disqualifying conditions are raised. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial circumstances occurred during a period in his life that is \nunlikely to recur. He was administratively separated from the USMC and went through a \nseparation, then a divorce with his first wife. He was able to secure a good job shortly \nafter his discharge, but it still did not pay enough to cover all his financial obligations. He \nengaged a DRC to start to address his delinquent debts. Although his mother\u2019s death \nwas certainly an unfortunate event, it did provide him with an inheritance that he \nimmediately used to pay five of the SOR debts, set up a payment plan for the sixth debt, \npay W2\u2019s credit cards, and establish an emergency fund for the future. While it would \nhave been ideal if he started resolving the debts earlier than he did, sometimes life will \nnot allow that. He did the best he could under the circumstances and his debts are now \non track. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-20(c) all substantially apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered his character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline J, criminal \nconduct, Guideline E, personal conduct, and Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph   1.a:  \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs   2.a-2.f: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph   3.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 48-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for his current employer since January 2023. He previously worked for the same employer and held a security clearance from 2004 to 2014. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1999 and a master\u2019s degree in 2007. He is married with two children. (Tr. at 17-18, 28- 30, 35; GE 1, 2) Applicant lives in a state where recreational marijuana possession and use do not violate state law. Cultivation and sale of marijuana are also not against state law but are strictly regulated. After he was laid off in 2014, Applicant worked in a business owned by his father. They were approached by a marijuana grower about using their product in the business. They decided their existing product was not right for the cannabis industry, but they saw opportunities in that field. They developed software and hardware products that enabled marijuana growers to better comply with the state\u2019s regulations. They took their company public, with Applicant and his father the major shareholders. Applicant was also a senior executive in the company.

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 9, 2023, the Department of Defense (DoD) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline H. Applicant \nresponded to the SOR on August 4, 2023, and requested a decision based on the \nwritten record in lieu of a hearing. The Government\u2019s written case consisted of a file of \nrelevant material (FORM). Applicant responded to the FORM on December 18, 2023, \nand changed his request to a hearing before an administrative judge. \nThe case was assigned to me on February 1, 2024. The hearing convened as \nscheduled on April 4, 2024. Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 3 were admitted in \nevidence without objection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) A \nthrough H, which were admitted without objection.

He has worked for \nhis current employer since January 2023. He previously worked for the same employer \nand held a security clearance from 2004 to 2014. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in \n1999 and a master\u2019s degree in 2007. He is married with two children. (Tr. at 17-18, 28-\n30, 35; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant lives in a state where recreational marijuana possession and use do \nnot violate state law. Cultivation and sale of marijuana are also not against state law but \nare strictly regulated. After he was laid off in 2014, Applicant worked in a business \nowned by his father. They were approached by a marijuana grower about using their \nproduct in the business. They decided their existing product was not right for the \ncannabis industry, but they saw opportunities in that field. They developed software and \nhardware products that enabled marijuana growers to better comply with the state\u2019s \nregulations. They took their company public, with Applicant and his father the major \nshareholders. Applicant was also a senior executive in the company. (Tr. at 17-22, 30-\n34; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3; AE B, C, G) \nApplicant\u2019s company sold their products to the growers, but his company\u2019s \nowners and employees never came in contact with marijuana. They had to register with \nthe state as a cannabis company. Cannabis growers, even ones licensed by a state, are \nconsidered illegal companies by the federal government and the IRS. Applicant\u2019s \ncompany is not treated by the IRS or the federal government as an illegal company. (Tr. \nat 22-23, 32-33; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1-3; AE B, C, G) \nApplicant never used illegal drugs of any kind before his business became \ninvolved in the cannabis industry. He became more aware of its properties and how \nmany view it as having medicinal properties. He did not intend to return to working in a \njob that required a security clearance, and he started using marijuana edibles in about \n2017. The marijuana was obtained from state-regulated dispensaries. He used \nmarijuana recreationally and to help him sleep about four times a year until August \n2022, which is the last time he used any illegal drug. (Tr. at 18, 24-25, 36-37; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant saw an opportunity to return to work for the same defense contractor \nhe worked for until 2014. He submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions \n(SF-86) in December 2022. He reported his use of marijuana. He indicated he did not \nintend to use marijuana in the future so that he \u201ccan get and keep a security clearance.\u201d \nHe also reported his company\u2019s involvement in the marijuana business. He wrote: \u201cAt \nthis time and upon hire, I will stop my daily activities and tasks with the company. \nHowever, I am a shareholder in the company. Additionally, my father is the CEO.\u201d He \nfully discussed his marijuana use and his company\u2019s business during his background \ninterview in February 2023. (Tr. at 23-26, 38; GE 1, 2; AE A) \nApplicant terminated his position with his former company in December 2022. He \nsold his shares in the company to his father and uncle in July 2023 for $500.

(Tr. at 23-26, 34-35, 38; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; AE E, \nH) \nApplicant submitted documents and letters attesting to his excellent job \nperformance and strong moral character. He is praised for his judgment, reliability, \ndedication, and trustworthiness. (AE A, D, F) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nOn October 25, 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (the Security Executive \nAgent (SecEA)) issued DNI Memorandum ES 2014-00674, \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws \nProhibiting Marijuana Use,\u201d which states: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines . . . . An individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the \nuse, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations. As always, adjudicative authorities are \nexpected to evaluate claimed or developed use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. The adjudicative authority \nmust determine if the use of, or involvement with, marijuana raises \nquestions about the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nwillingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, including federal \nlaws, when making eligibility decisions of persons proposed for, or \noccupying, sensitive national security positions. \nOn December 21, 2021, the SecEA promulgated clarifying guidance concerning \nmarijuana-related issues in security clearance adjudications (Security Executive Agent \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nClarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for Agencies Conducting Adjudications of \nPersons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold \na Sensitive Position). It states in pertinent part: \n[Federal] agencies are instructed that prior recreational marijuana use by \nan individual may be relevant to adjudications but not determinative. The \nSecEA has provided direction in [the adjudicative guidelines] to agencies \nthat requires them to use a \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d This requires \nadjudicators to carefully weigh a number of variables in an individual\u2019s life \nto determine whether that individual\u2019s behavior raises a security concern, \nif at all, and whether that concern has been mitigated such that the \nindividual may now receive a favorable adjudicative determination. \nRelevant mitigations include, but are not limited to, frequency of use and \nwhether the individual can demonstrate that future use is unlikely to recur, \nincluding by signing an attestation or other such appropriate mitigation. \nAdditionally, in light of the long-standing federal law and policy prohibiting \nillegal drug use while occupying a sensitive position or holding a security \nclearance, agencies are encouraged to advise prospective national \nsecurity workforce employees that they should refrain from any future \nmarijuana use upon initiation of the national security vetting process, \nwhich commences once the individual signs the certification contained in \nthe Standard Form 86 (SF-86), Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions.  \n      \n \n        \n \n        \n*\n*\n* \nFinally, with regard to the topic of investments, agencies should note that \nan adjudicative determination for an individual\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information or eligibility to hold a sensitive position may be \nimpacted negatively should that individual knowingly and directly invest in \nstocks or business ventures that specifically pertain to marijuana growers \nand retailers while the cultivation and distribution of marijuana remains \nillegal under the Controlled Substances Act. Under [the adjudicative \nguidelines\u2019] guidance for personal conduct (Reference B, Guideline E), a \ndecision to invest in an activity, including a marijuana-related business, \nwhich the individual knows violates federal law could reflect questionable \njudgment and an unwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThat is, it is appropriate for adjudicative personnel to consider whether an \nindividual is knowingly facilitating violations of the Controlled Substances \nAct by engaging in such investments. On the other hand, if the marijuana-\nrelated investment is not direct, such as an investment in a diversified \nmutual fund that is publicly-traded on a United States exchange, \nadjudicators should presume that individual did not knowingly invest in a \nmarijuana-related business; thus, the indirect investment should not be \nconsidered relevant to adjudications. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn some instances, the investment itself may be illegal, which is also \nrelevant to [the adjudicative guidelines\u2019] guidance for criminal conduct \n(Reference B, Guideline J), which by its very nature calls into question an \nindividual\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. However, under the whole-person concept, any mitigating \nfactors should be considered. For example, if an individual holds direct \nstock investments pertaining to marijuana growers and retailers, \ndivestment of such activity or disassociation of such activity should be \nconsidered a mitigating factor when rendering an adjudicative decision. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant possessed and used marijuana. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) are applicable. \nThe question of whether his involvement with his company generates any drug \ninvolvement disqualifying conditions is more difficult. His company provided hardware \nand software products to the cannabis industry. His company and its employees never \ndirectly handled or possessed marijuana, but it facilitated its distribution in a state where \nthe cannabis industry was legal under state law, but heavily regulated and illegal under \nfederal law. I considered the tax case law provided by Applicant. While the federal \ngovernment would never seek to prosecute Applicant, his company, or any of its \nemployees, I find that they technically violated federal law as a principal (aider and \nabettor, accomplice, accessory, co-conspirator). AG \u00b6 25(c) is applicable. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n6 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant lives in a state where recreational marijuana possession and use do \nnot violate state law. Cultivation and sale of marijuana are also not against state law but \nare strictly regulated. He and his father developed software and hardware products that \nenabled marijuana growers to better comply with the state\u2019s regulations. His former \ncompany was never directly involved with the marijuana product. \nApplicant was never a marijuana user, but through his former company, he \nbecame more aware of its properties and how many view it as having medicinal \nproperties. He started using marijuana edibles obtained from state-regulated \ndispensaries in about 2017. He used marijuana recreationally and to help him sleep \nabout four times a year until August 2022, which is the last time he used any illegal \ndrug. \nApplicant realized that marijuana use and involvement in the cannabis industry \nwere inconsistent with holding a security clearance. He terminated his position with his \nformer company in December 2022, and he sold his shares in the company in July \n2023. He signed a statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for \nrevocation of national security eligibility. \nI conclude that Applicant\u2019s conduct no longer casts doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that he has abstained from illegal drug \ninvolvement for an appropriate period, and that illegal drug involvement is unlikely to \nrecur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b) are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. I also considered \nApplicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer, Applicant denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.g with explanations. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 31 years old. He attended college part time from August 2012 through December 2016. He took additional college courses online from June 2020 through September 2022. In both instances, he did not earn a degree. He has been employed as a configuration analyst by a defense contractor since September 2022 and is applying for his first security clearance.

After a \nthorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \nApplicant is 31 years old. He attended college part time from August 2012 \nthrough December 2016. He took additional college courses online from June 2020 \nthrough September 2022. In both instances, he did not earn a degree. He has been \nemployed as a configuration analyst by a defense contractor since September 2022 and \nis applying for his first security clearance. (GX 1-2; Tr. 9, 19-20, 38-39) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant was delinquent on seven federal student loans, \ntotaling approximately $39,263. In his Answer, Applicant denied the allegations, but \nacknowledged that he took out the student loans to support his studies through \nDecember 2016. The SOR allegations are confirmed by his October 2022 and June \n2023 credit reports. (Answer; GX 1-4) \nFrom April 2012 through December 2018, Applicant worked as a personal \nelectronics sales representative and his income was highly dependent on commissions. \nHe described his earnings during that period as \u201cnot great pay.\u201d Beginning in 2017, his \nexpenses increased because he moved out of his parents\u2019 home and he did a lot of \n\u201cgrowing up\u201d trying to pay his bills and maintain a budget. He testified that he started \nmaking payments on his student loans during this period, but quickly struggled \nfinancially. (GX 1-2; Tr. 21-22, 41, 71-73) \nApplicant sought out a higher-paying job and, in June 2018, he was hired by a \nbank to work full time assisting customers with various loan and credit applications. He \nestimated that, with bonuses, he earned about $49,000 annually in this position. He \nbegan to resolve other, unspecified debts. (GX 1-2; Tr. 24-26) \nIn late 2018, Applicant was advised by the U.S. Department of Education \n(DOE)\u2019s Default Resolution Group that his student loans had been placed in default \nstatus. In response, he reached an agreement with the DOE to rehabilitate the loans \nwhich would then afford him an opportunity to apply for a lower monthly payment.

He did not provide documentation regarding this rehabilitation plan. \n(Tr. 22-25, 42-44, 52-54) \nInstead, Applicant provided bank statements corroborating that he made monthly \npayments to the DOE of $503 from December 2018 through March 2019. He then made \na $1,000 payment to the DOE in June 2019 and made monthly payments of $550 from \nAugust through October 2019. He made an additional $500 payment to the DOE in \nFebruary 2020. He testified that he then submitted an application to complete the \nrehabilitation process on his student loans. However, he later learned that the DOE \neither did not receive or never processed the application. Therefore, his student loans \nremained in default status. Once he realized that his DOE account had not been \nrehabilitated, he considered consolidating the student loans with another creditor. \nHowever, he did not pursue that option due to the higher interest rate on the \nconsolidated loan, which would have increased his overall repayment obligation. At the \nhearing, he acknowledged that he could have done more to follow through with his \nefforts to rehabilitate his DOE account. (AX D, F-G; Tr. 23-27, 44-52, 80-81) \nIn March 2020, with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, payments on federal \nstudent loans were paused as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic \nSecurity Act (CARES Act). The pause included several relief measures for eligible \nstudent loans such as a suspension of loan payments; a 0% interest rate; and \nsuspension of collection efforts on defaulted loans. Payments resumed in October 2023. \nSee Federal Student Aid (FSA) website, https://studentaid.gov/announcements-\nevents/covid-19/. \nOnce payments were paused under the CARES Act, Applicant debated whether \nto keep making the $500 payment on his student loans or accept the CARES Act \npause. He opted to stop paying on his loans. With various types of federal action and \nthe possible forgiveness of student loans being considered, Applicant figured \u201cit was \nkind of all up in the air,\u201d so he waited to see what would happen. (Answer; Tr. 30-35) \nMeanwhile, from his time at the bank, Applicant assisted many customers in \nusing their home equity to pay off their other bills including student loans. He prioritized \npurchasing a home as an investment he could use to potentially resolve his student \nloans once the CARES Act pause was lifted. He applied $14,000 from funds he earned \nfrom a stock market investment to buy a $300,000 house in 2020. (Tr. 25-30; 78-83) \nApplicant considered but did not immediately apply for the \u201cFresh Start\u201d program \nannounced by the DOE in April 2022, whereby qualified borrowers with student loans in \ndefault could bring their loans current with the establishment of a new payment plan. \nSee Federal Student Aid (FSA) website, https://studentaid.gov/announcements-\nevents/default-fresh-start.

In early 2023, \nApplicant applied for the Fresh Start Program. In May 2023, upon being approved for \nthe Fresh Start Program, his DOE account was rehabilitated and all seven of his student \nloans were transferred to EdFinancial for servicing. He testified \u201cI set myself up on a \nstudent repayment program the right way this time, especially now since I have enough \nto financially cover everything.\u201d (AX A, C, G, J; Tr. 32-40, 78-80) \nIn July 2023, as he was financial able to resume payments, Applicant submitted \nan application to EdFinancial for an income-driven repayment plan (IDR) to reduce his \nmonthly payment. As of August 2023, the principle balance of his EdFinancial account \nwas $38,743, and with interest, the total to be repaid was $51,822. EdFinancial \napproved his IDR, which established that he would pay $381 per month, beginning in \nOctober 2023. He corroborated that, once the CARES Act pause was lifted, he made \ntimely payments to EdFinancial, pursuant to the IDR, in October, November and \nDecember 2023; and that all seven alleged student loans are no longer in delinquent \nstatus. (AX A-B, E, G; Tr. 33-34, 76-78, 97) \nIn order to maintain payments going forward, Applicant testified that he created a \ndesignated direct deposit account where a portion of his salary is deposited to pay his \nstudent loans. He submitted a budget showing that he is able to meet his current \nmonthly expenses, including his student loans, with a small net remainder. He maintains \na retirement account with his employer and has no other delinquent accounts. He \nintends to continue managing his budget and paying his student loans. (AX H-I; \nTr. 30-37, 67-69; 85-90) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \n\u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThe financial security concern is broader than the possibility that an individual \nmight knowingly compromise classified information to raise money.

May 1, 2012) \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for financial considerations under \nAG \u00b6 19 and the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nFrom August 2012 through December 2016, Applicant borrowed about $38,743 \nfrom the DOE to attend college. Shortly after his student loan payments became due in \n2017, they were placed into delinquent status where they remained into 2023. The \nabove disqualifying conditions apply. \nThere are three pertinent conditions in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties:  \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nBeginning in 2017, as Applicant struggled financially after moving out of his \nparents\u2019 house and while working a low-paying job, he was unable to make the required \nmonthly payments on his student loans, which eventually led them to be placed in \ndefault status. After obtaining a new job with increased pay in 2018, he made \ninconsistent payments to the DOE through February 2020, in an attempt to rehabilitate \nhis student loans. Despite those payments, his student loans remained in default when \nthe CARES Act pause began in March 2020. \nWhile Applicant chose to not make payments on his student loans during the \nCARES Act pause, he remained attentive to the various types of federal action on \nstudent loans that were being considered. After he obtained his current position in \nSeptember 2022, which increased his pay, he applied for the DOE\u2019s Fresh Start \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \nProgram. In May 2023, he applied for an IDR to keep his payments manageable. He \nimmediately began making timely payments once the CARES Act pause on student \nloan payments was lifted in October 2023. \nOver the last eight years, Applicant described his own maturation in managing \nhis income and monthly expenditures. He purchased a home, brought his student loans \ninto good standing, and maintained a manageable budget that allows him to save some \nfunds each month and build his retirement. He also maintains a dedicated direct-deposit \naccount to manage his future student loan payments. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues occurred under circumstances that are unlikely to \nrecur, and they no longer cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment. He has established, and is adhering to, a payment plan to address his \nstudent loan obligations. All of the above mitigating conditions are applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nFrom late 2018 through February 2020, Applicant made multiple payments in an \neffort to rehabilitate his student loans. During the CARES Act pause in student loan \npayments that began in 2020, he researched various student loan repayment options \nand took steps to establish a payment plan that he could afford. He committed to \nmaintaining a budget and was able to buy a house. Applicant established a meaningful \ntrack record of payments toward his student loans, which are in good standing. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nHaving had the opportunity to observe Applicant's demeanor during his hearing, I \nfound his testimony credible and candid.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. One condition is established: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition). \nAppellant used marijuana over a period of about 30 years, in part pursuant to a \nmedical prescription. Therefore, AG \u00b6 25 (a) is established. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nApplicant ceased his use of marijuana more than year prior to his hearing, and \nbefore he started working for his current employer in the defense industry. He now \ntreats his snowboarding-injury pain with Ibuprofen. Drug Involvement and Substance \nMisuse is found for Applicant. \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. One is potentially applicable in this case: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired \nApplicant failed to file his Federal and state income tax returns for tax years \n2015~2022. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant has now filed all of his income tax returns. He was relying on \nmisinformation and a misconception that, as he withheld more than enough monies \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfrom his earnings, he did not have to file. After being informed of his filing requirements, \nregardless of his withholdings, Applicant filed all of his tax returns. He now understands \nand intends to meet his obligation to do so in the future. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has \nbeen established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAG \u00b6 2(b) requires each case must be judged on its own merits. Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. I considered the potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant is respected in the workplace as being truthful and trustworthy, as \ntestified to by his facility security officer and by a co-worker. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated \nthe security concerns arising from his drug involvement and substance abuse, and \nfinancial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a~2.c: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations in the SOR, with explanations. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 33-year-old systems engineer employed by a defense contractor since April 2015. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in December 2013. He has lived with a cohabitant, whom he married in September 2024, since July 2018. He has no children. He received a security clearance in August 2015. Applicant began consuming alcohol every month or two in the summer of 2008 and fall of 2009, while he was in high school. In college, he drank about once a week, consuming one to eight drinks per occasion at parties. He was arrested for public intoxication in 2012, but no charges were filed, and he was released to the custody of his father.

His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 33-year-old systems engineer employed by a defense contractor \nsince April 2015. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in December 2013. He has lived with \na cohabitant, whom he married in September 2024, since July 2018. He has no children. \nHe received a security clearance in August 2015. \nApplicant began consuming alcohol every month or two in the summer of 2008 \nand fall of 2009, while he was in high school. In college, he drank about once a week, \nconsuming one to eight drinks per occasion at parties. He was arrested for public \nintoxication in 2012, but no charges were filed, and he was released to the custody of his \nfather.

He \nused ecstasy five to ten times between June 2010 to January 2019. He used ketamine \nonce or twice a year between May 2016 and January 2018. \nIn January 2018, Applicant made an appointment with his primary care physician \nbecause of his difficulty in dealing with anxiety, depression, attention deficit hyperactivity \ndisorder (ADHD), and difficulty sleeping. He received a prescription for Adderall. His \nprimary care physician suggested that he see a psychiatrist. He met with a psychiatrist in \nFebruary 2018, and he informed the psychiatrist of his struggle with anxiety, depression, \nand ADHD. The psychiatrist put him on a prescription regimen for Lexapro and stopped \nthe prescription for Adderall. Applicant does not believe that the Lexapro was effective, \npossibly because the dosage was too low. (Tr. 48-50) \nIn July 2019, Applicant met with a psychologist for cognitive behavior therapy \n(CBT). Applicant testified that at this point he was \u201cjust too broken\u201d to participate in therapy \nsessions. Instead, he started using cocaine two or three times a week. (Tr 54) \nApplicant received a written warning from his employer in September 2019 for \ntardiness, erratic work hours, and unusual behavior. He admitted during a meeting with \nhis supervisors that he had consumed alcohol during his lunch hour on September 19, \n2019, and had done so on several previous occasions. Within a few days after he received \nthe written warning, he failed a urinalysis test for marijuana and cocaine. He then took a \nleave of absence for inpatient and outpatient treatment for drug abuse. He was treated at \na detoxification and recovery services facility from October 5 to October 21, 2019, and he \ncompleted the treatment program. He was diagnosed with an alcohol use disorder. He \nwas transferred to another facility for outpatient counseling and treatment until November \n15, 2019, when he completed this program and returned to work. (GX 1 at 34-44; GX 3) \nApplicant sought and received individual therapy from October 2019 to March \n2021. He enrolled in group therapy from September 2021 to November 2022, followed by \nindividual therapy. (Answer at \u00a7 1.3.2.2.2.1) He has been receiving psychotherapy under \nthe care of a licensed psychologist since July 2023 for polysubstance use and anxiety \nsymptomatology. The psychologist believes that his cocaine and cannabis use is in \nsustained remission, and his alcohol use is continued but controlled. (GX 3, attachments \nto interrogatories) He has met with a psychiatrist regularly from June 2021 to the present. \n(Answer at AX A \u00a7 1.3.2.2.14 and AX B at \u00a7 1.3.2.2.1.20) As of the date of the hearing, \nhe had not used marijuana, cocaine, ecstasy, or ketamine for about five years. (AX B at \n2) \nApplicant began attending three Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings per week \nwhile he was in the group therapy program. He continued his AA participation until the \nmeetings were cancelled in March 2020 due to COVID-19. (Tr. 60) He tried virtual \nmeetings but found that they were less effective, and his alcohol consumption increased. \nIn April 2020, he was consuming between three to four drinks per session, one to three \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntimes and week.

(Tr. 63) \nIn March 2021, Applicant\u2019s anxiety level started to increase as the pace of his work \nincreased. By May 2021, he was drinking about five times a week and consuming four or \nfive drinks per occasion. In June 2021, he met with a psychiatrist that he was continuing \nto see as of the date of the hearing. He told the psychiatrist that he had not been \nprescribed any medication for his ADHD since October 2019 and that his stress level was \nincreasing. The psychiatrist renewed his Adderall prescription. By August 2021, his \ndrinking had decreased to one or two times a week, consuming two to four drinks per \nsession. (Tr. 69) By the time of his interview with a security investigator in November \n2021, he was drinking one or two times a week, consuming three drinks per session. (Tr. \n70) He testified that his current pattern is to drink one to three times a week, consuming \none to three drinks per occasion. (Tr. 86) \nIn November 2022, Applicant began individual psychotherapy and formed a good \nrelationship with a psychotherapist. When this psychotherapist moved to another state, \nhe continued with a second psychotherapist, and his alcohol consumption during August \n2023 to February 2024 was reduced to drinking two or three times a week and consuming \none to four drinks per occasion. At this point, Applicant believed his anxiety was under \ncontrol. (Tr. 73-74) \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor during 2018 through 2023, who has known him since 2015, \ntestified that Applicant\u2019s performance for most of his career was excellent until about \nSeptember 2019, when his performance declined. After Applicant returned from medical \nleave in November 2019, he looked better and healthier, and his performance returned \nto his previous level. He believes that Applicant is now a trustworthy person and can be \ntrusted to safeguard classified information. (Tr. 21-24) \nA long-time friend of Applicant who is employed by another defense contractor \ntestified that he noticed that Applicant\u2019s demeanor began to change in the mid to late 20s, \nwhen he became more withdrawn and cynical. He testified that Applicant\u2019s demeanor has \nnow returned to being more responsible, accountable, and able to function on a day-to-\nday basis. He believes that Applicant has returned to being a trustworthy person with the \nability to safeguard classified information. (Tr.29-34) \nBefore Applicant received the letter of warning in September 2019, he was \nconsistently recognized for outstanding performance. (AX C at 8-10.) Since his return to \nduty, he has resumed his exceptional performance. His most recent achievement award \nwas on September 9, 2024. (AX C at 1-7) \nApplicant testified that he still associates with friends that he has known for over \n15 years who continue to use illegal drugs. He understands that associating with drug-\nusing friends is an issue, but that it is difficult to \u201ccast them aside\u201d because of their long-\nterm friendship and support.

(AX D at 1-8) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan at 531. Substantial \nevidence is \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d See ISCR \nCase No. 17-04166 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 21, 2019) It is \u201cless than the weight of the \nevidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence \ndoes not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d \nConsolo v.

ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about \nApril 2007 to September 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); used cocaine with varying frequency from \nabout October 2009 to October 2019 (SOR 1.b); used ecstasy with varying frequency \nfrom about June 2010 to January 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); used ketamine with varying \nfrequency from about May 2016 to January 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.e); and that he used all these \ndrugs while having access to classified information. It also alleges that he tested positive \nof marijuana in September 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Applicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence \nsubmitted at the hearing establish SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e. \n\u00b6 \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing, including his \ndiagnosis and treatment for polysubstance abuse, establish the following disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse (see above definition);  \nAG \u00b6 25(c): illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia; and \nAG \u00b6 25(d): diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health \nprofessional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed \nclinical social worker) of substance abuse disorder. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) is established.

All the allegations are established by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing. \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \u201cExcessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control \nimpulses and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d \nThe evidence establishes the following disqualifying conditions: \nAG \u00b6 22(b): alcohol-related incidents at work, such as reporting for work or \nduty in an intoxicated or impaired condition, drinking on the job, or \njeopardizing the welfare and safety of others, regardless of whether the \nindividual is diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge2 consumption of alcohol to the point of \nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with \nalcohol use disorder; and \nAG \u00b6 22(d): diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health \nprofessional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed \nclinical social worker) of alcohol use disorder. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nor does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment;  \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive \nalcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; \n2 The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism defines \u201cbinge drinking\u201d as \u201ca pattern of drinking \nthat brings a person\u2019s blood alcohol concentration (BAC) to 0.08 percent or above,\u201d which typically occurs \nwhen a man has five or more drinks or a woman has four or more drinks within a two-hour period.

SOR \u00b6 3.b alleges that Applicant falsified his SCA on May 5, 2015, by \nfailing to disclose the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d. \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nAt the hearing, Applicant admitted that he falsified his SCA. He testified that he \nwas young and na\u00efve and that he did not understand the seriousness of falsifying an SCA. \nHe testified that he had just started his \u201cdream job\u201d a monthly earlier and he was afraid \nthat he would lose the job if he was unable to obtain a security clearance. (Tr. 89) \nThe following disqualifying conditions are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions \nand the evidence submitted at the hearing: \nAG \u00b616(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress \nby a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes . . . :engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate \nthe stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \nAG \u00b6 17(e): the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \nAG \u00b6 17(a) is not established. Applicant made no effort to correct his falsification \nof his 2015 SCA until he was confronted with it during the current adjudicatory process. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is established for Applicant\u2019s falsification of his SCA. Applicant was \ncandid in his 2021 SCA and during the adjudicatory process following the more recent \nSCA. He was candid at the hearing. I conclude that his falsification of the 2015 SCA is \nmitigated by the passage of time. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(e) are established for the reasons set out in the above \ndiscussion of Guidelines H and G. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H, G, and E in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered his \nlong service as an employee of a defense contractor while holding a security clearance. \nHe was candid, sincere, and credible at the hearing. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guidelines H, G, and E and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns \nraised by his drug involvement, his alcohol consumption, and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.d: \n \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.b:  \nFor Applicant \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

While she has repeatedly \nclaimed she enrolled in a debt-resolution program, she has provided no documentary \nproof of any steps taken to validate her disputes with any of the SOR-listed creditors. \nNor is there any documentary proof in the record of her claimed retainer of a debt-\nresolution firm, or whether she has made timely payments in accordance with any \nsigned agreement. \nPolicies \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance [public trust position}.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has \nthe authority to control access to information bearing on national security and to \ndetermine whether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such \ninformation.\u201d Id. at 527. Eligibility for access to classified information [privacy \ninformation] may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.

These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information [privacy information]. These guidelines include conditions \nthat could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if \nany, and all of the conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. These \nguidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security clearance \n[eligibility to hold a public trust position] should be granted, continued, or denied. \nAlthough, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive reliance on the \nenumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a \ndecision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. . . .

This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information [and implicitly \nprivacy information]. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation (and implicitly misuse of privacy information). Clearance decisions must be \n\u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 \n(Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access privacy information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. 518, at 531 \n(1988).  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   \nSee v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The \nguidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any \nof the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness suitability. See ISCR \nCase No. 95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance\u201d and implicitly his or her trustworthiness eligibility. ISCR Case No. 01-20700 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never \nshifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd.

See 5200.02, \n\u00b6 4.1a(3)(c)    \nDefinitions for critical-sensitive and non-critical sensitive positions provided in \n5200.02, \u00b6 4.1a(3)(c) contain descriptions similar to those used to define ADP I and II \npositions under DoD Regulation 5200.2-R. (32 C.F.R. \u00a7 154.13 and Part 154, App. J) \nADP positions are broken down as follows in C.F.R. \u00a7 154.13 and Part 154, App. J): \nADP I (critical-sensitive positions covering the direction, design, and planning of \ncomputer systems) and ADP II (non-critical-sensitive positions covering the design, \noperation, and maintenance of computer systems).

By virtue of the implied retention of ADP \ndefinitions in DoD Manual 5200.02, ADP cases continue to be covered by the process \nafforded by DoD 5220.6. \nFinancial concerns \nApplicant\u2019s accumulated delinquent dets warrant the application of two of the \ndisqualifying conditions (DC) of the financial consideration guidelines. DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \ninability to satisfy debts\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; apply \nto Applicant\u2019s situation. \nApplicant\u2019s admitted debt delinquencies require no independent proof to \nsubstantiate them. See Directive 5220.6 at E3.1.1.14; McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 262 \n(6th  ed. 2006). Her admitted debt delinquencies are fully documented and create \njudgment issues over the management of her finances. See ISCR Case No. 03-01059 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004).  \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect privacy information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access and protect privacy information. While the principal \nconcern of a public trust position holder is the holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is \nvulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases \ninvolving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \n6 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking eligibility to hold a public \ntrust position.

See ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, \n2019) \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person assessment of Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness eligibility requires \nconsideration of whether her history of accumulated delinquent accounts is fully \ncompatible with minimum standards for holding a public trust position. While Applicant is \nentitled to credit for her work in the defense health industry and for the devotion she has \nshown for her multiple ill family members, her efforts are not enough at this time to \novercome her repeated failures or inability to address her debts in a timely way. Overall \ntrustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment have not been established. \nBased on a consideration of all of the facts and circumstances considered in this \ncase, it is too soon to make safe predictions that Applicant will be able to undertake \nreasoned, good-faith efforts to mitigate the Government\u2019s financial concerns within the \nforeseeable future. More time is needed for her to establish the requisite levels of \nstability with her finances to establish her overall eligibility for holding a public trust \nposition. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v.

His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. Applicant is 50 years old. He has been married for 27 years, and he has an adult son and a 12-year-old son. He was on active duty in the U.S. Army from 1992 to 1995. He went back on active duty in June 1997 through June 2000. He served one year in Bosnia.

On May 16, 2023, the Defense Counterintelligence \nand Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudication Services (CAS) issued a \nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \nOn May 19, 2023, Applicant provided a response to the SOR, and he requested a \nhearing. On July 28, 2023, the case was assigned to me. On October 12, 2023, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing, setting the \nhearing for November 15, 2023.

I held the record open until December 1, 2023, in the event either party wanted \nto supplement the record with additional documentation. Applicant provided an e-mail \ncommunication after his hearing, which I marked as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A, and which \nI admitted without objection. On November 22, 2023, DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript. The record closed on December 2, 2023.   \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted all five allegations of delinquent debts \ntotaling approximately $21,000. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e.) His admissions are accepted \nas findings of fact. \nApplicant is 50 years old. He has been married for 27 years, and he has an adult \nson and a 12-year-old son. He was on active duty in the U.S. Army from 1992 to 1995. \nHe went back on active duty in June 1997 through June 2000. He served one year in \nBosnia. After his honorable discharge in June 2000 at the rank of sergeant (E-5), he \nserved one year in the Army National Guard while he was enrolled in college. In August \n2001, he earned an associate degree in automotive technology. (GE 1; Tr. 15-18, 22) \nSince May 2022, Applicant has been employed by a government contractor as a \ntechnical support analyst. He makes approximately $48,000 annually. His wife does not \ncurrently work. He is rated as 50% disabled by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). \nHis monthly VA disability pay is approximately $1,215. (Tr. 17-22, 39-40; GE 3) \nFinancial Considerations \nThe SOR alleges five delinquent debts, and the record establishes the status of \nApplicant\u2019s accounts as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a credit card debt placed for collection for $4,998. Applicant \nbelieves this account became delinquent in 2016. Since it became delinquent, he has not \nmade any payments or communicated with the creditor about this debt. In 2018, he \ncontacted a bankruptcy attorney to assist him with his outstanding financial obligations. \nApplicant made payments to the attorney for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy filing fee. In May \n2023, Applicant informed the attorney\u2019s secretary that he may want to pursue a Chapter \n13 bankruptcy instead. Since that time, he has had no further communications with the \nattorney. After the hearing, Applicant sent an email stating he had contacted the attorney \nagain and discovered the law office was permanently closed. Applicant will attempt to \nresolve his delinquent debts with another bankruptcy attorney. This debt is unresolved. \n(Tr. 24-25; AE A; GE 3) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges a credit card debt placed for collection for $4,672. Applicant \nbelieves this account became delinquent in 2016. Since it became delinquent, he has not \nmade any payments or communicated with the creditor about this debt.

Since it became delinquent, he has not \nmade any payments or communicated with the creditor about this debt. He included this \ndebt in his 2018 communications with the bankruptcy attorney who is no longer in \nbusiness. This debt is unresolved. (Tr. 26; AE A; GE 3) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges a credit card debt placed for collection for $3,972. Applicant \nbelieves this account became delinquent in 2016. Since it became delinquent, he has not \nmade any payments or communicated with the creditor about this debt. He included this \ndebt in his 2018 communications with the aforementioned bankruptcy attorney. This debt \nis unresolved. (Tr. 26-27; AE A; GE 3) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges a credit card debt placed for collection for $2,859. Applicant \nbelieves this account became delinquent in 2016. Since it became delinquent, he has not \nmade any payments or communicated with the creditor about this debt. He included this \ndebt in his 2018 communications with the bankruptcy attorney. This debt is unresolved. \n(Tr. 26-27; AE A; GE 3) \nApplicant stated he had contacted the bankruptcy attorney in 2018 because his \nwife had lost her job in 2015, she attempted suicide, and in addition to the mounting credit \ncard debts, they accumulated a lot of medical bills for her treatment. He could not keep \nup with the mounting debt. The filing fee for the Chapter 7 bankruptcy was $1,700, and \nApplicant made payments to the attorney whenever he was able. The plan was to file \nbankruptcy in 2021, but due to COVID-19 everything was placed on hold. Applicant \nemailed the attorney a couple times and left some voice mail messages over the years, \nbut he never heard back from him. In May 2023, the attorney\u2019s secretary called stating \nthat the attorney needed to know what Applicant wanted to do. Applicant told the secretary \nthat he would like to look at other options because his financial situation had improved. \nHe also told the secretary he was going to pay off some of his debts and that he may \nprefer filing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy instead. The secretary told Applicant they would \nwork on a plan and be in touch with him soon. Applicant has not had any further \ncommunications with the attorney or legal secretary since May 2023. (Tr. 27-38) \nApplicant admitted that during the last two years he had accumulated \napproximately $6,000 in credit card debt, but he emphasized that the accounts were not \ndelinquent. He stated that he would not include this recent accumulation of credit card \ndebt in his anticipated bankruptcy filing. He has never participated in a consumer financial \ncounseling program. (Tr. 36-37, 40) \nApplicant responded to a financial interrogatory in March 2023. He provided a \npersonal financial statement (PFS) which showed his monthly net income, to include his \nVA disability pay, was $4,385. After deducting his monthly expenses and financial \nobligations, he was left with a monthly remainder of $878.

There is no evidence that Applicant is taking action to \nresolve the five delinquent accounts listed in the SOR. (GE 3) \nPolicies \nA memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense dated November 19, 2004, \ntreats public trust positions as sensitive positions, and it entitles applicants to the \nprocedural protections in the Directive before any final unfavorable determination may be \nmade. The standard set out in the adjudicative guidelines for assignment to sensitive \nduties is that the person\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that assigning \nthe person to sensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial \nand commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d The Government must present \nsubstantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the \nGovernment establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial evidence, the burden \nshifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. An applicant has \nthe burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts \nto the Government. An applicant has the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly \nconsistent with national security to grant or continue eligibility for access to sensitive \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the trustworthiness concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nConditions that may raise financial considerations trustworthiness concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) \nrequiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \nThe following financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant attributed his financial delinquencies to his wife\u2019s loss of employment in \n2015, mounting credit card debt, and the unexpected medical bills associated with her \ntreatment after a suicide attempt. Notwithstanding these events that impacted his \nfinances, Applicant must demonstrate that he acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nHe admitted that he intended to file bankruptcy, but as of the date of the hearing, he had \nnot had contact with the attorney\u2019s office since May of 2023. After the hearing, when \nApplicant called the law office, he discovered that it had permanently closed. \nApplicant\u2019s debts became delinquent in 2016. He has not made any payments or \ninitiated communication with any of his delinquent creditors. He has not demonstrated \nthat he acted responsibly to address his financial delinquencies. There are not clear \nindications that the debts are being resolved or that his finances are under control.

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant eligibility for a \npublic trust position \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under \nGuideline F are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. Applicant did not \nprovide any evidence of payments, payment plans, or other actions to resolve the five \ndelinquent debts alleged in the SOR. His actions show a lack of financial responsibility \nand good judgment and raise unmitigated questions about Applicant\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect sensitive information. \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to be eligible for a \nposition of trust. The determination of an individual\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a \ntrustworthiness position is not a once in a lifetime occurrence, but is based on applying \nthe factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to the evidence presented. Under his current \ncircumstances, a position of trust is not warranted. In the future, he may well demonstrate \npersuasive evidence of his trustworthiness. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in the Directive, and the AGs, to the \nfacts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. I conclude that financial \nconsideration concerns are not mitigated. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \npublic trust position.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.f and 1.g. She denied SOR allegations 1.c and 1.e and provided explanations. Her admissions are incorporated into my findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 32 years old. She divorced her first husband in May 2017 and married her current husband in October 2020. She has one teenage child and three teenage stepchildren. She completed an associate degree in 2012 and has been with her current employer as a long-haul truck driver since November 2023. She has not previously held a security clearance. (GX 1-2; Tr. 22-25) In 2016, Applicant made a career change from retail employment, obtained a Class B commercial driver\u2019s license (CDL) and began working seasonally for a city government in State A. She hoped that the work would manifest into full-time employment. However, that never occurred and in March 2019, she moved to State B to be closer to family. She continued to struggle to find steady employment in State B, particularly while taking on primary childcare responsibilities for her own child and her soon-to-be husband\u2019s three children. (GX 1-2; Tr. 37-40) Applicant\u2019s husband is a truck driver and holds a Class A CDL. By 2020, Applicant was assisting her husband with the paperwork necessary for his work.

DOHA received the hearing transcript \n(Tr.) on June 17, 2024. The record closed on June 21, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, 1.f \nand 1.g. She denied SOR allegations 1.c and 1.e and provided explanations. Her \nadmissions are incorporated into my findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 32 years old. She divorced her first husband in May 2017 and married \nher current husband in October 2020. She has one teenage child and three teenage \nstepchildren. She completed an associate degree in 2012 and has been with her current \nemployer as a long-haul truck driver since November 2023. She has not previously held \na security clearance. (GX 1-2; Tr. 22-25) \nIn 2016, Applicant made a career change from retail employment, obtained a Class \nB commercial driver\u2019s license (CDL) and began working seasonally for a city government \nin State A. She hoped that the work would manifest into full-time employment. However, \nthat never occurred and in March 2019, she moved to State B to be closer to family. She \ncontinued to struggle to find steady employment in State B, particularly while taking on \nprimary childcare responsibilities for her own child and her soon-to-be husband\u2019s three \nchildren. (GX 1-2; Tr. 37-40) \nApplicant\u2019s husband is a truck driver and holds a Class A CDL. By 2020, Applicant \nwas assisting her husband with the paperwork necessary for his work. In June 2020, they \nstarted their own transportation company and leased two trucks. Applicant cashed out a \nsmall pension from her city government work and used personal funds to help start the \nbusiness. Her husband drove one truck and they planned to hire another driver to run the \nsecond truck. (GX 1-2; Tr. 40-48) \nFor the first year, the business ran well. Applicant \u201cdid everything but drive\u201d and \ntook online training on how to manage the financial books. (Tr. 42) At its strongest, she \nestimated that the business earned about $10,000 to $15,000 per month after expenses. \nHowever, the business was never able to establish steady clients and there were \nsignificant fluctuations in income.

These included increased slowdowns related to the pandemic, mechanical \nissues with the trucks and difficulty in keeping a second driver. Applicant began taking \nout personal loans and lines of credit to maintain the business. Ultimately, the business \nceased operations in the summer of 2022. (GX 1-2; Tr. 28-35) \nIn June 2022, Applicant was hired as a trainee with a transportation company \nunder the premise that she would earn her Class A CDL and then work for the company. \nHowever, after she obtained her CDL, the company was unable to provide her a \nconsistently working truck and she left that employment in September 2022. In October \n2022, she started with another transportation company, but the work remained \ninconsistent and at best, she was able to bring home $2,000 a month. She left that \ncompany in October 2023. (GX 1-2; Tr. 35-40, 50-54) \nIn November 2023, Applicant began working with her husband for her current, \nsponsoring employer. She is receiving full-time work and described being on the road \nwith her husband for about ten weeks at a time. She estimated that after expenses, they \nare currently earning about $4,300 a month. (GX 2; Tr. 34-35, 65-70) \nApplicant stated since the failure of their business, she has taken several steps to \nreduce her expenses and try to resolve her ongoing financial delinquencies. In order to \nbe on the road for weeks at a time, she sent all four children from her home to live with \nother family members, although she is still providing $500 to $800 a month in financial \nsupport. She and her husband cancelled their apartment lease and tried living in the truck. \nHowever, they were unable to maintain that lifestyle and recently began renting another \napartment. (GX 2; Tr. 65 -84) \nIn August 2022, Applicant hired a law firm to consolidate her debt. She claimed \nthat, over the last two years, she met with them four to five times and issued several \npayments. However, she could not specify the services provided by the firm. She provided \ntwo letters from the firm, dated February 2023 and June 2024, that were identical in \ncontent and stated the firm had been retained by Applicant to \u201cassist in resolving her \nfinancial situation\u201d and assist with \u201cdebt resolution.\u201d (AX A-B) Neither letter detailed any \nactions that the firm had taken for Applicant. (GX 2; AX A-C; Tr. 35-37, 58-64) \nIn her October 2022 SCA, Applicant disclosed she was experiencing financial \nhardship. She provided details of her delinquent accounts during her February 2023 \ninterview with a DOD investigator. The evidence concerning the specific SOR allegations \nis summarized below. (GX 1-2) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a ($28,477) is a vehicle loan that was charged off. Applicant admitted this \ndebt and stated that, in August 2021, she took a loan of about $86,000 to purchase a \nlarger vehicle to transport her family. Following missed payments, it was involuntarily \nrepossessed in November 2022. She expressed regret in purchasing the vehicle, but \nbelieved that her finances were better at the time.

(GX 2-4; Tr. 67-68; 94-95) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($1,299), 1.d ($808) and 1.g ($234) are accounts in collection with the \nsame creditor. Applicant admitted these debts and stated these were payday loans she \ntook to keep the trucking business running. Applicant believed she made some payments \ntoward these loans but did not provide any details or supporting documentation. These \naccounts were listed in her November 2022 credit report, but are no longer listed in her \nJune 2024 credit report. These debts are unresolved. (GX 2-4; Tr. 68-72) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c ($990) is a delinquent credit card account that was charged off. \nApplicant denied this debt, but later recognized the creditor and stated she used this credit \ncard for business expenses. She claimed she spoke with the creditor and made a \npayment prior to the hearing. However, she did not provide any supporting \ndocumentation. The debt is listed as charged off in her November 2022 and June 2024 \ncredit reports. This debt is unresolved. (GX 2-4; Tr. 12, 71-73) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($624) is a collection account related to Applicant\u2019s membership in an \nathletic club. She denied this debt and claimed she previously cancelled the membership \nand paid the balance. She did not provide any documentation concerning her \ncorrespondence with the creditor or payment toward the debt. The debt was listed as a \ncollection in her November 2022 credit report and has since been listed as charged off in \nher June 2024 credit report. This debt is unresolved. (GX 2-4; Tr. 13, 74-75) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f ($317) is a collection account originating from a utility company. \nApplicant admitted this debt and stated it was a final bill she received following the \ntermination of a lease. She stated she was negotiating with the collection agency to pay \nthe debt. Following the hearing, she provided documentation reflecting the debt was paid \nin June 2024. This debt is resolved. (GX 2-4; AX D; Tr. 75-76) \nIn addition to the delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR, Applicant\u2019s June 2024 \ncredit report showed several new delinquent debts totaling about $17,800. Applicant \nrecognized these debts and claimed they were either directly related to her failed trucking \nbusiness or the financial difficulties that followed. (GX 4; Tr. 78-89) \nApplicant testified that, since she started with her current employer, her income \nhas been more consistent and her financial situation is improving. She described keeping \na budget, particularly to manage expenses related to the children, and had some \nremaining funds at the end of every month. She also testified that she would seek \nclarification from the law firm as to what services they were providing to resolve her \ndelinquent accounts, which she did not submit in the record.

As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d 484 \nU.S. 518, 531 (1988) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe financial security concern is broader than the possibility that an individual \nmight knowingly compromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses \nconcerns about an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to \nprotecting classified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also \nbe irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \nThe adjudicative guideline notes several conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence reflect that she has incurred multiple \ndelinquent accounts over that last several years. The above disqualifying conditions are \nestablished. \nOnce delinquent debt is established, an applicant has the burden of presenting \nevidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns arising from those \ndebts. ISCR 20-03146 at 3 (App. Bd. June 6, 2022). The fact that a debt no longer \nappears on a credit report does not establish any meaningful, independent evidence as \nto the disposition of the debt. ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 15, 2015). \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20.

These were unusual circumstances \nand largely beyond her control. Following the business failure, she tried lowering her \nexpenditures, looking for new employment and hiring a law firm to address her delinquent \naccounts. \nHowever, in the two years that followed the business failure, Applicant has only \nestablished that she paid and resolved one of the SOR alleged debts, \u00b6 1.f. Although she \nhired a law firm to conduct \u201cdebt resolution\u201d for her, she was unable to provide any details \nof what services they were providing on her behalf. There is no indication that the firm is \ncontesting any debts, negotiating the resolution of any debts or establishing any payment \nplans. She did not receive any financial counseling from them. \nFurther, Applicant\u2019s June 2024 credit report reflects that she continues to \nexperience new delinquent accounts. She claimed these additional accounts were largely \na continuation of the financial difficulties that followed the failure of her business. While \nthese debts were not alleged in the SOR, they undercut assertions of mitigation as her \nfinancial issues remain recent and ongoing.

Although her current \nemployment has provided consistent work and increased income, she has not yet \nestablished a track record of debt resolution to mitigate the ongoing financial security \nconcerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nLeading up to and through the business failure in 2022, Applicant experienced an \nextended period of financial difficulties. Although she took some steps to resolve her \ndelinquent accounts, she continues to experience new delinquent accounts and has not \nyet established a sufficient track record of responsible action to mitigate the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

He sets aside $250 per month for debt payments. \n(Item 8 at 2) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, \nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be \nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present \nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, \nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department \nCounsel. . ..\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable \nsecurity decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine \nadjudicative process factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbehavioral changes; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18)  \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of AG \u00b6 19(a), \n\u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant did not begin experiencing financial problems until the Navy miscalculated his \npay, resulting in an inadvertent overpayment, which it then corrected it by reducing his \npay drastically to recoup the overpayment. During the period Applicant\u2019s pay was \nreduced, he was unable to keep up with his debts. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAs of September 2023, Applicant had satisfied the debts, alleged in subparagraphs \n1.c and 1.d, totaling approximately $1,600. I resolve them in his favor. \nApplicant made a $100 payment towards the resolution of the debt alleged in \nsubparagraph 1.a, and he made a $50 payment towards the debt alleged in subparagraph \n1.e. However, he did not make these payments until after the issuance of the SOR. \nMoreover, his contention that he had set up a payment plan to satisfy the debt alleged in \nsubparagraph 1.b was unsupported by record evidence. Consequently, the \ncircumstances contributing to Applicant\u2019s financial problems were sufficiently beyond his \ncontrol to trigger the first part of AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial \nproblems were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . .\u201d Conversely, he did not provide \nenough evidence of bill payments to conclude he has been acting responsibly under the \ncircumstances, in order to trigger the second part of AG \u00b6 20(b).  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nApplicant\u2019s satisfaction of two of the SOR debts is sufficient to trigger the \napplication of AG \u00b6 20(d). However, although Applicant has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay debts, he just started paying the debt alleged in subparagraph 1.a after the \nissuance of the SOR, and he provided no evidence of a payment plan to satisfy \nsubparagraph 1.b. Under these circumstances, AG \u00b6 20(d) is only partially applicable. \nApplicant deserves credit for satisfying some of his delinquent debts. However, the \nthree largest delinquencies, subparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, and 1.e, remain outstanding. He \njust started satisfying the debt alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.a after the SOR\u2019s issuance \nand he provided no proof supporting his contention that he had implemented payment \nplans to satisfy the debts alleged in subparagraph 1.b and 1.e. Under these \ncircumstances, there is not enough evidence of a demonstrated track record of financial \nreform to conclude Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concern. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the whole-person concept factors in my analysis of the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions, discussed above, and they do not warrant a favorable \nconclusion. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs1.c \u2013 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 23, 2023, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued to Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline H, drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 11, 2023, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on August 28, \n2023. He was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM.

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and \nexhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 29 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2016. He is not married \nand has no children. He has worked for a government contractor since October 2022. \n(Item 1) \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in November 2022. In \nit he disclosed his past illegal drug use, purchases, and sales. Based on his admissions, \nthe SOR alleged the following: \nFrom about July 2014 to September 2022, Applicant used marijuana with \nvarying frequency and purchased and sold it on various occasions. (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b) \nFrom about June 2015 to December 2016, Applicant used ecstasy with \nvarying frequency and purchased ecstasy on various occasions.

(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o and \n1.p) \nFrom about December 2021 to July 2022, Applicant used nitrous oxide \n(N2O) with varying frequency and purchased it on various occasions. (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.q and 1.r) \nRegarding his future intention to use marijuana, ecstasy, mushrooms, LSD, \nAdderall and nitrous oxide gas, Applicant stated in his SCA that he would discontinue \ntheir uses in the future as per requirements of his employer\u2019s policies and to maintain a \nsecurity clearance. Having a good job and workplace were more important. (Item 2) \nRegarding his future use of DMT, Applicant said he did not intend to use it in the \nfuture because \u201cI got the experiences I sought from this substance; I have no desire to \nuse it again.\u201d Regarding future use of benzodiazepine, he said, \u201cI did not particularly enjoy \nor get anything out of using this substance and do not plan on using it ever again.\u201d \nRegarding future use of cocaine, he said he did not intend on using it in the future because \n\u201cthe last time I used it, I suffered a very painful reaction to it that resembled anaphylaxis, \nit was the most horrible experience I have ever had, it lasted several hours.\u201d He further \nstated, \u201cI am very grateful to be alive and strive more than ever to be healthy after the \nmistake I made of using this substance.\u201d (Item 2) \nApplicant made additional comments regarding his drug activity on his SCA. He \nrequested that his drug activity remain confidential and requested that anyone that wished \nto speak to him about his drug use do so in a private setting because where he works the \nwalls are very easy to hear through. He stated, \u201cI do not want any of my co-workers to \nknow any of this information that don\u2019t absolutely have to.\u201d (Item 2) \nApplicant completed government interrogatories in June 2023. He affirmed that his \nstatement made to the investigator was essentially accurate, except for some spelling of \nnames, biographical information, and work history. In addition, he noted that some \ninformation from his SCA was incorrectly copied and included as part of his interview. \nSpecifically, the quantity of cocaine he used each time and the number of times he \npurchased mushrooms. I have noted the discrepancies and will only consider the \ninformation regarding these facts taken from the SCA. Including in the interrogatories, \nApplicant reported the times he purchased different drugs, from whom, and the price. \n(Item 3) \nApplicant further stated that he no longer associates with anyone he previously \nused illegal drugs with. He said he moved to a new location, which has been a great \nchange for him. He enjoys his work environment, and his life is more peaceful and calm. \n(Item 3) \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, regarding future marijuana, ecstasy, DMT, LSD, \nmushrooms, benzodiazepines, Adderall, and cocaine use, he stated: \u201cI don\u2019t mind not \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nusing the substance and I don\u2019t intend to as long as I have a reason not; my employment.\u201d \n(Item 1) \nApplicant did not provide a response to the FORM or any information about \nparticipation in drug counseling or treatment. He did not provide an update on whether he \nhas continued to refrain from illegal drug use. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. \nAG \u00b6 25 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse; and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant \nillegally \nused \nmarijuana, \necstasy, \nDMT, \nLSD, mushrooms, \nbenzodiazepines, Adderall, and cocaine with varying frequencies and over different \nperiods of time beginning in July 2014 through October 2022. He illegally purchased \nthese drugs on various occasions. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe SOR alleged \u201cmushrooms\u201d and not hallucinogenic mushrooms. In Applicant\u2019s \nSCA, he reported under Section 23 the type of drug or controlled substance as \n\u201challucinogenic\u201d and the specific name as \u201cmushrooms.\u201d I find there is sufficient evidence \nthat the mushrooms purchased and used by Applicant were hallucinogenic. \nThe SOR alleged Applicant purchased and used nitrous oxide. There is no \nevidence that under federal or state law it is illegal to purchase nitrous oxide. I find AG \u00b6 \n25(c) does not apply to the purchase of nitrous oxide. I find in Applicant\u2019s favor for SOR \n\u00b6 1.r. I find AG \u00b6 25(a) applies to the use of nitrous oxide because as stated in AG \u00b6 24 \n\u201cthe use of other substances that cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a \nmanner inconsistent with their intended purpose\u201d raises a security concern.

The following mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 26 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome the problem, and has \nestablished a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: (1) \ndisassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or \navoiding the environment where drugs were being used; and (3) providing \na signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant has a long history of purchasing and using a variety of illegal drugs and \nan inhalant. He also infrequently sold marijuana to friends. While some of his drug usage \nwas during college, he continued his extensive use until October 2022, just prior to \napplying for a security clearance in November 2022. He said he last used marijuana and \nhallucinogenic mushrooms in September 2022. He said he last used LSD in October 2022 \nand he last used cocaine in February 2022. He stated in his interrogatories that he did \nnot intend to use illegal drugs in the future. In his answer to the SOR, he qualifies his \nintent and states: \u201cI don\u2019t mind not using the substance and I don\u2019t intend to as long as I \nhave a reason not to; (my employment).\u201d I have concerns about Applicant\u2019s qualifying \nstatement that he will follow the law as long as he retains his employment. This does not \nreflect a clear and convincing state of intent to refrain from the use of illegal drugs. It also \ndoes not reflect a grasp that when he purchased and used these drugs his actions were \nagainst the law. \nApplicant\u2019s willingness to illegally use and purchase an extensive array of drugs \nand an inhalant over many years is an important fact to consider. He said he no longer \nassociates with anyone who uses illegal drugs. He said that as long as he retains his \nemployment, he will refrain from illegal drug use. Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to question him about \nhis illegal drug use or evaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR \nCase No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). \nI have considered the lengthy period that Applicant used numerous types of illegal \ndrugs and an inhalant, his recent period of abstinence just prior to his employment, and \nhis motivation for ceasing his use. I am unable to find a sufficient period of abstinence \nhas expired and future use is unlikely to recur. His illegal drug use was frequent, and cast \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndoubts on his current reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. I find AG \u00b6 26(a) \ndoes not apply. \nApplicant acknowledged his past drug use and said he no longer associates with \ndrug-using associates. He moved to a new place. He indicated his intent to abstain from \ndrug involvement, albeit he qualified his abstinence as long as he had a reason not to use \nthe drugs, such as remaining employed. I find AG \u00b6 26(b) has some application, but it is \ninsufficient to fully mitigate the security concerns raised. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H, in my whole-person analysis. \nI have a duty to exercise prudence because the protection of the national security \nis the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel \nbeing considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d I am obligated to follow that directive.

His wife talks to her mother two or three times a week. (Tr. 26) \nApplicant\u2019s brother owns several businesses in Pakistan but is not active in them \nbecause of his poor health. Applicant talks to his brother about twice a month to check on \nhis health. (Tr. 30) He visited his brother in Pakistan in November 2022, in connection \nwith a vacation trip to Dubai. (Tr. 45) \nApplicant speaks with his sister-in-law only on special occasions, two or three \ntimes a year. His wife talks to her once or twice a week. (Tr. 32) He has no relationship \nwith his sister-in-law\u2019s husband, who is a colonel in the Pakistani Army, and he does not \nknow anything about the colonel\u2019s duties. (Tr. 34, 66) \nApplicant\u2019s brother-in-law resided in Pakistan until recently and was employed at \nthe U.S. Embassy in Pakistan for 20 years. His brother received a decoration upon his \ndeparture and received a flag that had been flown over the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad. \nHe now lives in the United States and has a green card.

Both friends \nhave worked for Applicant\u2019s employer for many years, and they talk quarterly on business \nmatters. (Tr. 38-42) \nIn April 2017, Applicant acquired an interest in undeveloped residential property in \nPakistan. He purchased it for about $28,000, and it is now worth about $40,000. (Tr. 41) \nThe property is controlled by the Pakistan Defence1 Housing Authority. Applicant \nexplained that the Housing Authority owns the real estate throughout Pakistan, and \nPakistani people buy property through the Housing Authority because it is the safest way \nto buy property, as compared private companies who \u201ctake your money and run away.\u201d \n(Tr. 62) He purchased the interest in the property because his wife has expressed interest \nin living in Pakistan after he retires. (Tr. 48) He does not expect to retire for another eight \nto ten years. (Tr. 68) He has not been allocated a specific plot of land. (Attachment to \nSOR Answer) The plots are small, about 500 square feet. (Tr. 51) He explained that his \nwife is interested in living in Pakistan, where she can have an easier life with maids and \ndrivers, but he and his children are not interested in moving back to Pakistan. (Tr. 53, 67) \nApplicant\u2019s assets in the United States are his home, which he purchased for about \n$200,000 in August 2021, a car leased in his wife\u2019s name, a bank account with a balance \nof about $10,000, and a retirement account worth about $56,000. He earns $19,500 per \nmonth before taxes and contributes to his retirement account. (Tr. 54-55) He has no \nassets in Pakistan except for the property interest described above.

(Tr. 58) His son also has a NICOP \nbecause he was born in Pakistan. \nI have taken administrative notice that Pakistan is a parliamentary federal republic \nwith whom the United States has had diplomatic relations since 1947. The parliament \nelected a new prime minister and head of government in April 2022. The election appears \nto have been conducted fairly and in accordance with the Pakistani constitution. \nTerrorist attacks in Pakistan are a continuing threat and have targeted U.S. \ndiplomats and diplomatic facilities. Terrorism increased in 2022. Pakistan has taken some \naction against terrorism, but its implementation of United Nations sanctions against \nterrorist entities has been uneven. The United States continues to urge Pakistan to take \ndecisive action against terrorist groups. The Department of State travel advisory for travel \nto Pakistan is Level 3 (reconsider travel due to terrorism). \nThe United States is Pakistan\u2019s largest export market, importing more than $5 \nbillion in Pakistani goods in 2021. The United States has also been a leading investor in \nPakistan for the past 20 years. However, Pakistan needs to strengthen its business \nregulation, including intellectual property protection. \nPakistan has a poor human-rights record and suffers from wide-spread \ngovernment corruption. U.S. civilian assistance to Pakistan has focused on several areas, \nincluding governance, the rule of law, treatment of refugees, law enforcement, and \ncountering infectious diseases such as COVID-19. \nPakistan is a nuclear-armed country. There have been several recent instances of \nillegal efforts by \u201cfront companies\u201d and U.S. citizens to export sensitive equipment, \ninformation, and technology from the United States to nuclear research agencies in \nPakistan. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. \nBd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual maybe manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those \nof the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \nFurthermore, \u201ceven friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the \nUnited States over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national \nsecurity.\u201d ISCR Case No. 00-0317 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002). Finally, we know friendly \nnations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, \nscientific, and technical fields. Nevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its \nrelationship with the United States, and its human-rights record are relevant in assessing \nthe likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country \nhas an authoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon \nthe government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States. In considering the nature of the government, an administrative judge must \nalso consider any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See ISCR Case No. 02-26130 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006).  \n \n \nThe following disqualifying conditions are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; \nAG \u00b6 7(e): shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \nAG \u00b6 7(f): substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsubject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation\nor personal conflict of interest. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), (d), (e) and (f) all require substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d \nThe \u201cheightened risk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively\nlow standard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in\nhaving a family member living under a foreign government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-\n05839 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 2013). \u201cHeightened risk\u201d is not a high standard. See, e.g.,\nISCR Case No.17-03026 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 16, 2019). It is a level of risk one step above\na State Department Level 1 travel advisory (\u201cexercise normal precaution\u201d) and equivalent\nto the Level 2 advisory (\u201cexercise increased caution\u201d) Applicant\u2019s family connections and\nfriends are sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 7(a), (d), and (e). The current value of his interest in\nundeveloped property is sufficient to constitute a \u201csubstantial\u201d financial interest within the\nmeaning of AG \u00b6 7(f) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well as each \nindividual family tie must be considered. ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep.\n22, 2003). Although Applicant has no personal connection with the Pakistani colonel\nmarried to his sister-in-law, an applicant\u2019s ties, either directly or through a family member,\nto persons of high rank in a foreign government or military are of particular concern,\ninsofar as it is foreseeable that through an association with such persons the applicant\ncould come to the attention of those interested in acquiring U.S. protected information.\nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-10025 at 2 and 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2009) (Applicant\u2019s\nbrother was a high-level foreign government official); ISCR Case No.11-04980 at 2 and\n6 (App. Bd. Sep. 21,2012) (Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law was married to a retired high-ranking\nofficial in a foreign army);and ISCR Case No. 11-12632 at 2 and 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 2, 2015)\n(Applicant\u2019s niece was an employee of a high-ranking foreign government official).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBased on the evidence set out above, I conclude that the disqualifying conditions \nin AG \u00b6 7(a), 7(d), 7(e), and 7(f) are established. The following mitigating conditions are \npotentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \nAG \u00b6 8(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s continuing contacts with his brother and \ntwo business associates in Pakistan preclude a finding that it is unlikely that he will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government. \nAG 8(b) is established. Applicant and his immediate family have some cultural \nattachment to Pakistan, but no feelings of allegiance to the government. Applicant has \nworked for a U.S.-based employer for 20 years. His wife, children, and mother are citizens \nand residents of the United States. One of his brothers worked at the U.S. Embassy in \nPakistan for 20 years, was recognized for his loyalty and service to the United States, has \nmoved to the United States, and intends to become a U.S. citizen. The desire of \nApplicant\u2019s wife to live in Pakistan after he retires raises some concern, but Applicant \ndoes not share her desire. Even if he acquiesces in his wife\u2019s desire, it will not occur until \nhe retires and no longer has access to classified information, which likely will not occur \nfor at least ten years. \nAG \u00b6 8(c) is established for Applicant\u2019s contacts his sister-in-law\u2019s spouse, a \nPakistani colonel, with whom he has no contact. It is established for his mother-in-law \nand his sister-in-law, with whom he has only casual and infrequent contacts. It is not \nestablished for his two business associates in Afghanistan, with whom he has regular and \nsubstantive contacts. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant was sincere, candid, and \ncredible at the hearing. He has affection for Pakistan but, based on his business \nexperience, he understands its shortcomings. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline B, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his \nfamily and economic connections to Pakistan. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B (Foreign Influence): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraph 1.g-1.i: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

The DCSA CAS acted under Executive Order (Exec. \nOr.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016), which became effective \non June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR in an undated document and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge.

On April 16, 2024, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled \nto be conducted by video teleconference on May 9, 2024. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 7 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through C, which \nwere admitted without objection. I kept the record open until May 23, 2024, to enable him \nto submit additional documentary evidence. He timely submitted AX D, E, and F, which \nwere admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on May 20, 2024. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations in the SOR, with \nexplanations. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 33-year-old shipyard cleaner employed by a defense contractor \nsince May 2023. He did not complete high school, but he later earned his diploma online \nin 2019. He married in July 2017, but he is \u201ckind of separated.\u201d (Tr. 58) He has a 12-year-\nold stepdaughter and a six-month-old child. He was granted a security clearance while \nhe was a government employee. \nApplicant was employed by the U.S. Government from September 2012 until he \nwas laid off in March 2020, because the COVID pandemic prevented him from completing \nthe educational requirement for renewing his certificate as a mariner. He was unable to \nfind other employment until he was hired by a defense contractor in October 2021. He \nwas laid off in July 2022 and worked for another defense contractor from August 2022, \nwith annual pay of $30,000 less than he had been earning. Seeking higher pay, he worked \nfor another contractor for two months, and then was hired by his current employer in May \n2023. He recently received a pay raise from $27 per hour to $37 per hour. His take-home \npay is now about $1,400 per week. (Tr. 32-36, 68) \nThe SOR alleges six delinquent debts. Applicant testified that he briefly dealt with \nfour debt-settlement companies but was unable to resolve any of his debts. His income \nwas barely enough to pay his home mortgage loan, insurance, car loan, and grocery bills. \n(Tr. 41) On May 8, 2024, he hired a debt-negotiation law firm to resolve four of the seven \ndebts alleged in the SOR. He is required to pay the law firm $253 every two weeks. (Tr. \n65) The four debts to be handled by the law firm are alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.d, and \n1.g. He testified that he did not hire the law firm earlier because of his limited finances, \nbut the $10-per-hour pay raise gave him sufficient income to begin resolving his debts. \n(Tr. 43) The evidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: credit-card account charged off for $7,077. Applicant opened this \naccount in June 2017 and stopped making payments in October 2021 because he could \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nnot afford them. (Tr. 38) His law firm agreed to handle this debt. (AX A at 9) As of the date \nof the hearing, the debt was not resolved. After the hearing, he submitted an email in \nwhich he stated that he contacted this creditor directly and the creditor agreed to settle \nthe debt for $2,451. (AX E) He did not submit any documentation of an agreement.  \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: credit-card account charged off for $4,302. Applicant stopped \nmaking payments on this debt in December 2021. The debt is not included in the list of \ndebts referred to the law firm. At the hearing, Applicant testified that he was not sure why \nthis debt was not included in his law firm\u2019s plan. (Tr. 45) In a post-hearing email, he stated \nthat this debt had been sold to a third-party collection agent, but he had not yet determined \nthe identity of the collection agent. (AX E) He submitted no evidence of efforts to resolve \nthis debt before it was referred to a collection agent. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: credit-card account charged off for $3,241. Applicant opened this \naccount in April 2012. He stopped making payments when he was laid off due to COVID. \nHis law firm agreed to handle this debt. (AX A at 9) On May 22, 2024, the day before the \nrecord closed, the creditor agreed to settle this debt for $810.42, payable in $200 monthly \npayments. (AX D at 2) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: personal loan charged off for $1,448. Applicant testified that he \nobtained this loan in February 2020 to make the payments on his home mortgage. He \nstopped making payments in June 2020 (Tr. 48-49) His law firm agreed to handle this \ndebt. (AX A at 9) He testified that he had several conversations with this creditor after he \nreceived the SOR, but he did not reach a settlement agreement. (Tr. 49-50) The debt is \nnot resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: personal loan referred for collection and charged off for $1,296. \nThis debt is not included in the law firm\u2019s plan. Applicant testified that the collection \nagency incorrectly reflected the amount of the loan, and it corrected the error and sent \nhim a check for the difference. (Tr. 51) After the hearing, he submitted a copy of a check \nfrom the collection agency for $248, dated August 28, 2023. (AX F) He did not submit any \nevidence of payments or other resolution of the debt. It is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: credit-card account referred for collection of $594. This debt is not \nincluded in the law firm\u2019s plan. In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he submitted \ndocumentation reflecting that he had a payment plan to resolve this debt by monthly \npayments of $99.10, beginning in July 2023. In his answer to the SOR, he submitted \ndocumentary evidence reflecting that he made the July 2023 payment, but his \ndocumentation does not reflect whether he made any subsequent payments. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: credit-card account charged off for $15,649. Applicant\u2019s law firm \nagreed to handle this debt.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan at 531. \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).

Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s debts are recent, numerous, and were \nnot incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant\u2019s inability to renew his mariner\u2019s certificate \nbecause of the COVID pandemic and subsequent unemployment were conditions beyond \nhis control. His marital separation was a condition beyond his control, but he did not \nsubmit evidence of the financial impact of the separation. He did not act responsibly. In \nJune 2021, he agreed to make bi-weekly payments of $200 on the debt alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.g until the balance was paid, but he stopped making payments in May 2023. In July \n2023, he negotiated a payment plan for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f, but he submitted \nno evidence that he made the agreed payments. He took no significant action to resolve \nthe other delinquent debts until his hearing was imminent. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. The law firm retained by Applicant does not provide \nthe financial counseling of the type contemplated by this mitigating condition. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant hired a debt-negotiation law firm to assist \nhim, but it has settled only one debt, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b is not \nincluded in his firm\u2019s settlement plan. He testified that he personally negotiated payment \nplans for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.g, but he provided no documentary \nevidence of payment plans. He provided documentary evidence of a payment plan for the \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f, but no documentary evidence of any payments under the plan, \nother than the one payment in July 2023. An applicant who claims that a debt has been \nsettled or is being settled is expected to provide documentary evidence supporting those \nclaims. See ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 19, 2016).  \nIn his post-hearing submissions, Applicant has promised to make payments on the \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c, 1.f, and 1.g.

ISCR Case No. 17-04110 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). \nPayment of a delinquent debt motivated by the pressure of qualifying for a security \nclearance is not a \u201cgood faith effort\u201d within the meaning of AG \u00b6 20(d). Applicant did not \nhire his law firm until May 2024, after he received the notice of hearing. He did not contact \nthe creditors alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.g until after the hearing. An applicant who waits \nuntil his or her clearance is in jeopardy before resolving debts may be lacking in the \njudgment expected of those with access to classified information. ISCR Case No. 16-\n01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018) citing ISCR Case No. 15-03208 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 7, \n2017). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant was sincere and credible at \nthe hearing, but he has not presented documentary evidence of a credible and reasonable \nplan to resolve his delinquent debts. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions under Guideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his \ndelinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

I find that those allegations are \nestablished unless I have noted otherwise. Between about 2010 and 2013, Applicant \nabused the prescription opiate Hydrocodone by taking more of it than prescribed for \npain relief following back surgery. He also illegally purchased Hydrocodone between \n2010 and 2013. Contrary to the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a, Applicant did not abuse \nHydrocodone in 2021 because he used it as prescribed.

At all times relevant to this investigation, marijuana possession \n(and therefore its use) has been illegal. Marijuana and Hydrocodone are both controlled \nsubstances. He claimed that he has not used an illegal drug since September 2021 or \nmisused a prescription drug since 2013. (Items 2, 3, 5, 6) \nIn approximately September 2021, Applicant was arrested and charged with \nfelony possession of a controlled substance. He drove through a park while taking \nseveral \u201cvape\u201d hits of marijuana. He was stopped by police for excessive speed and \nwas arrested after police smelled marijuana in his vehicle. He admitted that he had \nrecently smoked it and was transported to a local jail where he spent the night. He was \nreleased the next day. The charges were ultimately dismissed however, he was \nrequired to undergo scheduled drug testing. (Items 2, 5, 6) \nApplicant waited until about July 2022 to report his September 2021 arrest to his \nfacility security officer (FSO). When his FSO asked why he waited so long to report the \narrest, he said he waited because he was afraid to lose his job. (Items 2, 3, 5, 6) \nIn March 2019, Applicant was charged with possession of marijuana in a drug \nfree zone after police found it in his car and in his pocket. The relevant court ultimately \ndismissed the charges. Applicant acknowledged purchasing and possessing marijuana \nbut claimed that he was not using it at the time. He claimed that he bought it and was \nbringing it to his brother-in-law to use to treat nausea from chemotherapy. He reported \nthis arrest to his FSO a few days afterward. (Items 2, 3, 5, 6) \nIn about February 2007, Applicant pleaded nolo contendere to felony driving \nunder the influence of alcohol (DUI) after he drove while intoxicated over the legal limit. \nDuring his July 2017 security interview with a DOD investigator, he claimed that he was \narrested on a misdemeanor DUI charge as opposed to a felony DUI charge. However, \nin his Response to the SOR, he admitted without additional comment that he was \ncharged with felony DUI. The court granted him a deferred disposition.

(Items 2, 5) \nDespite being required to do so, Applicant failed to disclose purchasing and \nmisusing Hydrocodone on his October 2016 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations \nProcessing (2016 e-QIP) and his July 2019 Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations \nProcessing (2019 e-QIP). He certified that his statements on these e-QIPs were true, \ncomplete, and correct to the best of his knowledge and belief. In his Response to the \nSOR, he admitted without additional comment that he deliberately failed to disclose his \nmisuse and purchase of opiates. During his March 2023 security interview, he told a \nDOD investigator that he did not disclose his Hydrocodone misuse because he was \nafraid that he would not be able to maintain his employment or find other employment. \nWhile there is evidence that he volunteered his Hydrocodone abuse in March 2023 prior \nto being confronted with it, he only did so years after he should have. He also divulged it \nonly when explaining away his 2021 marijuana possession and arrest. (Items 1-5) \nIn March 2023, in Applicant\u2019s response to the Government\u2019s interrogatories, \nApplicant certified to the best of his knowledge and belief that he only ever used \nmarijuana in 2021. This information is inconsistent with what he told the DOD \ninvestigator during his February 2020 security interview, when he said that he also tried \nmarijuana in about 2004 when he was about 17. In his Response to the SOR, he \nadmitted without additional comment that he deliberately failed to disclose all his \nmarijuana use. He did not provide evidence to show that he volunteered this information \nprior to being confronted with it. (Items 1, 5) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant illegally used and possessed marijuana in 2004. He also illegally \npurchased and possessed marijuana in 2019, and he illegally purchased, possessed, \nand used marijuana from July 2021 until September 2021. From July 2021 to \nSeptember 2021, he used marijuana while he was granted access to classified \ninformation. He also misused and illegally purchased Hydrocodone from about 2010 \nuntil about 2013. The above disqualifying conditions are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe of prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended. \nApplicant has mitigated his misuse and purchase of Hydrocodone. It has been \nover ten years since he last abused it, misused it, or illegally purchased it. While he was \nusing it in 2021 after another surgery, there is no evidence that he was using it other \nthan as prescribed. All the above-listed mitigating conditions are applicable to his \nHydrocodone abuse, misuse, and illegal purchase. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIt has been about two and one-half years since Applicant was involved with \nmarijuana. Other than his one-time use in about 2004, the circumstances surrounding \nhis marijuana involvement have been to alleviate pain relief for himself and his brother-\nin-law. Although he used marijuana frequently during a three-month period in mid-2021 \nwhile he held a security clearance, that use was confined to a relatively short period \nwhen he was managing post-surgery pain and trying to avoid over-reliance on \nHydrocodone. Given this period of abstinence, he no longer relies on marijuana \ninvolvement for those issues. Available evidence shows that his marijuana involvement \noccurred under circumstances that are unlikely to recur (his own illness and his brother-\nin-law\u2019s illness). I find that his period of abstinence since September 2021 is sufficient in \nrelation to the limited and somewhat unusual circumstances of his marijuana \ninvolvement. AG \u00b6 26(a) and AG \u00b6 26(b) fully apply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity eligibility determination, or other government official; and \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant had a 2007 felony DUI charge. This charge and his illegal drug \ninvolvement were insufficient for an adverse adjudication under another Guideline, but \nthey support a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, unreliability, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, indicating that he may not properly \nsafeguard classified or sensitive information. He also deliberately failed to disclose his \nillegal drug involvement on multiple e-QIPs, and his response to Government \ninterrogatories. All the above disqualifying conditions are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply in Applicant's case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nIt has been about 17 years since Applicant\u2019s DUI charge, and there is no \nindication that he has continued to drink and drive. For similar reasons that I included in \nmy analysis under Guideline H, I find that his drug involvement and substance misuse \nhappened under unique circumstances and is unlikely to recur. I find that AG \u00b6 17(c) is \nfully applicable to the 2007 DUI and the cross-alleged Guideline H allegations, and \nthose allegations are mitigated. \nApplicant arguably corrected his omission or concealment of his illegal \nHydrocodone involvement to a DOD investigator prior to being confronted with the facts. \nHowever, he did so years after it occurred, and only when it benefitted him to justify his \nmarijuana involvement. Therefore, his correction was not prompt or made in good faith. \nHe also did not correct his falsification of the full extent of his marijuana involvement in \nhis response to Government\u2019s interrogatories. AG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply. \nDeliberately omitting required information during the security clearance process \nis not minor. Instead, this action strikes at the heart of the process, which relies on \ncandid and honest reporting. Applicant engaged in this deceitful and misleading activity \nmultiple times over two separate investigations. He also repeated it in 2023 when he did \nnot reveal the full extent of his marijuana involvement in his response to the \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGovernment\u2019s interrogatories. Therefore, he has not shown that his behavior was \ninfrequent, happened under unique circumstances, or is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 17(c) \ndoes not apply. \nWhile Applicant ultimately acknowledged his intentionally dishonest behavior, he \nhas provided no evidence of counseling or other steps he has taken to alleviate this \nbehavior. Moreover, for the reasons I provided in my analysis of AG \u00b6 17(c), I cannot \nfind his behavior is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 17(d) does not apply. \nApplicant has taken some positive steps to reduce vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, or duress. He eventually told the DOD investigator about his \nHydrocodone and marijuana involvement, and he eventually told his FSO about his \nmarijuana involvement and possession charges. AG \u00b6 17(e) partially applies but does \nnot overcome his repeated deceitful and untrustworthy personal conduct. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines H and E in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude he mitigated the \ndrug involvement and substance misuse security concerns but not the personal conduct \nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.c-2.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.
