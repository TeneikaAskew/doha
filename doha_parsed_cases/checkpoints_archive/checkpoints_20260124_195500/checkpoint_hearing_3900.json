He has had access to classified information since June 2011, and he \nhas stated his intent to use marijuana in the future. Applicant did not mitigate the resulting \nsecurity concerns about drug involvement and substance misuse. His request for \neligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn June 10, 2021, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to renew his eligibility for access to classified \ninformation required for his employment with a federal contractor. After reviewing the \nresults of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the Department of \nDefense (DOD) could not determine that it was clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security for Applicant to have access to classified information, as required by \nExecutive Order 10865, as amended, and by DOD Directive 5220.6 (Directive). \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \nOn December 13, 2022, the DOD sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts and security concerns addressed under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse). The action was taken pursuant to and consistent with Executive \nOrder (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a decision without \na hearing. On April 18, 2023, as provided for by paragraph E3.1.7 of the Directive, \nDepartment Counsel for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nFile of Relevant Material (FORM) that Applicant received on May 18, 2023. The FORM \ncontained six exhibits (Items 1 \u2013 6) on which the Government relies to support the SOR \nallegations. \nApplicant was advised he had 30 days from receipt of the FORM to object to any \nof the Government\u2019s exhibits and to provide additional information in response to the \nFORM. He did not submit any additional information and he did not raise any objections \nto the Government\u2019s exhibits. The record closed on June 20, 2023, and I received the \ncase for decision on September 13, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana between 1968 \nand January 2022 (SOR 1.a); that between June 2014 and January 2022, his use of \nmarijuana occurred while he had access to classified information (SOR 1.b); and that he \nintends to continue using marijuana (SOR 1.c). (FORM, Item 1) \nIn response to the SOR, he admitted, with comments, the allegations at SOR 1.a \nand 1.b. He denied, with comments, the SOR 1.c allegation. (FORM, Item 2) The facts \nalleged at SOR 1.a and 1.b are established by his admissions, and based on my review \nof the information presented in the FORM, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 71-year-old employee of a federal contractor, for whom he has \nworked in an information technology (IT) position since November 2010. He earned a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 1982, and he has been married since 1984. He and his wife have \none adult child. (FORM, Item 3) \nApplicant disclosed in Section 23 (Illegal Use of Drugs or Drug Activity) of his 2021 \ne-QIP that he used marijuana between June 2014 and May 2020. He could not state with \nany precision how many times or how often he used marijuana because he did not use \nor possess the drug unless he happened to be socializing with friends who were using \nmarijuana and offered it to him. As to his intentions regarding future use of marijuana, he \nstated the following: \nI\u2019d be lying if I said I wasn\u2019t going to ever, ever again have a smoke knowing \nit\u2019s quite likely I will find myself (as I have in the past) in a situation sometime \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nin the future where others are passing it around. You might find this \nincredible to believe, but marijuana is really popular, especially now that it \nis (about to be) legal in [the state where he lives and works]. (FORM, Item \n3) \nOn August 25, 2021, Applicant completed a personal subject interview (PSI) by a \ngovernment investigator as part of his most recent background investigation. During the \nPSI, he confirmed his disclosed use between 2014 and 2020, estimating he smokes \nmarijuana between three and six times a year when it is offered to him in social settings. \nHe also stated that he knows his drug use violates federal workplace policies. In response \nto interrogatories from Department Counsel, Applicant disclosed that he has used \nmarijuana since 1968, but ceased frequent use in 1984. When he was first hired by his \ncurrent employer in 2010, he submitted an e-QIP in which he was required to disclose, \ninter alia, any illegal drug use in the preceding seven years. He answered \u201cno\u201d to all of \nthe Section 23 questions in that clearance application. He was first granted a security \nclearance and access to classified information based on a background investigation \ncompleted in March 2011. As to his future intent to use marijuana, Applicant now avers \nthat he will abstain from using marijuana while he has \u201can active security clearance.\u201d \n(FORM, Items 2, 5, and 6) \nSua sponte, I take administrative notice of the fact that marijuana is a Schedule I \ncontrolled substance, the use and possession of which is a criminal violation of federal \nlaw. Guidance issued by the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (OASD) in \nFebruary 2013, and by the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) in December 2021, \nmakes clear that changes in the laws pertaining to marijuana by the various states, \nterritories, and the District of Columbia do not alter the current National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines. Because federal law supersedes state laws on this issue, \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana, regardless of location or medical justification in his state of \nresidence, is illegal. Further, federal workplaces prohibit illegal drug use by civilian federal \nemployees and by persons employed for work on federal contracts. \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those \nfactors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988)) \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe Government presented information that reasonably raises the security \nconcern about drug involvement stated at AG \u00b6 24 as follows: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant has illegally used marijuana since 1968, when he was a teenager. \nDespite claiming he has not used it frequently since 1984, he has continued to use it until \nas recently as early 2022, after age 70. He also has illegally used marijuana while having \naccess to classified information as a defense contractor. As to his future intent regarding \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nillegal drug use, his statements in his latest e-QIP, in his PSI, and in response to the SOR \nshow that he is likely to use if offered the drug by people with whom, apparently, he still \nassociates. Further, he offers that he will not use marijuana while he has \u201can active \nsecurity clearance.\u201d At a minimum, his statements in this regard fail to show that he is \nclearly committed to abstaining from using marijuana in the future. The foregoing requires \napplication of the following AG \u00b6 25 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) any drug abuse (see above definition); \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or holding a \nsensitive position; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nBy contrast, I have considered the potential applicability of the pertinent mitigating \nconditions presented under AG \u00b6 26: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nDepartment Counsel presented sufficient evidence to support the SOR allegations \nand raise security concerns under this guideline. It thus fell to Applicant to present \ninformation that warrants application of any pertinent mitigating conditions. Applicant did \nnot present information that would support any of these mitigating conditions. His history \nof drug use is extensive, occurring as it has for most of his life, and he did not present \nsufficient information to show that the circumstances surrounding his drug use have \nchanged. To the contrary, he suggests they have not. Additionally, even if, as alleged in \nthe SOR, he has not used marijuana since January 2022, such a recent period of \nabstinence would not be sufficient, when compared to the previous five decades, to show \nthat his conduct will not recur. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs to future intent, his statements are equivocal, at best, making future use \ncontingent on whether he has a clearance. Thus, if he does not have a clearance, then he \nwould still be willing to disregard existing laws and policy governing controlled substances. \nI also note that he did not disclose any drug use in the e-QIP he submitted in 2010, when \nhe was first hired by his employer. His initial clearance was granted in 2011 based on \nincomplete information. When he was interviewed by a government investigator during his \nmost recent background investigation, he did not explain the full scope of his drug use, \nchoosing instead to confirm his statement that he had used marijuana since 2014. It was \nnot until he responded to Department Counsel\u2019s interrogatories in January 2023 that he \ndisclosed the full extent of his illegal drug use. The Government did not allege that he \nmade any false official statements about his drug use. Nonetheless, I have considered his \nomissions (as well as the flippant nature of some of his comments regarding his drug use) \nfor the limited purpose of assessing his credibility, evaluating his evidence of extenuation, \nmitigation, or changed circumstances, and considering whether he has demonstrated \nsuccessful rehabilitation. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16, \n2017). \nFinally, while Applicant\u2019s drug use may be legal under the laws of his state, it is still \nimpermissible under federal controlled substances laws and DOD industrial security policy \nguidance. During his PSI, he acknowledged his awareness that using marijuana was \ninconsistent with DOD policies regarding illegal drug use in the workplace. On balance, \nApplicant did not mitigate the security concerns established by the Government\u2019s \ninformation. \nIn addition to my evaluation of the facts and my application of the appropriate \nadjudicative factors under Guideline H, I have reviewed the record before me in the \ncontext of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, \nalong with the Government\u2019s information, leaves unchanged the doubts raised about his \njudgment, reliability, and willingness to follow rules and regulations regarding the \nprotection of sensitive information. Because the protection of the national interest is the \nprincipal goal of these adjudications, those doubts must be resolved against the \nApplicant. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all available information, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security for Applicant to have access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his SOR answer, Applicant admitted all the allegations, with some explanations. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began working at his present job in 2014. He has been married for 23 years. He has two minor children and one adult child, all whom live with him. (Tr. 6, 17-19; GE 1) The SOR alleged Applicant owed approximately $8,742 from his 2017 federal tax return and approximately $1,082 from his 2018 federal tax return. He admitted these debts in his SOR answer and during his hearing testimony. (Tr. 20-21; SOR answer) Applicant testified that he owed delinquent taxes for 2017 and 2018 because his tax preparer filed an erroneous 2017 tax return, which resulted in a higher tax bill for that year and 2018. Applicant documented reaching an agreement with the IRS on the tax amount owed and began making monthly payments of approximately $153. He made these payments from December 2021 until June 2022, when he stopped because he was made aware of the erroneous 2017 return. He hired a tax preparation company in November 2022 to investigate the possible error and file an amended return if warranted. In the meantime, he was advised to restart making his monthly payments of $154 to the IRS, which was to begin in July 2023. He documented his agreement with the tax preparation company and the comp",

The \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on May 10, \n2023, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on May 23, 2023.

He submitted exhibits (AE) A-C, which were admitted without objection. \nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on June 5, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant admitted all the allegations, with some \nexplanations. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a review of the \npleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 45-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He began working \nat his present job in 2014. He has been married for 23 years. He has two minor children \nand one adult child, all whom live with him. (Tr. 6, 17-19; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant owed approximately $8,742 from his 2017 federal tax \nreturn and approximately $1,082 from his 2018 federal tax return. He admitted these \ndebts in his SOR answer and during his hearing testimony. (Tr. 20-21; SOR answer) \nApplicant testified that he owed delinquent taxes for 2017 and 2018 because his \ntax preparer filed an erroneous 2017 tax return, which resulted in a higher tax bill for \nthat year and 2018. Applicant documented reaching an agreement with the IRS on the \ntax amount owed and began making monthly payments of approximately $153. He \nmade these payments from December 2021 until June 2022, when he stopped because \nhe was made aware of the erroneous 2017 return. He hired a tax preparation company \nin November 2022 to investigate the possible error and file an amended return if \nwarranted. In the meantime, he was advised to restart making his monthly payments of \n$154 to the IRS, which was to begin in July 2023. He documented his agreement with \nthe tax preparation company and the company corroborated his settlement agreement \nwith the IRS. (Tr. 20-22; AE A) \nThe SOR also alleged Applicant owed 10 delinquent accounts (debt \nconsolidation loan, credit cards, and consumer debts) totaling approximately $39,000. \nThe debts are established by credit reports from August 2021, March 2022, October \n2022, and May 2023; Appellant\u2019s SOR admissions; and his hearing testimony. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.c \u2013 1.l). (Tr. 27; GE 3-6; SOR answer) \nApplicant admitted all the SOR debts during his testimony. He also admitted that \nhe has not made any payments toward any of the debts as of the date of the hearing. \nHe admitted living beyond his means. He substantiated that one debt was paid (SOR \u00b6 \n1.e) through the enforcement of a court-ordered garnishment in 2022 for a debt where \nthe creditor had obtained a judgment. Applicant did not voluntarily contribute to the \npayment of this debt. All the remaining debts remain unresolved.

Post-hearing, a representative from the DRC provided \na letter stating that it was going to work with Applicant to help resolve his credit issues \nby removing negative entries from his credit report. There is no information in the letter \ndetailing a plan to pay Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts. (Tr. 25-26, 44; AE C) \nApplicant did not provide a formalized budget, but he testified that his monthly \n\u201ctake-home pay\u201d is about $3,700 and his wife\u2019s is about $2,000. He stated that he barely \ncovers his monthly expenses. His testimony revealed that he is currently two months \nbehind on making his two vehicle payments. (Since this information was not alleged in \nthe SOR, I will use it only as it pertains to applicability of any mitigating conditions and in \napplying the whole-person factors) He also stated that he has approximately $36,000 in \nhis retirement account. (Tr. 40-41, 44-46) \nApplicant\u2019s SOR answer related that his financial problems started when his wife \n\u201cgot COVID-19 and lost her job.\u201d He did not provide a date when this occurred. He later \ntestified that his wife started working again in June 2022 and continues to do so. He did \nnot pay or set up payment plans for any of the SOR debts after his wife began working \nagain. (Tr. 30-31; SOR answer) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant accumulated numerous delinquent debts, which remain unpaid or \nunresolved. He also admitted owing federal taxes for 2017 and 2018. I find all of the \nabove disqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment; \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and    \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent and he admitted that he has not paid or resolved \nthem. He failed to produce evidence showing that recurrence of his financial problems is \nunlikely. On the contrary he is now delinquent paying his two car loans. AG \u00b6 20(a) is \nnot applicable. \nWhile Applicant\u2019s wife unemployment due to the pandemic is a condition beyond \nhis control, however, by failing to address his debts he has not acted responsibly. He \nadmittedly was living beyond his means, and the only SOR debt paid was done through \nan involuntary garnishment. AG \u00b6 20(b) is partially applicable. \nAside from his contact with a DRC to help him remove items from his credit \nreport and his hiring of a tax firm to assist with his tax issues, Applicant did not present \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nevidence of financial counseling. He failed to establish good-faith efforts to resolve his \ndebts. The payment from the garnishment action is not a good-faith payment. Given the \nunpaid status of his debts and his new past-due debts, Applicant\u2019s financial problems \nare not under control. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and AG 20(d) do not apply. Applicant acted promptly \nto address his tax issues and arranged monthly payments to the IRS beginning in \nDecember 2021. He continued making those payments until he was advised his 2017 \ntax return may contain an error. While that issue is being considered, Applicant is \nscheduled to begin monthly payments again. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.b are being resolved. AG \u00b6 \n20(e) applies to those allegations. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s his wife\u2019s unemployment due to the pandemic, and the \ncircumstances surrounding his indebtedness. However, I also considered that he has \nmade insufficient efforts to resolve his debts and he has accumulated new delinquent \ndebt since the SOR was issued. He has not established a meaningful track record of \nfinancial responsibility, which causes me to question his ability to resolve his debts. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a-1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs: 1.c-1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the SOR allegations in his Answer. He is 42 years old. He is married and he has one child, a minor. He previously owned a home between September 2003 and October 2021. As of his October 2021 security clearance application (SCA), he has owned a home since July 2012. He attended college from 2009 to 2021 but did not earn a degree. He has worked as an electronic technician for his employer, a DOD contractor, since February 2006. He was granted a security clearance in 2012. (Items 1-2) The SOR alleges that Applicant had a $12,558 delinquent consumer debt and a $40 delinquent medical debt. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b) The SOR also alleges that Applicant falsified his response to questions in section 26 of his 2021 SCA, which inquired about financial delinquencies, when he failed to disclose SOR \u00b6 1.a and an unalleged $54,756 past-due mortgage account. (SOR \u00b6 2.a) In addition to his admissions in his Answer, Applicant discussed his delinquent debts in his January 2022 and February 2022 interviews with a background investigator, and in his June 2022 response to interrogatories. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, and his past-due mortgage account referenced in SOR \u00b6 2.a, are reported in a December 2021 credit bureau report.

He elected to \nhave his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. The Government\u2019s \nwritten case was submitted on September 21, 2022.

The case was assigned to me on January 18, 2023. The Government\u2019s \ndocuments, identified as Items 1 through 7 in its FORM, are admitted in evidence \nwithout objection. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in his Answer. He is 42 years old. He is \nmarried and he has one child, a minor. He previously owned a home between \nSeptember 2003 and October 2021. As of his October 2021 security clearance \napplication (SCA), he has owned a home since July 2012. He attended college from \n2009 to 2021 but did not earn a degree. He has worked as an electronic technician for \nhis employer, a DOD contractor, since February 2006. He was granted a security \nclearance in 2012. (Items 1-2) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant had a $12,558 delinquent consumer debt and a \n$40 delinquent medical debt. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b) The SOR also alleges that Applicant \nfalsified his response to questions in section 26 of his 2021 SCA, which inquired about \nfinancial delinquencies, when he failed to disclose SOR \u00b6 1.a and an unalleged $54,756 \npast-due mortgage account. (SOR \u00b6 2.a) In addition to his admissions in his Answer, \nApplicant discussed his delinquent debts in his January 2022 and February 2022 \ninterviews with a background investigator, and in his June 2022 response to \ninterrogatories. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, and his past-due mortgage account referenced in \nSOR \u00b6 2.a, are reported in a December 2021 credit bureau report. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b \nare also reported in a September 2022 credit bureau report. Incident reports from the \nDefense Information System for Security Case Adjudication Tracking System also \nreflect Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts. (Items 1-7) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a is for a charged-off credit card. Applicant indicated during his \nbackground interviews that he neglected to set up auto-payments after this account was \ntransferred to a different servicer. He then forgot about it because he did not receive \nany notices from the creditor about a delinquent balance, and he was unaware it was \ndelinquent. He intended to contact the creditor to resolve this debt. He stated in his \nresponse to interrogatories that he had not made efforts to resolve this debt. (Item 3) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is a medical debt for a 2020 emergency room visit. Applicant indicated \nduring both of his background interviews that he forgot about this debt, and he was \nunaware it was delinquent. He thought his medical insurance paid it and he was never \nbilled for it. He intended to contact the creditor to pay this debt. He failed to provide \ndocumentation to corroborate his efforts at resolution. (Item 3) \nApplicant maintained during his February 2022 background interview that he did \nnot intend to deceive by failing to disclose his past-due mortgage account on his SCA. \nHe indicated that this mortgage is for his primary residence. In late 2019, he made an \nerror when he attempted to rearrange his automatically deducted monthly mortgage \npayment on the creditor\u2019s website. His last mortgage payment was auto deducted in \nDecember 2019, and he made no subsequent mortgage payments. He indicated that he \nattempted to correct his mistake on multiple occasions during the COVID-19 pandemic, \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nbut he never received a live representative when he contacted the creditor\u2019s customer \nservice department. He acknowledged that he was neglectful and irresponsible in failing \nto continue to follow up with the customer service department. In early 2022, he \nreached a live representative who arranged for him to make a $63,890 payment at a \nretail branch, which brought his mortgage current. He was able to make such a payment \nbecause his \u201cbudgeted mortgage payment fund was still in my account,\u201d and he used \nsavings to pay the penalties. He indicated that he likely completed his SCA during the \nperiod when he was trying to reach the creditor, and his mortgage was not on his mind. \n(Item 3) \nApplicant indicated during his February 2022 background interview that his \nmonthly net income was $5,881, and that his monthly net remainder after expenses was \n$2,173. He indicated that he had assets totaling $1,291,260. He described his financial \nsituation during his background interviews as stable and indicated that he had a budget. \nHe planned to timely pay his debts. He had not received credit counseling. He traveled \nto Ireland for tourism in 2009 and 2019, and to Canada in 2011. (Items 2-3) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government \nmust present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and other \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven \nby Department Counsel, and has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a \nfavorable security decision.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations  \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered as relevant \u00b6 19(a), an \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d \u00b6 19(b), an \n\u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so,\u201d and \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history \nof not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Applicant has a history of not paying his debts \ndespite having the means to do so. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(b), and 19(c) are established. \nOf the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20, I have determined the following to be \nrelevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and, \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control did not contribute to SOR \u00b6 1.a, as \nApplicant admitted that this debt became delinquent due to his own neglect. However, \nsuch conditions contributed to his medical debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a, as he believed his \nmedical insurance paid this debt and he was not billed for it. For the full application of \nAG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Applicant failed to do so. Although he indicated during his background \ninterviews that he intended to contact the creditors to resolve both debts, he did not \nprovide documentation to corroborate his efforts. He has not received financial \ncounseling. His monthly net remainder demonstrates that he has the financial means to \ntake steps toward debt resolution, and yet he has not done so. I find that Applicant\u2019s \nunwillingness to address his debts continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) are not established. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I considered the following relevant: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts \nfrom any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant did not intend to falsify his SCA by failing to disclose SOR \u00b6 1.a and his \npast-due mortgage account. He forgot to set up auto-payments for SOR \u00b6 1.a after the \naccount was transferred to a different servicer, and then he was unaware it was \ndelinquent because he did not receive any notices from the creditor. He did not think \nabout his past-due mortgage when he completed his SCA, as he was unable to follow \nup with his mortgage company\u2019s customer service department during the COVID-19 \npandemic to correct his error for his automatic monthly mortgage payments. I find that \nhe did not deliberately falsify his response to section 26 of his SCA. AG \u00b6 16(a) is not \nestablished. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F and Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. Overall, the \nrecord evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant did not deliberately falsify \nhis SCA, but he did not mitigate the financial considerations security concerns arising \nfrom his delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.g, 2.a, 3.a, 3.b, 5.a, and 5.b. He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.a and 4.a. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 38-year-old systems engineer employed by defense contractors since June 2012. He was unemployed from June to November 2014 when he left a job by mutual agreement after he was accused of making a racial comment to a female servicemember and touching her hair without consent. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from August 2004 to May 2012 and received a general discharge under honorable conditions. Applicant has never married. He lived with a cohabitant from November 2017 to April 2020.

On May 15, 2023, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was \nscheduled to be conducted by video teleconference on June 20, 2023. I convened the \nhearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 13 were admitted in \nevidence without objection.

He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.a and 4.a. His \nadmissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 38-year-old systems engineer employed by defense contractors \nsince June 2012. He was unemployed from June to November 2014 when he left a job \nby mutual agreement after he was accused of making a racial comment to a female \nservicemember and touching her hair without consent. He served on active duty in the \nU.S. Navy from August 2004 to May 2012 and received a general discharge under \nhonorable conditions. \nApplicant has never married. He lived with a cohabitant from November 2017 to \nApril 2020. Before they separated, he and his cohabitant had difficulties due in part to \nhis sexually suggestive text message exchanges with five other women.

(GX 1 at 43-44; \nGX 13 at 2) \nIn January 2003, Applicant was convicted of reckless driving resulting in an \naccident. (GX 11) The accident occurred when he drove too fast around a curve and hit \na guardrail. No other vehicles were involved. He had not been consuming alcohol \nbefore driving.

His blood-alcohol content (BAC) was .24, well above the legal limit. \nHe was fined $350, his driver\u2019s license was suspended for six months, and he was \nrequired to attend alcohol safety classes. (Tr. 59-60; GX 5 at 7-8) \nIn November 2009, Applicant was again convicted of DWI. He was sentenced to \njail for 12 months and five days, all of which was suspended. He was placed on \nunsupervised probation, and his driver\u2019s license was suspended for one year. He was \nrequired to attend alcohol safety classes. (Tr. 60-61; GX 5 at 5) \nIn October 2011, Applicant was charged with DWI, 2nd  offense within five years \nand refusal to submit to a breath test. He was convicted of DWI and sentenced to jail for \n12 months and five days, with 11 months and 15 days suspended. His driver\u2019s license \nwas suspended for 36 months, and he was required to complete alcohol safety classes. \n(GX 5 at 5-6; Tr. 62) Disposition of the charge of refusing to submit to a breath test was \ndeferred and then dismissed in March 2013. (Tr. 66; GX 5 at 6) \nWhile Applicant was in jail, he missed the sailing of his ship, and he received \nnonjudicial punishment for unauthorized absence, missing movement, and violating a \ngeneral order or regulation. (Tr. 64) In May 2012, he received a general discharge \nunder honorable conditions, based on a pattern of misconduct. (GX 1 at 22) \nWhile Applicant was pending discharge from the Navy, he self-referred to the \nNavy Substance Abuse Rehabilitation Program (SARP) and completed a 31-day \ninpatient rehabilitation program. His alcohol use declined after he completed the \nprogram. He stopped drinking between 2014 and 2016. (GX 3 at 4) \nIn June 2014, Applicant was terminated from his job for making a racially \ninsensitive comment to a coworker, an enlisted woman in the Air Force. He considered \nthe coworker a good friend. While off-duty he offered his coworker a drink because he \nhad two drinks in front of him. She declined, and he made a comment that she \ninterpreted as racial profiling. She complained to their supervisor, and he was \nterminated. Applicant disclosed this incident in his SCA as follows: \nFormal complaint regarding professionalism was submitted by Air Force \nmember against me. Terminated by company without being fully \ninvestigated. . . . Formal complaint stated I made racial comments towards \nAir Force member and touched her hair without consent. Air Force \nmember attempted to take complaint back during investigation however \ncompany found it easier to terminate than continue with investigation. \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in January 2021, he \ntold the investigator that he offered his coworker a red fruit punch drink and, when she \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \ndeclined, he told her that everyone loves red fruit punch. (GX 12 at 2). He told the \ninvestigator that he was called into his manager\u2019s office on the following morning and \ntold that he was terminated effective immediately. He told the investigator that his \nemployer did not conduct an investigation because the Air Force member no longer \nworked in the building. However, when the Air Force investigated the incident, they \nfound that the Air Force member\u2019s complaint was \u201cincorrect.\u201d He told the investigator \nthat his employer later determined that the coworker\u2019s complaint was unfounded and \noffered him another job within the company, but he no longer wanted to work for the \ncompany. (GX 12 at 2) The record does not contain any documentation of the complaint \nagainst Applicant, the investigation of that complaint, or the termination of Applicant\u2019s \nemployment. \nIn August 2019, Applicant and his cohabitant hosted a joint birthday party for him \nand her son, which was attended by about 30 guests, including Applicant\u2019s neighbor \nand his neighbor\u2019s granddaughter. The party ended at about 2:00 am. Applicant testified \nthat he consumed three or four beers during the day but did not believe he was \nintoxicated. (Tr. 76) \nApplicant testified that, while cleaning up after the party, he noticed that his \ncohabitant\u2019s son was not in his room, and he could not find him anywhere in the house. \nHe knew that some of the children who had attended the party were spending the night \nin his neighbor\u2019s house. He texted his neighbor, asking if his cohabitant\u2019s son was at the \nneighbor\u2019s house. When the neighbor did not respond to the text, Applicant went to the \nneighbor\u2019s house and knocked on the door, but no one responded. Applicant then \nentered the house through an unlocked back door and asked a friend of the cohabitant\u2019s \nson if he was in the house, and the friend stated that he was \u201cin the back.\u201d Applicant \nlooked in one bedroom, but the cohabitant\u2019s son was not there. He then went to a \nsecond bedroom and saw a person in bed who had blonde hair similar to the son\u2019s hair. \nHe testified that he \u201cjust kind of peeked in,\u201d \u201cmight have had one foot in the door to peek \naround the door,\u201d and softly called out the cohabitant\u2019s son\u2019s name. The neighbor\u2019s \ngranddaughter, who was sleeping in the bed, was startled. He apologized and told the \ngranddaughter that he was looking for his cohabitant\u2019s son, and she responded that the \nson was \u201con the couch.\u201d (Tr. 42-43, 50) He found his cohabitant\u2019s son under some \nblankets. At about this time, the neighbor came out of his bedroom and confronted \nApplicant. Applicant apologized, explained why he was there, and left. \nThe neighbor\u2019s granddaughter called the police and told them that Applicant had \nattempted to kiss her, caressed her hips, and invited her to \u201cdo some coke\u201d with him. \nThe granddaughter also told the police that Applicant had touched her breasts during \nthe party on the previous day. \nApplicant was charged with felony breaking and entering with intent to commit a \nmisdemeanor and sexual battery. He was represented by an attorney at the trial. \nPursuant to a plea agreement, he pleaded guilty to trespassing and assault and battery, \nboth misdemeanors. He was sentenced to one year in jail, suspended for five years, \nconditioned on good behavior, completing a ten-week alcohol-abuse treatment program, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand having no contact with the victim or the victim\u2019s family. He will be on probation until \nNovember 2024. In his answer to the SOR and at the hearing, he admitted trespassing, \nbut he maintained that he was not guilty of the assault and battery and that he pleaded \nguilty to avoid jail time. \nApplicant\u2019s neighbor testified on his behalf at the hearing. His neighbor testified \nthat they continued to have casual contact with each other after the August 2019 \nincident. His neighbor also testified that his granddaughter had several \u201ctraumatic \nissues\u201d in her life and that at the time of the incident, \u201cshe was seeking a lot of attention \nand known to tell fibs.\u201d (Tr. 28) He stopped short of testifying that his granddaughter \nwas lying, but said that he was skeptical about her accusation against Applicant. (Tr. \n28-29, 33-34) \nWhen Applicant was interviewed by a security investigator in January 2021, he \ntold the investigator that before his last DUI, he drank six to twelve beers about four \ntimes a week, but he stopped drinking for two years beginning in 2014. At the time of \nthe interview, he had resuming drinking. He told the investigator that he consumed two \nor three beers about once a week, but that about once a year he drank about six beers \nand became intoxicated. (GX 12 at 3) \nIn November 2021, Applicant underwent a psychological evaluation at the \nrequest of the DOD CAF. The evaluation was conducted by video teleconference. The \npsychologist noted that he \u201cpresented in this evaluation with a moderately antisocial \nmanner,\u201d \u201cappeared to minimize his responsibility in the problem situations described in \nhis background information,\u201d and \u201cblamed others in instances that appeared to be \nmatters of his own lack of behavioral control.\u201d The psychologist concluded that \nApplicant attempted to mislead him about the details of past events to cast himself in a \nmore positive light than may have been warranted by his actions. \nApplicant told the psychologist that he suffered an estimated 20 instances of \nbroken bones in his lifetime, engaging in sky diving, riding an off-road four-wheeler, \nplaying basketball, and being punched in the face. (GX 3 at 3) At the hearing, he \nadmitted that he has always been a high-energy, adventuresome person. (Tr. 51) \nThe psychologist found that if Applicant entered his neighbor\u2019s home for the \npurpose of sexual encounter with the neighbor\u2019s granddaughter, and touched her and \nconfined her in her room for a time, particularly if he was intoxicated, \u201cthen this act \nwould represent a nexus between his alcohol use problems, antisocial style, impulsivity, \nand stimulus seeking tendencies.\u201d He diagnosed Applicant with \u201calcohol-use disorder, \nsevere, in sustained remission (by subject report).\u201d He suggested the following as \n\u201cdiagnostic \npossibilities,\u201d \nstopping \nshort \nof \na \nformal \ndiagnosis: \nattention \ndeficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), predominately hyperactive/impulsive presentation; \nand other specified personality disorder (with features of antisocial personality disorder). \nThe psychologist concluded that Applicant\u2019s ADHD symptoms and a history of \nalcohol use did not present a significant risk to his reliability, trustworthiness, and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \njudgment, but that \u201chis personality condition certainly could contribute to a lack of \ntrustworthiness in safeguarding national security information.\u201d The psychologist \nconcluded that Applicant\u2019s prognosis \u201cis uncertain given that he did not seem to be \nentirely forthright with [him].\u201d (GX 3 at 9) \nThe psychologist listed the following examples of inconsistencies in information \nprovided by Applicant that suggested a lack of candor: \n\u2022 Applicant told him that he could not remember when he last drank \nmore than three beers, but he told an investigator in 2021 that he \ndrinks six or more beers and becomes intoxicated once a year. \n\u2022 Applicant used the term \u201cretired\u201d to describe his departure from the \nNavy even though he was discharged for misconduct. \n\u2022 Applicant said that he \u201cleft\u201d a job in 2014 when in fact he was \nterminated because of a racially related comment, and he provided \nan exculpatory explanation of the event, when the records reflected \nthat he \u201cvery likely\u201d made racially offensive remarks. \n \n \n\u2022 Applicant pleaded guilty to a crime but told the psychologist that he \ndid not sexually assault the victim. \n\u2022 Applicant told him that he had consumed some alcohol but was not \nintoxicated on the night of the alleged sexual assault in 2019. \nThe psychologist\u2019s conclusion that Applicant was not \u201centirely forthright\u201d appears \nto be based on the psychologist\u2019s conclusion that all the allegations against Applicant \nprobably were supported by the evidence. While Applicant\u2019s guilty pleas at his trial \nwould justify a conclusion that he trespassed into his neighbor\u2019s home and touched the \nneighbor\u2019s granddaughter, the psychologist apparently believed that Applicant groped \nhis neighbor\u2019s granddaughter at the party, touched her inappropriately after he entered \nhis neighbor\u2019s house, looking for his cohabitant\u2019s son, and invited her to \u201cdo coke\u201d with \nhim. The civil authorities did not charge Applicant with groping the granddaughter or \noffering cocaine to her, and these acts were not alleged in the SOR. \nThe psychologist also appeared to believe that Applicant made an inappropriate \nremark to a coworker that caused him to be fired. The psychologist stated in his report \nthat he was told by Applicant\u2019s mother that he made a comment such as \u201call black \npeople like Kool-Aid.\u201d (GX 3 at 3) There is no statement from Applicant\u2019s mother in the \nrecord. There is no record of the investigation of the complaint.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

It further \nalleges that he pleaded guilty to \u201cunlawful entry/trespassing\u201d and assault and battery \nand was sentenced to one year in jail, suspended for five years conditioned on good \nbehavior, successfully completing probation, successfully completing an alcohol-abuse \nprogram, and having no contact with the victim and staying away from her residence \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a). It also alleges three incidents of driving while intoxicated (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, \nand 1.d), two incidents of reckless driving (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f), and one incident of \nunderage possession of alcohol (SOR \u00b6 1.g). \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d The following disqualifying conditions are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own \nwould be unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which \nin combination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, \nan admission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, \nregardless of whether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or \nconvicted; and \nAG \u00b6 31(c): individual is currently on parole or probation. \nAG \u00b6 31(a) is established for some of Applicant\u2019s early traffic offenses, each of \nwhich, standing alone, would be unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, \nbut when considered together show a pattern of irresponsible behavior. Applicant\u2019s \noverall criminal record establishes AG \u00b6 31(b), and his probation until November 2024, \nimposed for the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, establishes AG \u00b6 31(c). \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \nAG \u00b6 32(c): no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed \nthe offense; and \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but \nnot limited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) are not established for the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nAlthough the conduct occurred almost four years ago, it was a continuation of a long \npattern of impulsive and irresponsible behavior. Applicant has been on probation and \nunder the pressure of retaining his security clearance since his arrest in August 2019. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d) are established for the criminal conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.b-1.g, all of which were alcohol-related. Applicant stopped drinking for two years, from \n2014 to 2016, drank moderately until 2018, and stopped drinking in July 2022. He is \nhighly regarded by coworkers and supervisors for his technical expertise, dedication, \nand reliability. He is highly respected as a father by friends as neighbors, and he is \ninvolved in his community as a baseball coach. \nAG \u00b6 32(c) is established for the allegation of sexual battery alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.a. The alleged victim\u2019s credibility was judged by her grandfather as questionable, and \nthe alleged victim\u2019s accusation was undermined by her unsupported and incredible \nassertion that Applicant invited her to use cocaine. \nI have considered whether the doctrine of collateral estoppel applies to\nApplicant\u2019s testimony at the hearing that he did not sexually touch his neighbor\u2019s \ngranddaughter. The doctrine of collateral estoppel generally applies in DOHA hearings \nand precludes applicants from contending that they did not engage in criminal acts for \nwhich they were convicted. ISCR Case No. 95-0817 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Feb. 21, 1997). \nThere are exceptions to this general rule, especially with respect to misdemeanor \nconvictions based on guilty pleas. Relying on federal case law, the Appeal Board has \nadopted a three-part test to determine the appropriateness of applying collateral \nestoppel to misdemeanor convictions. First, the applicant must have been afforded a full \nand fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the criminal trial. Second, the issues \npresented for collateral estoppel must be the same as those resolved against the \napplicant in the criminal trial. Third, the application of collateral estoppel must not result \nin \u201cunfairness,\u201d such as where the circumstances indicate lack of incentive to litigate the \nissues in the original trial. ISCR Case No. 04-05712, (App. Bd. Oct. 31, 2006).\n \n \nDepartment Counsel did not assert collateral estoppel during the hearing. \nApplicant was represented by counsel at his criminal trial and had an opportunity to fully \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nlitigate the issues. His plea of guilty to assault and battery was a tactical decision, based \non advice of counsel, to avoid the possibility of a jail sentence. His conviction, based on \nhis guilty pleas, establishes only that he entered his neighbor\u2019s house without \npermission and touched the granddaughter. It does not establish that he fondled or \nkissed her on the night in question, that he groped her on the preceding day, or that he \ninvited her to \u201cdo some coke\u201d with him. \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions \nThe SOR \u00b6 2.a alleges that Applicant was evaluated by a licensed psychologist \nin March 2022 and diagnosed with alcohol use, severe, in sustained remission, attention \ndeficit/hyperactivity disorder, predominantly hyperactive/impulsive presentation; and \nother specified personality disorder, with features of antisocial personality disorder. It \nalso alleges that the psychologist opined that his prognosis was uncertain because of \nhis lack of forthrightness during the evaluation. Finally, it alleges that the psychologist \nconcluded that Applicant\u2019s personality condition could contribute to a lack of \ntrustworthiness in safeguarding national security information. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a is partially established by the psychologist\u2019s diagnosis of alcohol use, \nsevere, in sustained remission. It is not established for the other psychological \nconditions alleged, because the psychologist suggested them as \u201cdiagnostic \npossibilities\u201d but stopped short of a formal diagnosis. \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling. \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline may be applicable: \nAG \u00b6 28(a): behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, \nstability, reliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other \nguideline and that may indicate an emotional, mental, or personality \ncondition, including, but not limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, \nsuicidal, paranoid, manipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, \nexploitative, or bizarre behaviors; and \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 28(b): an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that \nthe individual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 28(a) and 28(b) are established by the psychologist\u2019s report and \nApplicant\u2019s admissions. The psychologist concluded that Applicant\u2019s alcohol use \ndisorder was in sustained remission, and this conclusion is supported by Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony as well as the testimony of family members, professional colleagues, \nneighbors and friends. The psychologist stopped short of a formal diagnosis of any \nother disorders, but Applicant admitted that he suffers from and receives treatment for \nADHD, anxiety, and panic disorder. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 29(a): the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, \nand the individual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance \nwith the treatment plan; \nAG \u00b6 29(b): the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or \ntreatment program for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the \nindividual is currently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable \nprognosis by a duly qualified mental health professional; \nAG \u00b6 29(c): recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that \nan individual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has \na low probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \nAG \u00b6 29(e): there is no indication of a current problem. \nAG \u00b6 29(a) is established. Applicant\u2019s alcohol use and impulsive behavior are \ncontrollable. He is receiving counseling and he is complying with his medication \nprogram. \nAG \u00b6 29(b) is not fully established. While Applicant has sought and obtained \ntreatment, he has not provided evidence of a favorable prognosis. \nAG \u00b6 29(c) is established for his alcohol use disorder, which the psychologist \nfound to be in sustained remission. The psychologist declined to make a prognosis for \nApplicant\u2019s other behavior, in large part because he did not believe Applicant was \ntruthful. Unfortunately, the psychologist\u2019s belief that Applicant was untruthful was based \nin part on his own conclusions, unsupported by the evidence in the record, that \nApplicant was terminated from employment for making a racist comment and that he \nprobably was guilty of sexual misconduct with an 18-year-old young woman. \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 29(e) is not established.

His colleagues and supervisors have confidence in his \ntechnical skills and his apparent changes in behavior and attitude. However, he \nadmitted at the hearing that he still suffers from panic attacks and depression. \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant was under the influence of alcohol during the \nconduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a (SOR \u00b6 3.a) and cross-alleges the conduct alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.g, and 2.a (SOR \u00b6 3.b). The concern under this guideline is set \nout in AG \u00b6 21: \u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of \nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving \nwhile under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the \npeace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the \nindividual's alcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with \nalcohol use disorder; \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of \nimpaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with \nalcohol use disorder; and \nAG \u00b6 22(d): diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health \nprofessional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed \nclinical social worker) of alcohol use disorder. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to \nrecur or does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or judgment; \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive \nalcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23(c): the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment \nprogram, has no previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making \nsatisfactory progress in a treatment program; and \nAG \u00b6 23(d): the individual has successfully completed a treatment \nprogram along with any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear \nand established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in \naccordance with treatment recommendations. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a) and 23(b) are established. Applicant\u2019s last alcohol-related incident \nwas in October 2011. Although it was alleged that Applicant was under the influence of \nalcohol when the incident in August 2019 occurred, that allegation was not supported by \nthe evidence. Applicant reduced his alcohol consumption when his son was born in \n2018, and he decided to totally abstain from alcohol in July 2022. \nAG \u00b6 23(c) is not established. Although Applicant is receiving regular counseling \nand treatment, it is focused on his behavioral disorders and not on alcohol consumption. \nAG \u00b6 23(d) is established. Applicant was required to complete an alcohol-abuse \nprogram as a condition of his probation imposed in November 2019. He completed the \nprogram, modified his consumption, and has abstained from alcohol since July 2022. \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \nSOR \u00b6 4.a cross-alleges the conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. The concern under \nthis guideline is set out in AG 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 13(a): sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the \nindividual has been prosecuted; \nAG \u00b6 13(b): pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high-risk sexual \nbehavior that the individual is unable to stop; \n15 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 13(c): sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and \nAG \u00b6 13(d): sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of \ndiscretion or judgment. \nNo disqualifying conditions under this guideline are established. Applicant\u2019s plea \nof guilty was to assault and battery. He did not plead guilty to a sexual offense. The \nalleged victim\u2019s credibility was judged by her grandfather as questionable, and the \nalleged victim\u2019s accusation was undermined by her unsupported and incredible\nassertion that Applicant invited her to use cocaine. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant was terminated from employment in June 2014 \nfor making an inappropriate comment to a coworker (SOR \u00b6 5.a), and that he was \nadministratively separated from the Navy with a general discharge under honorable \nconditions for misconduct (SOR \u00b6 5.b), and it cross-alleges the conduct alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.g (SOR \u00b6 5.c). \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \u201cConduct \ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. . . .\u201d The \nfollowing disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable in this case: \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue \nareas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other \nsingle guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a \nwhole-person assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \nAG \u00b6 16(d): credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered \nunder any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available \ninformation, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that \nthe individual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. This includes, but is not limited to, consideration of . . . any \ndisruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior . . . ; and \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or \n16 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nduress by a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such \nconduct includes . . . engaging in activities which, if known, could affect \nthe person's personal, professional, or community standing. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16(c) and 16(d) are not applicable. The SOR alleges multiple incidents that \nare specifically covered by Guidelines J, I, and G that would be sufficient, if supported \nby substantial evidence, for an adverse determination. \nAG \u00b6 16(e) is established. Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct and alcohol abuse, if \nknown, could affect his personal, professional, and community standing. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur; \nAG \u00b6 17(e): the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \nAG \u00b6 17(f): the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of \nquestionable reliability. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c), 17(d), and 17(f) are established for Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related \nconduct. His last alcohol-related incident was in October 2011. He reduced his alcohol \nconsumption in 2018, when his son was born, and he decided to abstain from alcohol in \nJuly 2022. These mitigating conditions are also established for his discharge from the \nNavy, which occurred 21 years ago and was based on his alcohol-related conduct. They \nare not established for Applicant\u2019s impulsive and irresponsible behavior, including his \ntrespassing into his neighbor\u2019s home. Although the last incident was in August 2019, he \nis still on probation for that conduct. \nAG \u00b6 17(f) is applicable to the allegation that Applicant was terminated from \nemployment in June 2014. The investigation into the allegation determined that it was \nunfounded, and Applicant was offered another job by the same employer. \n17 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines J, I, G, and E in my whole-\nperson analysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant was \nsincere, candid, and credible at the hearing. He admitted his misconduct, except for the \nallegation of sexual behavior with the 18-year-old granddaughter of his former neighbor. \nBased on the testimony of the 18-year-old\u2019s grandfather and the unsupported \nsuggestion that Applicant was involved with cocaine, I found his denial of sexual contact \ncredible. \nHowever, I share the psychologist\u2019s concern that Applicant\u2019s past conduct and \npersonality raise concerns about future impulsive and irresponsible behavior. \u201cOnce a \nconcern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong \npresumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n09-01652 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2011), citing Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 \n(9th  Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). Applicant has not overcome that \npresumption. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines \nJ, I, G, and E, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns under Guideline G and refuted \nthe allegations under Guideline D, but he has not mitigated the security concerns under \nGuidelines J, I, and E. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n18 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.g: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline I, (Psychological Conditions): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a and 3.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline D (Sexual Behavior): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 4.a \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 5, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 5.a and 5.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 5.c: \nAgainst Applicant as to \nSubparagraph 1.a; for \nApplicant as to \nsubparagraphs 1.b-1.g \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

There are ten student loan accounts, and the remaining accounts are commercial and one medical account. The total amount of debt is about $70,841. Applicant admitted the delinquent accounts except SOR \u00b6 1.m, explaining that he was making payments to this collection agency. He denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1q and 1.r, explaining that he completed the 2020 federal and state tax returns and was waiting on information concerning the other listed years.

Eligibility for \nsecurity clearance access is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 30, 2020, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to retain his security clearance required for a position \nwith a defense contractor. On May 28, 2020, he provided a personal subject interview \n(PSI) to an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Services \n(CAS) could not make the affirmative findings required to continue a security clearance, \nand issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated August 19, 2022, \ndetailing security concerns raised by financial considerations (Guideline F). The action \nwas taken under DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) effective in the DOD on June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant provided his answer on August 23, 2022.

Guideline G: Excessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of \nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. Three allegations under this guideline are: \n2.a.

He has never been married. He received his high \nschool diploma in 2006. He has been living with a roommate since October 2019 (GE 1 \nat 25) \nAccording to his March 2020 security clearance application, Applicant has been \nemployed as a functional analyst since March 2020.

From \nAugust 2006 to August 2017, Applicant was an Honor Guard Specialist in the State \nNational Guard and a clerk in the Army Guard Reserve. (GE 1 at 12-20) He provided \ninformation about his two DUI misdemeanor convictions in 2015 (GE 1 at 34-39) and \nnot filing his state tax returns for 2013 through 2020. He did not mention his missing \nfederal tax returns which he did not file for the same period. See GE 1 at 43. He \nrecalled being investigated for a security clearance while he was in the National Guard \n(2007 to 2015), and received a security clearance but does not recall when. (GE 1 at \n41) \nFinancial Considerations \nThe record evidence indicates that Applicant\u2019s financial problems began when he \nstopped filing his income tax returns in 2013. He indicated that he could no longer afford \nto pay his tax preparer. He exacerbated his financial troubles by accumulating two DUI \noffenses in 2015, then one more in April 2023.

(GE 3 at 12-14) Regarding the delinquent student loan accounts, \nApplicant testified that he was in discussions with lawyers who informed him that the \nschool (where he was receiving his education in 2008 and 2009) lost their accreditation. \nApplicant learned that the school was charging military personnel more than other \nenrollees. He implied that a large amount of time had passed since 2008 because he \nhad repeatedly placed the student loans in forbearance to allow him additional time to \naccumulate enough money to repay the loans. (Tr. 22-24) Since he opened the loan \naccounts, he has made approximately $100 in payments towards repayment of the \nloans.

He got lost and drove the wrong way \non a street.

He was charged with DUI at the police station. Before his court \nappearance, he completed 10 to 15 Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings and had \npoints taken away from his driver\u2019s license. He received probation before judgment. (GE \n2 at 4) \nWhile fulfilling the conditions of the June 2015 DUI, Applicant was arrested a \nsecond time for the same offense in September 2015. (SOR \u00b6 2b) He had consumed \none or two mixed drinks while celebrating the return of a friend from overseas. During \nhis drive to pick up his friend, he hit another car in the rear. Applicant failed the breath \ntest administered by a police officer and was arrested for DUI. When asked why he was \ndriving, Applicant replied, \u201cI was not thinking.\u201d (GE 2 at 4-5) He entered inpatient \ntreatment for three days; then he attended 26 weeks of AA. He received a certification \nfor the inpatient treatment and AA attendance. He returned to court on May 3, 2016, \nand received a 20-day sentence, which he completed by serving 10 weekends in jail. \nHe was put on probation for one year and his driver\u2019s license was suspended until \nFebruary 2017.

(SOR \u00b6 2.b) (GE 2 \nat 5) He was separated from his State National Guard job in August 2017 for the SOR \u00b6 \n2.b DUI in September 2015, and he received a General Discharge from the National \nGuard in August 2017. (GE 2 at 4; Tr. 50) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(d) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18. Failure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of \nincome is also a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal \nactivity, including espionage. \n6 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local tax as \nrequired. \nAdverse evidence from credit reports can usually meet the Government\u2019s \nobligation of proving delinquent debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02403 at 3 (App. \nBd. Aug. 18, 2015); ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) The \nGovernment credit reports establish that all the debts listed in the SOR have been \ndelinquent since between March 2016 and July 2019. In March 2020, May 2020, April \n2022, and June 2023, Applicant was placed on notice that his financial delinquencies \nand his repeated failure to file his federal and state tax returns from 2013 through 2020 \nraised serious concerns to the Government. As of the close of the record on July 21, \n2023, the only documented account that Applicant paid was one account under SOR \u00b6 \n1.m. Though the other SOR \u00b6 1.m account became a judgment, followed by \ngarnishment of Appellant\u2019s wages. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. AG \u00b6 19(b) applies \nbecause of Applicant\u2019s lack of documented action in addressing 15 of the remaining 16 \ndelinquent accounts listed in the SOR. AG \u00b6 19(f) applies based on the lack of \ndocumentation that indicates that Applicant has filed the missing federal and state tax \nreturns.  \nAG \u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n7 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20 (a) does not apply since Applicant still owes more than $65,000 \nto 15 creditors or collection agencies. With no discernible changes in his financial \npractices, they will probably continue into the future. Applicant\u2019s failure to take \ncharge of his delinquent debt responsibilities continues to raise doubts about his \nreliability and judgment. \nNo mitigation is available for Applicant under AG \u00b6 20(b). He has had \nuninterrupted employment since 2007. When he stopped filing his federal and state tax \nreturns in 2013, he was working as an Honor Guard with the State National Guard and \nhe was also employed as an Army clerk for the Guard. He may not have been paid the \nlevel of wages that he was entitled, but he should have made the appropriate \nadjustments to his finances so he could continue to dutifully file his tax returns as \nrequired under the United States (US) Tax Code, while handling his other delinquent \ndebts. By not acting responsibly under the circumstances to address his financial \nissues, AG \u00b6 20(b) cannot be applied under these circumstances. \nWhen an applicant is having problems in paying his debts in a timely manner, \nhe should seek help through some kind of financial counseling. Based on the lack of \nfinancial counseling or evidence of a written budget to monitor his earnings and \nexpenditures, both the first and second prongs of AG \u00b6 20(c) must be removed from \nfavorable consideration. Fifteen of Applicant\u2019s 16 delinquent debts are not being \nresolved or under control. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply because Applicant is not engaged \nin a good-faith effort to repay his creditors. Though Applicant is paying off the second \ncreditor through garnishment, at least the creditor is receiving some reimbursement for \nhaving initially advanced him credit in good faith. SOR \u00b6 1.m is found in Applicant\u2019s \nfavor. \nAlcohol Consumption \nThe security concerns of the guideline for alcohol consumption are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of \nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness.  \n8 \n\n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; and \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nBetween 2015 and April 2023, Applicant was convicted of three DUI offenses. \nBefore each of the three alcohol-related incidents, Applicant had consumed up to three \nmixed drinks. During the first incident in June 2015, Applicant became lost and found \nhimself driving the wrong way. Initially, he was stopped for an expired emissions sticker. \nWhile he was completing the terms of his sentence for the first DUI, after consuming at \nleast two mixed drinks, Applicant struck another car from behind in September 2015. He \nwas arrested and charged with DUI. In April 2023, while consuming three mixed drinks \nas he was watching a boxing match at a friend\u2019s house, Applicant decided to drive \nhome. Feeling too tired to continue his trip, he stopped on the side of the road. Not \nrealizing how far off the road he was, his efforts to get the car in a more stable position \nwere futile and the car slid into a ditch. AG \u00b6 22(a) applies because of the three alcohol-\nrelated incidents. AG \u00b6 22(c) applies because of the impaired judgment which Applicant \nexhibited in the three alcohol-related incidents, even though there has been no \ndiagnosis of an alcohol use disorder. \nAG \u00b6 23 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations. \nAG \u00b6 23(a) does not apply because less than four months has passed since \nApplicant\u2019s most recent DUI. The alcohol-related incident did not occur under unusual \ncircumstances because it had happened on two previous occasions. Applicant lost his \n9 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndriver\u2019s license for a year following his second DUI in September 2015. In August 2017, \nhe received a General Discharge from the Maryland National Guard as a result of his \nsecond DUI in September 2015. The recency of the April 2023 alcohol-related incident \ncontinues to cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability.  \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b) does not apply. Though Applicant testified that he has been \nabstinent since his April 2023 DUI arrest, he has failed to convince me that he has \ndiscontinued his alcohol consumption. He has presented insufficient evidence \ndemonstrating changed circumstances conducive of an alcohol-free lifestyle. His \ncommitment to AA is minimal. While he indicates he has been investigating therapy, he \nis still not enrolled in any program. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the specific guidelines in the context of the \nnine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nIn Guideline F cases, the DOHA Appeal Board has repeatedly held that, to \nestablish his case in mitigation, an applicant must present a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of \ndebt repayments that result in debt reduction. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-01920 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007) While an applicant is not required to show that every debt listed \nin the SOR is paid, the applicant must show that he has a plan for debt resolution and \nhas taken significant action to implement the plan. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-25499 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2006) From the record presented, Applicant has no plan in place \nand has furnished no evidence of even sporadic payments on 15 of the 16 past due \naccounts. After a full review of the entire record from an overall common-sense point of \nview, Applicant\u2019s ongoing financial problems have not been mitigated.  \nApplicant has not mitigated the alcohol consumption guideline either.

The Government\u2019s \nevidence is identified as Items 1 through 9. Applicant did not object to any of the Items \nand they are admitted in evidence. Applicant provided responses to the FORM and \ndocuments that are marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A though G. There were no \nobjections, and they are admitted in evidence. The case was assigned to me on May 1, \n2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6 1.a and 2.a. He denied the SOR \nallegation in \u00b6 1.b. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits \nsubmitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 60 years old. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2000 and a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2003. He married in 1993 and has two children, ages 30 and 28. He \nhas worked for his present employer, a federal contractor, since January 2017. \nThe SOR alleges delinquent student loans (\u00b6 1.a $43,614) and a delinquent credit \ncard (\u00b6 1.b $1,586) that are substantiated by Applicant\u2019s admissions in the SOR, during \nhis interview with a government investigator, and credit reports from January 2021 and \nFebruary 2023. (Items 3, 5, 6, 9) \nIn August 2021, based on information obtained through the DOD Continuous \nEvaluation Program, DOD sent Applicant\u2019s employer a supplemental information request, \nrequiring Applicant to complete a current Questionnaire for Investigation Processing (e-\nQIP). He completed it in August 2021. (Item 6) \nSection 26 of the e-QIP asked if Applicant, in the past seven years, had defaulted \non any type of loan; had bills or debts turned over to a collection agency; or had been \nover 120 delinquent on any debt not previously included in the e-QIP. He responded \u201cno\u201d \nto all those questions. (Item 4) \nIn September 2021, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. \nWhen asked if he had any debts in collection, he responded that he did not. He was then \nconfronted with collection accounts for student loans and a credit card. He explained to \nthe investigator that he had no knowledge of the debts, and his wife handled all of the \nfinances. He did acknowledge that he opened a student loan account in his name for the \nbenefit of his daughter with the Department of Education. He was given an opportunity to \nprovide additional documents and information after he spoke with his wife. He was also \ngiven a financial worksheet to complete. (Item 5) \nApplicant contacted the investigator the next day by email and stated he and his \nwife did not feel they needed to complete the financial worksheet because they are not at \nfault. He also stated he was willing to pay the correct amount of the student loan. \nHowever, he did not agree with the loan term \u201cconsolidated loans.\u201d He then went on to \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsay that the borrower had the right to cancel if there was not a good option. It is unclear \nwhat this statement means. (Item 5) \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he provided a letter from the student loan \ncreditor from January 2018, which stated that the consolidated application from Applicant \nwas canceled on October 27, 2017. However, the creditor received an email from \nApplicant on November 14, 2017, to continue the process of consolidation. Applicant\u2019s \napplication was reinstated effective November 15, 2017, and the creditor disbursed the \nfunds on November 22, 2017. The creditor explained it did not receive another request to \ncancel the consolidation request until November 23, 2017. It stated in its letter: \nUnfortunately, we were not able to cancel your Direct Consolidation Loan \nsince the consolidation process had been complete and loan was disbursed \non November 22, 2017. Once the consolidation is complete, we are unable \nto \u201cunconsolidated\u201d the loan. (AE B) \nIn October 2018, Applicant filed a complaint with the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau against the DOE Office of Federal Student Aid. He provided a copy of \nan email received in February 2020 noting they were working on his complaint. (Item 3) \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he stated that he contacted the student loan \nprovider on November 23, 2017, to cancel the application for the loan due to a \nmisunderstanding. He said the application was submitted on November 14, 2017, and he \nhad ten days to make a change to the application, but his request for a change was \n\u201cunreasonably\u201d rejected. (AE A) \nApplicant\u2019s February 2023 credit report reflects that he had several student loans \nthat were acquired from 2011 through 2013. Applicant made payments on these loans \nand then in November 2017 they were refinanced. It appears this is when they were also \nconsolidated. After that time, it appears he may have made some payments, but it is \nunclear. He did not provide any information on payments he previously made or why he \nmay have changed the status of the loan. At some point, he stopped paying them and \nthey went to collection. (Item 9) \nRegarding the credit card debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b, in Applicant\u2019s subsequent email to \nthe investigator after his September 2021 interview, he stated that he had paid the creditor \n$5,000, and he and his wife did not agree with the interest that was charged, believing it \nwas an overcharge. (Item 5) \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he provided a copy of an email from October \n2018 that he sent to the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.b. He told the creditor that the amount of \ninterest charged was incorrect and that he had previously contacted them in December \n2017 requesting a corrected statement, but his request was ignored. He stated: \u201cThis [is] \nmy last message to you please stop contacting me.\u201d (Item 5) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he stated the amount alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b \nwas incorrect due to an overcharge for interest on the credit card, and he had paid the \ncredit card debt in full. He said the interest rate agreement was for 9.9% and he was \ncharged up to 15%. No documents were provided. His credit report from February 2023 \nreflects the debt has been delinquent since January 2018 and remains unpaid. (AE A) \nApplicant stated in his FORM response that he was willing to repay the student \nloan, (Sugg. I think \u201cloan debt\u201d is a bit redundant.) but the payments have been paused \ndue to the pandemic. He stated he intended to start repayment when the program \nreopens. (AE E) \nApplicant provided an email from November 2022 from Miguel Cardona, U.S. \nSecretary of Education regarding the student loan debt relief program and noted that \nApplicant was eligible for relief. However, the legality of program was challenged. He may \nbe eligible under a new program. If approved, part of Applicant\u2019s student loans will be \ndischarged. (AE F) \nApplicant provided a DOE email noting that the pause on payments for student \nloans was extended through the end of June 2023 so those who qualified for debt relief \nwould not have to make payments when their loans may be forgiven. (AE G) \nApplicant provided a letter in his FORM response from his wife stating he does not \nknow anything about their finances. She handles all financial matters. (AE E) He stated: \nSince in the past to on August 2021, I did not know any financial in family. \nMy wife, [LL], she took care and handled anything in finance. Until \ninvestigator my security clearance let me know about the debts. (AE E) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has delinquent student loans and a credit card debt totaling \napproximately $45,200 that he has been aware of since at least 2018 and has not paid. \nAlthough, he may dispute the consolidation of the loans, the evidence is clear that the \nmoney from the student loan creditor was disbursed and presumably used for Applicant\u2019s \ndaughter\u2019s education. He refused to provide any information about his finances to make \na determination if he was unable to pay his debts. There is no evidence either debt is \npaid.

The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant provided a series of statements about the student loans that were \nconsolidated in 2017. He admitted the debt in his SOR answer; however it appears he \nhas an ongoing dispute about the loans, but the specifics of the dispute are unclear. He \nfailed to provide sufficient documents to substantiate why he is not responsible for the \ndebt. He provided a letter from the creditor clearly spelling out the timeline and his failure \nto act within the time requirements. He did not provide substantiating documents to show \nthe borrower could cancel if there was \u201cnot a good option.\u201d It is unclear what the statement \nmeans or where it came from. He did not provide any evidence of actions he has taken \nto pay this debt since becoming aware it was a security concern in 2021. He did provide \nthat he has applied for student loan debt relief, and if the program is implemented then \nhis \u201capproved debt\u201d would be discharged. He did not provide evidence of the amount of \nhis approved debt. However, it appears that the maximum amount under the program \nwould be $20,000. He said that he intended to pay his student loans when the forbearance \nis over. \nApplicant denied he owed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b. Although, he stated he was \novercharged for interest, he did not provide any documents to show what the contractually \nagreed upon interest rate was, proof that he paid $5,000 to the creditor, or how long the \ndebt was delinquent. He provided a 2018 email he sent to the creditor advising them he \ndisputed the interest rate and told them to not contact him again. There is no evidence he \nhas contacted the creditor and resolved or satisfactorily disputed the debt. It remains on \nhis 2023 credit report. \nApplicant may rely on a potential student loan debt relief program to address a \nportion of his delinquent loans, but his failure to act upon them before they went to \ncollection or take any meaningful action since becoming aware they are a security \nconcerns raises questions about whether future behavior is unlikely to recur. I am not \nconvinced it will not recur and find his conduct casts doubt on his reliability and good \njudgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nThere is no evidence Applicant participated in financial counseling. He refused to \ncomplete a financial worksheet reflecting his current financial obligations and assets, so \nthe evidence is insufficient to conclude that there are clear indications his finances are \nunder control or his financial problems are being resolved. There is no evidence he has \ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay the creditors. \nApplicant admitted the student loan in SOR \u00b6 1.a but then provided a series of \nstatements regarding the validity of the loan.

What is clear is that he received a disbursement for over $43,000 \nand the debt is in collection. He did not provide a reasonable basis of a legitimate dispute \nor actions to resolve it. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nApplicant denied and disputed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b. He provided a document he \nsent to the creditor in 2018 that said he did not agree with the interest that was charged \nand told the creditor to stop contacting him. He failed to contact the creditor and resolve \nthe debt. He did not provide documented proof to substantiate the basis of his dispute. \nHe did not provide a copy of his agreement with the creditor with the interest rate, or proof \nthat he paid $5,000 and that satisfied the debt. AG \u00b6 20(e) does not apply to this debt. \nInsufficient evidence was provided to apply any of the other mitigating conditions. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nApplicant admitted SOR \u00b6 2.a, which alleged he intentionally falsified his response \nto section 26 of the e-QIP which asked if he had any debts in collection. In his FORM \nresponse, he said his wife handles all financial matters and he did not know about the \ndebts. \nApplicant provided documentation that he was involved in communicating with the \nDOE and the credit-card creditor. He applied for a student loan consolidation through \nDOE and communicated to them regarding the possibility of canceling the loan and then \nsubsequently filed a complaint regarding the loan. He also provided a document that \nreflected he contacted the credit-card creditor regarding the interest that was being \ncharged on his account. He acknowledged that he had received and reviewed \ncommunications from the creditor and told them not to contact him again. Applicant was \nactively handling and disputing the accounts in the SOR. I did not find Applicant\u2019s \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nstatements credible and find he deliberately failed to disclose his delinquent debts in his \ne-QIP. AG \u00b6 16(a) applies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom personal conduct. I have considered the following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n17: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nApplicant did not correct his response to the e-QIP. He was interviewed by a \ngovernment investigator and denied he had any delinquent debts. AG 17(a) does not \napply. Failing to be honest on an e-QIP is not minor. The cornerstone of the security \nclearance process is that the Government trusts those who are granted security \nclearances to be honest and self-report issues or conduct even when no one is looking. \nApplicant failed to do that. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F and Guideline E in my whole-person analysis. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nApplicant did not provide sufficient documentation to support his claims. He failed \nto meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns raised under \nGuideline F, financial considerations and Guideline E, personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs   1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n10 \n",

Department Counsel was ready \nto proceed with the hearing on April 17, 2023. The case was assigned to me on April 19, \n2023. The Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Notice of Video \nTeleconference Hearing on April 24, 2023, scheduling the hearing for June 27, 2023. The \ncase was heard as scheduled. \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel offered 13 exhibits marked as Government\nExhibits (GE) 1 through 13, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on\nhis own behalf and submitted 29 exhibits marked as Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through\nCC. All of Applicant\u2019s exhibits were admitted without objection. The day after the hearing,\nApplicant submitted a request to reopen the record to permit him to submit documents in\nresponse to an issue that arose during the hearing. Department Counsel objected to this\nrequest. In an email identified as Hearing Exhibit (Hearing Ex.) I, I overruled the objection\nand granted Applicant the opportunity to submit additional proposed exhibits on or before\nJuly 5, 2023. I granted Department Counsel the opportunity to object to or comment on\nany additional proposed exhibits submitted by Applicant. (Hearing Transcript at 11.)   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn June 30, 2023, Applicant submitted five proposed exhibits, marked for \nidentification purposes as AE DD through HH. Department Counsel objected to the \nproposed exhibits on the grounds of relevance. The documents are news and journal \narticles that were unrelated to any of the specific SOR allegations but related more \ngenerally to an issue raised by Applicant during the hearing. My evidentiary ruling on the \nAE DD through HH is discussed below. The correspondence relating to Applicant\u2019s post-\nhearing submission has been marked as Hearing Ex. II through IV. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 5, 2023, and the record closed on that date. (Tr. at \n9-19, 64-65; Hearing Ex. II through IV.) \nEvidentiary Ruling \nAs stated, Department Counsel objected to the admission of AE DD through HH. \nThe proposed exhibits consist of two news articles (AE DD and EE), two articles that \nappeared in university publications (AE GG and HH), and a privately funded report that \nwas published on an internet website (AE FF) (collectively referred to as the Publications). \nApplicant has not requested that I take administrative notice of the facts appearing in the \nPublications. Instead, he offers the Publications as evidence. Department Counsel \ncorrectly notes that as evidence, the articles bear little relevance to the particular facts in \nthis case. None of the Publications discuss Applicant\u2019s arrest in March 2019 for assault \nand resisting arrest (SOR \u00b6 1.a), any of the charges that were prosecuted in Applicant\u2019s \nJune 2012 court-martial (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c through 1.e), or his arrest for abusive sexual conduct \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b).

(AE DD through HH.) \nThe facts found below under SOR \u00b6 1.a include Applicant\u2019s unusual behavior in \nfailing to cooperate with the police when questioned about an alleged altercation with a \nride-share driver. In his testimony about the incident, Applicant made a reference to police \nviolence in the United States when arresting minorities as a justification for his refusal to \ncooperate and his resisting arrest. At the hearing, Applicant\u2019s counsel argued that \nApplicant\u2019s behavior was motivated by fear for his safety. (Tr. at 53, 64.) For that reason, \nI overrule the Government\u2019s objection and admit the Publications as evidence in this case. \nI will give these exhibits the weight that they deserve in the context of all of the other \nevidence presented. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 33 years old. He has never married, but he is presently engaged. He \nhas no children. He attended a U.S. military academy (the Academy) from June 2009 to \nNovember 2011. He played football at the Academy. He was dismissed from the \nAcademy before he had earned a degree. In April 2017, he completed his undergraduate \ncourses and received a bachelor\u2019s degree at another university. He also earned a \nmaster\u2019s degree in October 2020. He has worked as an engineer since 2017, most \nrecently as a systems engineer for a U.S. Government contractor. He seeks national \nsecurity eligibility in connection with his employment. He was denied eligibility by another \ngovernment agency in March 2021, one month before he submitted the e-QIP. (Tr. at 12-\n13, 40; GE 1 at 7, 14-20, 30, 62-64; GE 6 at 4.)   \nParagraph 1 (Guideline J, Criminal Conduct) \nIn the Answer, Applicant admitted \u201cwith clarifications\u201d each of the five allegations \nunder this guideline. The record evidence supports the following findings with respect to \nthe matters alleged in paragraph 1 of the SOR: \n1.a. March 2019 Arrest for Attempted Assault, Resisting Arrest, Obstruction of a \nPolice Officer, and Assault or Battery. Applicant engaged in a dispute with a driver from \na ride-share company (the Driver) after a night in a bar with friends. Applicant and his \nfriends were arguing with each other over where the Driver should go first. The Driver \npulled over and asked the occupants to get out of his car. Applicant got out of the car and \nproceeded to punch the Driver in his left cheek with a closed fist through the open window. \nApplicant and his friends entered a nearby hotel. The Driver called the police, and upon \narrival at the scene, the police interviewed the Driver. He provided the police with a \ndescription of Applicant\u2019s assault and advised that Applicant and his friends had entered \na hotel across the street. At the DOHA hearing, Applicant denied that he punched the \nDriver in the face. He also claimed it was the Driver who was being aggressive, and it \nwas Applicant who demanded the Driver to pull over and let the group leave the car so \nthey could find another ride to their homes.

The police attempted to question Applicant about the dispute. Applicant declined to \nrespond, even refusing to provide his name and identification card. He testified at the \nDOHA hearing that he was unaware that he was required to provide his name and \nidentification to the police. The police asked Applicant to provide his side of the story \nregarding his interactions with the Driver. He refused to speak and told his friends to \u201cshut \nup.\u201d The police further advised Applicant that he would not be allowed to leave without \nproperly identifying himself. He again refused. At the hearing, Applicant justified his lack \nof cooperation with the police by testifying \u201cthere was a lot of racial things going on in the \nnation, and I didn\u2019t want to be involved or be one of them.\u201d He also claimed he was \nunaware of the reason why the police were asking him questions. He was placed under \narrest for assaulting the Driver. He continued to refuse police orders and actively refused \nto put his hands behind his back so that he could be handcuffed. He was so strong that \nthe police could not undo his grip on his hands in front of him. He continued to resist all \ninstructions from the police, even after being told he would be pepper sprayed in the face \nif he did not cooperate. He was then pepper sprayed and handcuffed with his hands \nbehind his back. He refused to walk to the police vehicle, and due to his large size, four \npolice officers had to carry him to the vehicle. He further resisted the officers attempt to \nhave him sit in the vehicle. Instead, he laid on the back seat with his feet hanging outside \nthe door preventing it from closing. (Tr. at 14-17, 51-55; GE 2 at 8-9; GE 3 at 10-11; GE \n4 at 1; GE 5 at 1-10.) \nThe police determined that based upon the Driver\u2019s statement regarding the \nincident that they had probable cause to arrest Applicant for assault. They also concluded \nthat they had probable cause to arrest him for resisting arrest/obstructing a police officer. \nHe was charged with those two misdemeanor offenses. Applicant\u2019s version of the incident \nwith the Driver was unpersuasive, and his demeanor throughout his testimony regarding \nhis interaction with the police further undercut the credibility of his testimony. Moreover, \nApplicant\u2019s behavior was totally at odds with his stated concern about the police \noverreacting and using excessive force against him. In reality, his behavior reflected his \nabuse of alcohol that evening, which would explain why the criminal trial judge ordered \nApplicant to abstain from consuming alcohol for 90 days as part of his agreement to \ndismiss the charges. (Tr. at 14-17, 51-55; GE 2 at 8-9; GE 3 at 10-11; GE 4 at 1; GE 5 at \n1-10.) \n1.b. January 2013 Arrest for Abusive Sexual Conduct in Violation of the Uniform \nCode of Military Justice (UCMJ) Article 120. On or about May 14, 2011, Applicant, others \nfrom the Academy, and a female civilian (the Civilian) were together drinking alcohol at a \nnight club. The group then went to a hotel room to continue drinking alcohol. The Civilian \nwas intoxicated and laid down on a bed in the room. She then fell asleep. When Applicant \nand the Civilian were later alone in the room, Applicant laid down on the bed next to The \nCivilian and touch her genitals through her underwear. The Civilian awoke and told him \nto stop several times, which he did briefly. He continued to arouse himself against her \nbody and eventually ejaculated.

She subsequently identified Applicant when she saw his picture \non a television show in connection with other sexual assaults. The local police ceded \nprimary jurisdiction over the investigation and charges to the Academy. Applicant was \ncharged with violating Article 120 of the UCMJ. At the June 2012 courts-martial described \nin SOR \u00b6 1.c, Applicant was found not guilty of this charge. (Tr. at 17, 46-48; GE 6 at 2, \n4; GE 10 at 1-2.) \n1.c. June 2012 Court-Martial Trial and Conviction for Violations of UCMJ Articles \n80, 120, and 128. In June 2012, Applicant was court-martialed for the conduct set forth in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d and 1.e. He was charged with violating Articles 80, 120, and 128 of the \nUCMJ, and he was convicted on the specifications relating to the incidents alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e. Applicant was sentenced to dismissal from the service, six months of \nconfinement, and forfeiture of all pay and allowances. A punitive dismissal is the legal \nterm for the dishonorable discharge of an officer or academy cadet. He appealed and his \nconviction was upheld by the Court of Criminal Appeals for his branch of the military. He \nwas dismissed from the Academy. (Tr. at 21-22, 44; GE 6 at 1-2; GE 7; GE 8; GE 12.) \n1.d. December 2011 Arrest for Wrongful Sexual Contact in violation of UCMJ \nArticle 120. In November 2011, Applicant was investigated for a sexual assault involving \na female classmate (the Classmate) that occurred in about March 2011 in Applicant\u2019s \ndorm room at the Academy. He, two male classmates, and the Classmate spent several \nhours drinking alcohol and playing cards late at night. He met the Classmate for the first \ntime that evening. The Classmate became intoxicated and vomited. She fell asleep on \nthe bed of Applicant\u2019s roommate. The male classmates left the room to return to their \nrooms, leaving Applicant alone with the Classmate, who was asleep. Applicant was highly \nintoxicated. Applicant pulled his pants and underwear down to midthigh. The Classmate \nfelt Applicant entering the bed in which she was sleeping and lie behind her, pressing his \nbody against hers. He then took her hand and rubbed it against his genitals. After a few \nseconds, she was coherent enough to realize what Applicant was doing and pulled her \nhand away. She then vomited again. He claimed at the DOHA hearing that he stopped \nhis sexual actions when she told him to stop. Applicant testified at the DOHA hearing that \nhe was wrong to make the Classmate feel \u201cuncomfortable.\u201d Applicant was charged and \nconvicted of Wrongful Sexual Conduct in violation of Article 120 of the UCMJ. His \nconviction was upheld on appeal. Applicant did not acknowledge that his conduct was \ncriminal. (Tr. at 22-24, 45-46, 50-51; GE 7 at 3; GE 9 at 2, 8.) \n1.e. November 2011 Arrest for Assault by Battery and Attempted Sexual Contact \nin violation of Articles 128 and 120, respectively, of the UCMJ. After a night of drinking \nalcohol at a bar in November 2011, Applicant returned to the Academy campus with \nfriends from the Academy, including a former classmate (FC) who had passed out in the \nbathroom of the bar. FC had no memory of what happened after she passed out. \nApplicant and his friends carried FC to a dormitory room. The classmates left Applicant \nand FC alone in the room, and he locked the door.

The classmates \nfound FC unresponsive with her jeans unbuttoned unzipped and her shirt pulled up to \nchest level. An ambulance was called, and FC was taken to a hospital. In the investigation \nof the incident, Applicant denied that he touched FC, but claimed he was too intoxicated \nto be certain. He admitted that he kissed her earlier in the evening while she was \nincoherent. His overall version of the events that evening developed in the investigation \nsignificantly differed in critical details from the appellate court\u2019s recitation of the facts \ndeveloped at the court-martial. At one point, Applicant provided a statement in which he \nacknowledged getting into bed with FC, who was passed out. He commented that \u201cI \nstrongly believe its possible\u201d that he unbuttoned FC\u2019s jeans, \u201cbut I am not 100% sure \nbecause I cannot recall those events.\u201d At the DOHA hearing, Applicant denied he kissed \nFC and he otherwise did not recall what he did with FC that evening. Applicant was \ncharged and convicted of punching both classmates and choking one of them. Applicant \nwas also charged with and convicted of unwanted sexual conduct with FC, including \nkissing her when she was incoherent. His convictions under UCMJ Articles 80 and 128 \nwere upheld on appeal. See SOR \u00b6 1.c, infra.

The SOR cross alleges SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.e under Guideline D in this \nsubparagraph. \n2.b. Current registration as a Sex Offender in State 1. Applicant was required to \nregister as a Sex Offender as a result of his court-martial convictions. He registered in \nState 1 on June 22, 2012, and his registration requirement expires on June 22, 2027. He \nclaimed at the hearing that, due to a change in the laws of State 1, he was eligible to have \nhis name removed from the registration list at that time. (Tr. at 25, 57; GE 3 at 7.) \nParagraph 3 (Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption) \nIn the Answer, Applicant admitted with clarifications the two allegations under this \nguideline. The record evidence supports the following findings with respect to the matters \nalleged in paragraph 3 of the SOR: \n3.a. Alcohol Consumption during the period October 2011 to at least March 2019. \nAll of Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct alleged in paragraph 1 of the SOR was preceded by \nhis significant use of alcohol resulting in his intoxication.

April 2019 Alcohol Counseling. Applicant testified that he was ordered, by the \ncourt in the criminal case arising from his March 2019 arrest, to abstain from drinking \nalcohol for 90 days. He stated that he complied with this court order. Applicant claimed \nthat his participation in the counseling class was voluntary and that he completed the \ncounseling. In a letter addressed to Applicant\u2019s criminal defense attorney, dated April 29, \n2019, the alcohol counselor wrote that Applicant \u201cappeared to accept responsibility for his \nbehavior [on the day of his March 2019 arrest.]\u201d The counselor noted that Applicant had \ndecided to abstain from any further use of alcohol effective the night of his arrest. \nApplicant attended four individual counseling sessions. This letter was submitted to the \ncourt. At the DOHA hearing, Applicant testified that he no longer drinks alcohol to the \nextent he used to drink before his 2019 arrest. He refined his comment about his drinking \nhabits to say that he only consumes alcohol on rare occasions, such as at a wedding. \n(Answer at 6; Tr. at 26-27, 33-34, 56; AE A.) \nParagraph 4 (Guideline E, Personal Conduct) \nIn the Answer, Applicant admitted with clarifications the single allegation under this \nguideline. The SOR cross alleges SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.e under Guideline E in this \nparagraph. \nMitigation and Whole-Person Evidence \nApplicant provided extensive evidence in mitigation and in support of a favorable \nwhole-person assessment. I have carefully reviewed all of the evidence and note the \nfollowing specific items: \nApplicant provided a written statement of his intent to modify his drinking habits \nand attend counseling. He also wrote that he understood that any inappropriate future \ninvolvement with alcohol may be grounds for the revocation of his national security \neligibility, if granted to him. Applicant provided no evidence of any alcohol counseling or \ntreatment subsequent to the four sessions in March and April 2019. \nIn addition, Applicant provided six character-reference letters. A former classmate \nat the Academy wrote a letter prior to Applicant\u2019s 2019 arrest praising Applicant\u2019s \n\u201cdetermination and perseverance to reach his goal of becoming an engineer.\u201d He also \nwrote that he has been impressed by Applicant\u2019s \u201cunwavering devotion to overcoming his \npast.\u201d In an undated letter, Applicant\u2019s former girlfriend praised his character and \u201cability \nto be respectful.\u201d She commented that Applicant \u201cdid not allow his past to determine who \nhe is, and it is not an accurate reflection of what he will be in life.\u201d A friend of ten years \nwrote that Applicant is passionate and determined to reach his goals. Applicant\u2019s fianc\u00e9e \nwrote two letters that were submitted into the record. In her most recent letter, she \ncommented that the couple recently purchased a home. She wrote that Applicant was \ncompletely transparent before they began their dating relationship about his past \nproblems that are the subject of the SOR allegations.

This friend also \ncommented on Applicant\u2019s perseverance. (AE F at 3-5; AE S; AE BB at 1-3.) \nApplicant also submitted a lengthy letter from a licensed clinical social worker (the \nLCSW), who described the incidents leading up to Applicant\u2019s court-martial and provided \nher analysis of Applicant\u2019s qualifications under the adjudicative guidelines for Alcohol \nConsumption and Sexual Behavior. Her recitation of the facts was sometimes at odds \nwith the facts set forth in the official records submitted by the Government. Her version of \nthe facts was generally quite favorable to Applicant, minimizing the seriousness of his \nactions. Applicant specifically denied to the LCSW that he had ever \u201cengaged in any \nsexual assault.\u201d Also, he only reported to the LCSW one incident at the Academy and \nadvised her that he had \u201cblacked out\u201d after excessive alcohol consumption and did not \nrecall the details of the incident, which occurred in November 2011 and is the basis for \nthe allegations in SOR \u00b6 1.e. The LCSW wrote in her letter that despite his court-martial \nconviction and the adverse decision on appeal, Applicant still maintains that he is innocent \nof all of the charges. She wrote that the accusations against him were \u201cunfounded.\u201d She \nexplained in another part of her letter that Applicant believes he was set up by a classmate \nwho was acting as a confidential informant. The LCSW concluded that despite Applicant\u2019s \nhistory, he has \u201cno probability of sexual addiction\u201d or \u201calcohol use disorder.\u201d He also \ndenied to the LCSW that he assaulted the Driver in 2019. (AE P at 3-8.) \nThe LCSW also reported that according to Applicant he has never engaged in any \nhabitual or binge consumption of alcohol. He advised the LCSW that, as of the date of his \nNovember 2021 interview with her, he drinks alcohol two to four times a month and drinks \nthree to four drinks when he does consume alcohol. (AE P at 5, 8.) \nApplicant also submitted evidence of his community involvement, specifically with \nan orphanage founded by his parents in the country of his birth. He is a member of the \nBoard and assists with fundraising, among other activities. (AE H, AE Y, AE Z.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 - Guideline J - Criminal Conduct \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for criminal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 30, which states: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes the following three conditions that could raise security concerns \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n(e) discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces for reasons less than \n\u201cHonorable.\u201d \nThe record evidence established all three disqualifying conditions. With respect to \nthe allegations under SOR \u00b6 1.b, the evidence of the sexual assault discussed above \nsatisfies the substantial evidence standard applicable in this case, even though Applicant \nwas found not guilty of these specifications at the court-martial under the more stringent \nevidentiary standard applicable in a criminal case under the UCMJ. The offense was \nreported to the law enforcement authorities the next day and the victim, the Civilian, went \nto the hospital where physical evidence was collected against him. This evidence and the \nevidence presented that addressed SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c through 1.e, which includes his \ncourt-martial conviction and resulting dismissal from the Armed Forces, shift the burden \nto Applicant to mitigate the security concerns raised under this guideline. \nThe guideline includes the following two conditions in AG \u00b6 32 that could mitigate \nthe security concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and  \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement.  \nApplicant has not provided sufficient evidence to establish either of the above \nmitigating conditions. Applicant has a history of criminal conduct that began in 2011 and \nmost recently occurred in 2019. In light of that pattern of criminal behavior, insufficient \ntime has passed to permit a conclusion that similar behavior is unlikely to recur. Moreover, \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nthat pattern of behavior still creates serious doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. \nApplicant has produced some evidence of rehabilitation. He has earned two \ndegrees and has been employed by U.S. Government contractors. He has also provided \nevidence of constructive community involvement. More importantly, however, he has not \nshown any significant contrition, either to the females he wrongfully assaulted under \ncircumstances where he knew the women were so intoxicated and/or unconscious that \nthey had no reasonable opportunity to participate willingly or to object. He also has denied \npunching the Driver, and he has expressed no regret for failing to comply with the \nlegitimate instructions from the police officers, especially after he was placed under arrest. \nApplicant\u2019s active resistance directly conflicts with his purported concerns about \nexcessive force by law enforcement. Rather, Applicant\u2019s conduct reflects questionable \njudgment and casts doubt on his ability to comply with laws and rules. The absence of \nany credible evidence of contrition on Applicant\u2019s part for his criminal conduct \nsubstantially undercuts his evidence of rehabilitation under this mitigating condition. \nParagraph 1 is found against Applicant.  \nParagraph 2 \u2013 Guideline D, Sexual Behavior \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for sexual behavior are set out in \nAG \u00b6 12, which states: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Sexual behavior \nincludes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, electronic, or \nwritten transmission. No adverse inference concerning the standards in this \nGuideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual orientation of the \nindividual. \nAG \u00b6 13 describes the following three conditions that could raise security concerns \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and  \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe record evidence supports the application of all of the above conditions. \nApplicant repeatedly engaged in criminal sexual behavior. His history, and ongoing denial \nof culpability, make him vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress. His sexual \nbehavior with a very intoxicated woman in his dorm room was of a public nature since his \nclassmates descended on him once they determined what he had done behind a locked \ndoor. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s conduct reflects a serious lack of judgment, even though \nsome of it might not be considered to have been \u201cof a public nature.\u201d \nThe guideline includes the following two conditions in AG \u00b6 14 that could mitigate \nthe security concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; and \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress. \nApplicant refuses to accept responsibility for his actions. He denied to the LCSW \nthat he ever committed any sexual assaults, notwithstanding his court-martial conviction, \nwhich was upheld on appeal. His evidence in mitigation is insufficient to permit a \nconclusion that his past behavior is unlikely to recur. His past actions combined with his \nongoing denials cast doubt of his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nMitigation under AG \u00b6 14(b) has not been established. \nState 1 requires that Applicant register as a sex offender so that the public is aware \nof the potential danger he represents. His registration, however, somewhat reduces the \npotential for coercion, exploitation, or duress. Accordingly, AG \u00b6 14(c) has some \napplication. Overall, however, Applicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to establish mitigation \nof security concerns created by the pattern of criminal sexual behavior developed by the \nrecord evidence. \nParagraph 3 - Guideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for alcohol consumption are set out \nin AG \u00b6 21, which states: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 22 describes the following two conditions that could raise security concerns \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nand \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nThe record evidence supports the application of these conditions. Applicant has \nexperienced numerous incidents in which his excessive alcohol consumption and binge \ndrinking contributed to his criminal conduct and impaired judgment. This evidence shifts \nthe burden to Applicant to mitigate the security concerns raised under this guideline. \nThe guideline includes the following four conditions in AG \u00b6 23 that could mitigate \nthe security concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n. \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \nApplicant\u2019s problematic alcohol consumption was frequent and happened under \nsuch circumstances that it might recur. As commented below, it is apparent that he is not \njust drinking alcohol on rare occasions as he asserts. Also, his alcohol consumption casts \ncontinuing doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 \n23(a) was not established. \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant and his fianc\u00e9e assert that he no longer abuses alcohol. However, there \nis limited evidence in the record demonstrating a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption. At the hearing, Applicant testified that currently he rarely drinks alcohol \u2013 \nfor example, when he attends a wedding or special occasion. In a more credible \nstatement, Applicant advised the LCSW in 2021 that he typically drank three to four \nglasses of alcohol two to four times a month. Moreover, there is no evidence that he has \nmodified his consumption of alcohol in accordance with treatment recommendations. \nApplicant\u2019s four classes of alcohol counseling in April 2019 are insufficient to qualify as \nalcohol treatment. The record contains no evidence that Applicant has ever had any \nongoing treatment to help him prevent future abuse of alcohol. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 \n23(b) has not been established. \nThere is no evidence that Applicant has ever participated in alcohol treatment other \nthan four counseling sessions in March-April 2019. AG \u00b6 23(c) and 23(d) are not \napplicable. Overall, Applicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to establish mitigation under this \nguideline. Paragraph 3 is found against Applicant. \nParagraph 4 \u2013 Guideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which states: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nAG \u00b6 16 sets forth the following condition that could raise security concerns and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \nSOR \u00b6 4.a is merely an additional cross-allegation under Guideline E of conduct \nalready alleged under Guideline J. AG \u00b6 16(c) is not established, as it requires \u201ccredible \nadverse information in several adjudicative areas that is not sufficient for an adverse \ndetermination under any other single guideline. . . .\u201d The personal conduct general \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconcern (AG \u00b6 15) and the whole-person analysis below are established, given that \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct evidences his questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nand unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. However, since the conduct is \nfully addressed under other guidelines, as discussed above, I consider the personal \nconduct cross-allegation to be duplicative, and I find SOR \u00b6 4(a) for Applicant solely on \nthat basis. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of facts established under the guidelines alleged in the SOR and \nthe whole-person concept. \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines J, D, G, and E in my whole-person analysis. Further comments are \nwarranted. The overall impression that Applicant established is that he is young man with \na difficult past to explain. Instead of sincerely owning what he has done and establishing \nthe ways that he has matured or otherwise changed, he has minimized his past \nmisconduct, first with the LCSW and then at the hearing. For instance, he regrets that he \nmade a woman feel \u201cuncomfortable\u201d with his sexual advances without admitting that he \nsexually assaulted her and committed a crime in doing so. Similarly, he deflects \nresponsibility by arguing that he was too intoxicated to recall the events of a second \nsexual assault. He expressed no regret for his excessive drinking that night. The events \nsurrounding Applicant\u2019s 2019 arrest show that his pattern of problematic alcohol \nconsumption, questionable judgment, and criminal behavior has persisted in his post-\nAcademy civilian life. Applicant has not provided credible evidence to show he has \nachieved the necessary maturity or experienced sufficient personal growth to correct his \npast behavior, particularly under the influence of alcohol.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the allegations in the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e and denied 2.a through 2.e and 3.a. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 44 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2004. He never married. He has a seven-year-old daughter from a relationship. He has worked for his current employer, a federal contractor, since 2015. (Tr. 22-25) In May 2000, Applicant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI). It occurred in a state where Applicant did not live. In September 2007, he completed a security clearance (SCA) application. Question 23 asked about Applicant\u2019s police record. It specifically asked if he had ever been charged or convicted of any offenses related to alcohol or drugs. He responded \u201cno.\u201d In response to the \u201cother offense\u201d category it requested to provide a \u201cdate of offense.\u201d He wrote \u201c5/2000.\u201d Under the question on the form, he was asked to check if the offense involved a felony, firearms or explosives, pending criminal, alcohol or drugs, court martial or other disciplinary proceeding, and any offense not listed in the above categories.

Applicant requested a continuance, \nwhich was granted. I convened the hearing as rescheduled on August 30, 2023. The \nGovernment offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 12. Applicant and two witnesses testified. \nHe offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through J. There were no objections to any of the \nexhibits offered and all were admitted in evidence. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript on September 12, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the allegations in the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e and denied 2.a \nthrough 2.e and 3.a. Applicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \nApplicant is 44 years old. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2004. He never \nmarried. He has a seven-year-old daughter from a relationship. He has worked for his \ncurrent employer, a federal contractor, since 2015. (Tr. 22-25) \nIn May 2000, Applicant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol \n(DUI). It occurred in a state where Applicant did not live. In September 2007, he \ncompleted a security clearance (SCA) application. Question 23 asked about Applicant\u2019s \npolice record. It specifically asked if he had ever been charged or convicted of any \noffenses related to alcohol or drugs. He responded \u201cno.\u201d In response to the \u201cother \noffense\u201d category it requested to provide a \u201cdate of offense.\u201d He wrote \u201c5/2000.\u201d Under \nthe question on the form, he was asked to check if the offense involved a felony, \nfirearms or explosives, pending criminal, alcohol or drugs, court martial or other \ndisciplinary proceeding, and any offense not listed in the above categories. Applicant \nchecked the last box as an offense not listed in the above categories. He did not check \nthe alcohol or drugs category box. He provided information about the offense and \nstated: \nIn the year 2000, when I was 21 years of age I was in a situation where I \nreceived a wreckless [sic] driving charge. That matter was closed out in \n2005 and I have not received anything more then a speeding ticket before \nor after the situation. (GE 2) \nUnder the section \u201caction taken\u201d he wrote: \nI went to court and paid a fine for the wreckless (sic) driving[.] I didn\u2019t lose \nmy license or anything, and have not done anything larger or smaller then \na speeding ticket before or after that. That as my only run with the [l]aw \nsince I was born.

Got on a[n] airplane the \nnext week and flew to [X] and took care of the matter in one day. And that \nwas the end of the situation. (GE 2) \nApplicant testified that the reason he checked \u201cno\u201d regarding an offense related \nto alcohol, and the reason he failed to disclose his arrest and charge for DUI was \nbecause he did not understand the question. He said he believed the charge was \nreduced to \u201cwet and reckless\u201d and he paid a fine. In the state where Applicant was \narrested the term \u201cwet reckless\u201d refers to a DUI charge that was reduced based on a \nplea agreement and the offense involved alcohol.1 Applicant stated that he was \nconfused how to report his DUI offense. He did not think he had to report it because he \nwas not convicted. He said even though he marked \u201cno\u201d on his 2007 SCA regarding an \nalcohol offense that he wrote a letter to the federal government before he submitted his \nclearance application, and he made the government aware of his charge. He did not \nprovide a copy of the letter or other corroborating evidence. He said that part of the \ncontents of the letter are included in his comments that are noted above and were \nincluded in the SCA. He testified that he was not trying to mislead the government. \nAlthough the charge of DUI may have been reduced, the \u201cwet and reckless\u201d charge \ninvolved alcohol, which the SCA specifically asked, and he did not disclose. (Tr. 22-35, \n53-64) \nIn 2013, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. He did not report his \narrest to his facility security officer (FSO) or employer. He said he was unaware that he \nwas required to report the arrest because he held a clearance and thought he only had \nto report a conviction. When arrested he refused to take a breathalyzer because his \nattorney had previously advised him not to because the machine is inaccurate. This \ncase was eventually nolle prosed. He was unsure why the charge was not prosecuted. \nHe admitted he had consumed alcohol before the arrest. He failed the field sobriety test, \nand he told the police officer that he had consumed two beers and two shots of alcohol \nforty-five minutes before his arrest. During his May 2019 background interview, he \ndenied he consumed any alcohol. At his hearing, he said he likely had more than one \ndrink hours before his arrest. (Tr. 35-38, 49, 74-80; GE 3, 9; AE B, C) \nIn 2017, Applicant completed another SCA. Section 22 asked if in the last seven \nyears he had been arrested by a police officer, sheriff, marshal of any other law \nenforcement official. He responded \u201cno.\u201d It also asked if he had EVER been charged \nwith an offense involving alcohol or drugs. He responded \u201cno.\u201d He did not disclose his \nMay 2000 DUI arrest or later reduced \u201cwet and reckless\u201d charge or his September 2013 \nDUI arrest and charge. He again testified that these were not reported as required \nbecause they had been dismissed and there was nothing to report, and he thought they \nwent away.

He told the investigator that he did not report his prior \narrests on his 2017 SCA due to an oversight and because all of this information had \nbeen previously provided over the years and was provided during his initial security \ninvestigation and 10-year renewal process. He reiterated this explanation in his \ninterrogatories. He admitted he had been drinking when he was arrested in 2000. \nApplicant testified that when he was specifically asked about his previous arrests, he \ndisclosed them to the investigator. He did not otherwise because he thought he only \nhad to disclose convictions. I did not find Applicant\u2019s testimony credible. (Tr. 68-73; GE \n3) \nIn February 2019, Applicant was arrested for DUI. He said he did not think he \nhad to report it to his employer if it was dismissed. He testified that he reported this DUI \nto his employer after it was dismissed. He said that at this point he learned that he was \nrequired to report his arrests. He said he thought if the case went away, he would not \nhave to report it. (Tr. 80-86; GE 3, 4, 8) \nThe police report for his February 2019 arrest reflects Applicant\u2019s car was parked \nhalf on the pavement and half on a grassy area with its hazard lights on. Applicant was \nslumped in the seat and the car was running. The police officer could not conduct a field \nsobriety test because Applicant was too intoxicated. He testified he does not know what \nhe was doing at the time. He refused to take a breathalyzer. During a December 2021 \ninterview with a government investigator, Applicant said he entered a pretrial diversion \n(PTD) program and over a seven-to-eight-month period, he was required to be tested \nfor alcohol consumption. He was also required to attend an alcohol awareness class \nthrough Alcoholics Anonymous (AA). Applicant testified that after going through the PTD \nprogram, this was the first time he thought he might have an alcohol problem. Applicant \ncontinued to consume alcohol. (Tr. 80-87; GE 4, 8) \nIn May 2019, Applicant was interviewed again by a government investigator and \nasked he if had ever been arrested or charged with an alcohol-related offense. The \ninvestigator indicated Applicant responded \u201cno.\u201d Applicant disputes that and said he told \nthe investigator he had been charged but not convicted. In this interview they discussed \nhis 2013 DUI arrest. He denied he had been drinking. This contradicts the police report \nand his testimony. He disclosed to the investigator he had also been arrested in \nFebruary 2019 and charged with DUI. At the time of the interview, the charges had not \nbeen adjudicated. He admitted to the investigator that he had been consuming alcohol \nprior to his arrest. He said this type of incident was unlikely to recur because he does \nnot drink and drive. (Tr. 88-90; GE 3) \nApplicant did not disclose his May 2000 or September 2013 arrests and charges \nfor DUI or \u201cwet reckless\u201d or any alcohol related offenses in his 2007 or 2017 SCA.

Question 2 \nasked: Have you consumed any alcohol since January 2019. He responded \u201cno.\u201d At his \nhearing, he testified that he did consume alcohol after that date. As noted, he was \narrested in February 2019 and charged with DUI. (Tr. 87-90; GE 4) \nIn response to the June 2019 interrogatories, Applicant wrote: \nI do not consider myself as a heavy drinker or an irresponsible drink[er]. I \nam not an alcoholic, nor do I drink on a[n] everyday or every month basics \n[sic]. I have never been convicted of DUI or for having a drinking issue. \n(GE 4) \nIn June 2020, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. He was found \npassed out at the wheel of his car while sitting at a traffic light. He took a breathalyzer \ntest at the scene and recorded a .24% BAC. The police offered to take him to the \nhospital because he was so intoxicated. Applicant testified he was not feeling well and \nhad taken some cold medicine. Once at the police station, he refused to take another \nbreathalyzer. Applicant was convicted of DUI. He was ordered to pay a fine and \nsentenced to 365 days in jail, suspended; and attend a highway intoxication seminar. \nApplicant admitted he was driving while intoxicated. According to the employer\u2019s \ndocuments, in October 2020, Applicant informed them he was arrested on August 21, \n2020, for DUI. Applicant testified that his June 2000 conviction was appealed and was \nsent to the circuit court where he was approved to participate in a PTD program. (Tr. 90-\n106; GE 5, 7, 11; AE E) \nIn January 2021, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI. It is unclear if he \nwas still participating in a PTD program from his June 2020 DUI charge. He told the \npolice he had consumed two beers. He failed a field sobriety test and recorded a .11% \nBAC. Applicant disputed the accuracy of the BAC saying it took numerous attempts to \ncomplete it. The police officer noted that Applicant had trouble following simple \ninstructions. Applicant does not believe he was intoxicated or impaired. He admitted he \nhad a few beers. His case was adjudicated in a PTD program. He continued to drink \nafter his January 2021 arrest. He testified that he last consumed alcohol in July 2021. \nHe said he realized he needed to stop drinking alcohol. (Tr. 106-118; GE 3, 6, 12; AE E, \nG, I) \nThe requirements of this PTD program were to complete a 12-week 36 session \nalcohol rehabilitation class, be tested for alcohol consumption, and perform community \nservice. Applicant went to court ordered AA but did not resume when the PTD program \nended. He successfully completed the alcohol rehabilitation class and found it very \nhelpful.

(Tr. 112-127; AE E) \nIn Applicant\u2019s government interrogatories from June 2022, he made a correction \nto his summary of interview from November 2018. He stated he told the investigator that \nhe had been charged with an offense involving alcohol, but he was not convicted. He \nstated: \nThe reason there was an oversight in the information is due to the fact that \nall of this information has been provided over the years as it relates to my \nsecurity clearance and wasn\u2019t hidden in any way, due to the fact that the \ncase was 22 years ago, but again, never hidden and provided during my \ninitial security clearance investigation and 10 year renewal process. (GE \n3) \nApplicant testified that he did not report the first four DUI arrests to his employer until \n2020 when he became aware of the requirement to do so because he held a security \nclearance. He reported his 2021 DUI. He explained he did not report the pre-2020 \ncharges because he believed if the charge was dismissed the case was resolved, and \nhe was not required to report it. (Tr. 53-58) \nApplicant testified that he was a social drinker. He would not drink at home alone. \nHe did not realize for a period that he might have an alcohol problem. His mistake was \ndrinking and driving. He stated the alcohol class he was required to take as part of his \nlast PTD was very helpful. He took responsibility for his conduct. He believes he is not a \nthreat to national security and can be trusted. (Tr. 40-46) \nApplicant admitted he is an alcoholic. He testified that he no longer consumes \nalcohol. He does not have the urge to drink. He does not go to clubs. He used to drink \non the weekends and admitted he would occasionally drive after consuming alcohol. His \ncousin is a recovering alcoholic and acted as his sponsor while he was attending the \ncourt-ordered classes. He still has regular contact with his cousin. (Tr. 127-132) \nThe chief executive officer (CEO) of the rehabilitation center that Applicant \nattended testified on his behalf. He described him as an excellent participant who \nhelped others and followed all of the rules. He never missed a session. He believes \nApplicant is in recovery. After Applicant completed the course, he would return \nperiodically. The CEO explained that anyone in recovery can relapse, but Applicant has \nbeen sober for about two years. (Tr. 136-139; AE A) \nA substance abuse counselor employed where Applicant attended rehabilitation \ntestified that participants are welcomed to return after they graduate.

(AE J) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility: \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a nation \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group.

He responded \u201cno.\u201d I did not find \nApplicant\u2019s explanations credible throughout his hearing and find he deliberately failed \nto disclose he was arrested for DUI and although the charge was reduced to \u201cwet and \nreckless\u201d this was still an alcohol-related offense required to be disclosed on his SCA. \nApplicant\u2019s November 2017 SCA asked if in the last seven years he had received \na notice to appear in a court proceeding; if he had been arrested by any police officer or \nlaw enforcement official; and if he had been charged, convicted, or sentenced for a \ncrime in any court. He responded \u201cno.\u201d Applicant was arrested for DUI in 2013. I did not \nfind his explanations credible and find he deliberately failed to disclose this alcohol-\nrelated offense. \nApplicant\u2019s November 2017 SCA asked him about other offenses that were not \npreviously disclosed and if he had ever been charged with an offense involving alcohol \nor drugs. He responded \u201cno\u201d and did not disclose his May 2000 DUI charge or his 2013 \nDUI charge. \nApplicant disputes that during his November 2018 interview with a government \ninvestigator that he failed to disclose his May 2000 and September 2013 DUI charges. I \nfind there is some question as to whether Applicant volunteered the information about \nthe May 2000 DUI arrest or if the disclosure only came after he was confronted with the \ninformation. I find the evidence is insufficient to conclude he provided false information \nabout the May 2000 DUI charged and conclude in his favor that part of the allegation in \nSOR \u00b6 2.e. \nRegarding disclosing to the government investigator information about his \nSeptember 2013 DUI charge, the evidence supports he did not disclose this information \nduring the November 2018 interview. This information was later disclosed during his \nMay 2019 interview. I did not find Applicant\u2019s explanations credible and believe he \ndeliberately failed to disclose his September 2013 DUI charge during his November \n2018 subject interview. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nI did not find Applicant credible that he believed he did not have to disclose his \narrests and charges because he was not convicted. He was originally charged with DUI \nin May 2000. That charge was reduced to \u201cwet and reckless\u201d which is an alcohol-related \noffense that should have been disclosed. Applicant makes no mention in his SCA that \nthis offense involved alcohol. He specifically checked the \u201cother\u201d box instead of the box \nindicating the offense involved alcohol. \nApplicant\u2019s five DUI arrests and charges were cross-alleged under the alcohol \nconsumption and criminal conduct guidelines. There is sufficient evidence to apply AG \n\u00b616(e) to his conduct. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those disqualifying \nconditions, the burden shifted to Applicant prove mitigation. The following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable to the disqualifying security \nconcerns based on the facts: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; and \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nThere is insufficient evidence that Applicant made prompt, good-faith efforts to \ncorrect his omissions or falsifications made when completing his SCA or statements \nmade to the government investigator. AG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s omissions and falsification are not minor. I did not find his explanation \nthat he believed he only had to disclose convictions on his SCA credible. He clearly was \nconvicted of the May 2000 criminal offense that was alcohol-related yet still did not \ndisclose it. His omissions and falsification are serious and cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply. \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern for alcohol consumption: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nAG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. I find the following to be potentially applicable: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nApplicant was arrested and charged with DUI in May 2020, September 2013, \nFebruary 2019, June 2020, and January 2021.

The above disqualifying \nconditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from alcohol consumption. I have considered the following mitigating conditions \nunder AG \u00b6 23: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \nAs noted above in the personal conduct guideline analysis, I have concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s candor and credibility. Applicant was involved in five alcohol-related \nincidents. After his 2021 DUI arrest and charge, he was ordered to attend AA and \nparticipate and complete a substance abuse and treatment program. He did so \nsuccessfully. Applicant testified that he has not consumed alcohol since July 2021. He \npreviously stated that he did not intend to be involved in any further alcohol-related \nincidents and had stated in interrogatories that he had not consumed alcohol after \nJanuary 2019 when he actually did and was arrested again in February 2019 for DUI. \nApplicant acknowledged he is an alcoholic. He testified he talks to his cousin who \nis also an alcoholic, and he is his sponsor. However, he has not attended AA since he \ncompleted the mandatory requirement by the court, and it is unknown if his cousin is \naffiliated with AA or another substance abuse program. The CEO of the rehabilitation \nand treatment center where Applicant attended stated that he occasionally stops by and \nis very helpful to others. A counselor who evaluated Applicant believes he is at low risk \nfor relapse. There is evidence that he acknowledges his pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse. Applicant has a 20-year history of alcohol issues. He recently acknowledged he \nhas an alcohol problem but there is limited corroboration as to him being involved in a \nstructured support system. In the past, he has not been honest about his alcohol use. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDespite some evidence of mitigation, I cannot find that sufficient time has passed to \nconclude future behavior is unlikely to recur. I find AG \u00b6 23(a) does not apply. \nThere is insufficient evidence that Applicant is currently participating in \ncounseling or treatment. Therefore, I find AG \u00b6 23(c) does not apply. Although, \nApplicant stated he has not consumed any alcohol since July 2021, based on his long \nhistory of alcohol use, numerous alcohol-related incidents, and credibility issues, \ndespite some evidence of mitigation, it is insufficient to fully mitigate the security \nconcerns raised. I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b) and 23(d) have minimal application. \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 31, and the following is \npotentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant was arrested and charged five times for DUI. The evidence supports \nthat he consumed alcohol before he was arrested. Some charges were reduced or \ndismissed, and others were adjudicated through PTD programs. The above \ndisqualifying conditions applies. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from criminal conduct. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 32 are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant has been charged five times with DUI from 2000 to 2021. Although, he \nwas not convicted, he was repeatedly arrested for driving after he had consumed \nalcohol. His conduct raises questions about his judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. The same analysis under Guideline G, alcohol consumption and \nGuideline E, personal conduct security concerns apply under this analysis. Although, \nthere is some evidence that Applicant may no longer be consuming alcohol, it is too \nsoon to conclude that future criminal conduct is unlikely to recur. I find the above \nmitigating conditions have some application, but they are insufficient to fully mitigate the \ncriminal conduct security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines G, E, and J in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden of persuasion. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me with serious questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concern arising under the personal conduct, alcohol consumption, and criminal \nconduct guidelines. \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a-2.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.e: \nAgainst Applicant (excepting \n \u201c1.a\u201d) \nParagraph 3, Guideline J:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCarol G.

He married in 2006, divorced in 2009, married for the second time in \n2015, and divorced in 2018. He lives with a cohabitant in what he describes as a \ncommon-law marriage. He has three children. (Transcript (Tr.) at 17-21, 60-61; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant served in the U.S. Army from August 2007 until he was honorably \ndischarged for medical reasons in August 2008. He testified that he served \u201c[a] little \nshort of two years.\u201d His DD-214 indicates that he served 11 months and 23 days. (Tr. at \n19; AE A) \nApplicant was still in a training command in March 2008 because of his medical \nissues. Two soldiers reported that Applicant attempted to sell them ecstasy (3, 4 \nmethylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)), an illegal controlled substance. One of the \nsoldiers stated that he overheard Applicant tell a soldier that he had two more to sell. \nApplicant then asked the soldier if he wanted some ecstasy. The soldier said, \u201chell no,\u201d \nand reported the incident to the sergeant first class on duty. (Tr. at 20, 41-42; GE 1, 7) \nThe duty sergeant confronted Applicant, read him his rights, and asked him to \nempty his pockets and his wallet. The sergeant found two pills inside a plastic wrapper \nin Applicant\u2019s wallet that were later determined to be MDMA. The sergeant asked \nApplicant what the pills were, and he answered ecstasy. A Criminal Investigation \nCommand (CID) investigation was initiated in 2008. Applicant waived his right to remain \nsilent and provided a sworn statement. (GE 7) \nIn the sworn statement to the CID, Applicant stated that there was a song on that \nwas about ecstasy, and he asked the soldiers if either had used ecstasy before, but he \ndenied selling or attempting to sell ecstasy. He stated that he obtained the two pills in \nJanuary 2008 while at a strip club. Someone at the club traded Applicant the two pills \nfor some beers. The individual said the pills were some kind of medication but did not \nsay what medication. Applicant stated that he assumed they were some kind of pain \npills. Applicant placed the pills in his wallet, where they were later discovered in March \n2008 by the duty sergeant. Applicant specifically stated that he only received two pills, \nand he never took any of the pills. He was given a urinalysis drug test that day, which \ntested positive for MDMA. (GE 7) \nThe CID referred the investigation to Applicant\u2019s command for the offenses of \nwrongful possession of hallucinogens with intent to distribute, wrongful use of \nhallucinogens, and false official statement.

I note that the CID reported that he was an E-2 in March 2008, and his DD-\n214 reported that he was an E-1 when he was discharged. (GE 7) \nApplicant was interviewed for his background investigation in August 2021. The \ninterview was summarized in a report of investigation (ROI). Applicant confirmed the \naccuracy of the ROI in August 2022. He admitted during the interview that several \nsoldiers reported that he was selling ecstasy to soldiers. He stated that people lied, that \nthe military was a hostile environment, and he was not liked. He stated that he never \ntried to sell drugs, and a drug was never obtained in the incident. (GE 2) \nApplicant provided a slightly different story during his testimony. He denied \nknowledge that the pills were ecstasy, and he denied trying to sell the pills to other \nsoldiers. He stated that he received three pills in the strip club, and he took one for a \nheadache, thinking it was pain medication. He stated that he forgot he had the pills in \nhis wallet. He did not recall if he was given a urinalysis drug test, and he did not recall \nbeing informed that he tested positive for ecstasy or MDMA. (Tr. at 41-46) \nI did not find Applicant credible. I find the CID report to be far more reliable. I find \nApplicant knowingly used ecstasy, had at least two ecstasy pills that he tried to sell, and \ntested positive for MDMA. I further find that he intentionally provided false information \nabout the incident to CID (false official statement), during his 2021 background \ninterview, and during his testimony. \nApplicant was driving with his two-year old child in a child seat in May 2019 when \nhe was stopped by the police for defective tail lamps. He voluntarily gave the police \nconsent to search his vehicle. The police discovered under the driver\u2019s side seat a \ncanister of white powder that was later identified through analysis to be about three \ngrams of methamphetamine. A small backpack was on the floor by the front \npassenger\u2019s seat. There was a canister with suspected methamphetamine residue in \nthe backpack. A glass pipe of the type that is commonly used to smoke drugs was also \nin the backpack. Small clear baggies were found in the driver\u2019s side door and in the \nbackpack. (Tr. at 32-41; GE 8) \nWhen he was arrested, the police discovered two small clear baggies with \nmethamphetamine residue in his right front pocket and a container with .1 gram of \nmethamphetamine in his left front pocket. A med-kit with multiple containers of \nsuspected THC oil was found under the passenger seat. Possession of marijuana or \nTHC was not a violation of state law. (GE 8) \nApplicant was charged with possession of a controlled substance for the \nmethamphetamine and possession of drug paraphernalia. In June 2019, a warrant was \nissued for his failure to appear at a court date, and he was arrested. He stated that he \nhad moved and did not receive notice of the court date. In October 2019, he pleaded \nguilty to possession of a controlled substance, and the other charges were dismissed. \nHe was sentenced to supervised probation for two years, completion of a substance \nabuse evaluation with the requirement to follow any recommendations, and community \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nservice.

(Tr. at 36, 46-49; GE \n6, 8-10; AE E) \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) in \nJune 2021. He reported the May 2019 arrest and subsequent conviction for possession \nof a controlled substance. He denied illegally using any illegal drugs or controlled \nsubstances in the last seven years. (GE 1) \nWhen he was interviewed for his background investigation in August 2021, \nApplicant stated that he was unaware there was methamphetamine in his car when he \nwas \narrested \nin \nMay \n2019. \nHe \ndenied \nknowingly \nusing \nor \npossessing \nmethamphetamine. He stated that he let someone else use his vehicle, and the person \nmust have left the drugs in his car without his knowledge. He stated that he did not \nknow the friend\u2019s name, and he no longer associated with him. He also told the \ninvestigator that the June 2019 arrests for failure to appear were for the same incident. \n(GE 2) \nApplicant testified that he was going through a difficult time in his marriage, and \nhe used methamphetamine on one occasion before his arrest. He admitted that he had \nbaggies in his pocket that were from when he used methamphetamine. He continued to \ndeny that he knew there was methamphetamine in his vehicle. He stated he lent the \nvehicle to the friend he used methamphetamine with, and that person must have left the \nmethamphetamine in the vehicle. He denied any additional drug involvement. He stated \nthat he took responsibility for his bad decision to use methamphetamine, and he \ndisassociated himself from anyone involved in illegal drugs. (Tr. at 32-40; AE E) \nApplicant denied being untruthful during his 2021 background interview. He \ntestified that he did not mention to the investigator that baggies were found in his pocket \nbecause he did not remember that fact. (Tr. at 40-41, 49-50, 59; GE 2) \nI did not find Applicant credible. I find he knowingly possessed and used \nmethamphetamine. I further find that he intentionally provided false information when he \nfailed to list his use of methamphetamine on his SF 86, during his 2021 background \ninterview when he stated that he was unaware there was methamphetamine in his car \nand he denied knowingly using or possessing methamphetamine, and during his \ntestimony. \nThe SOR alleges a $3,069 collection account to a bank (SOR \u00b6 1.a), a $483 \ncollection account to a telecommunications company (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and a balance of \n$16,364 due on an auto loan after the vehicle was repossessed (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Applicant \nadmitted owing the first two debts, but he stated that he paid the auto debt. The debts \nare listed on one or more credit reports. Applicant did not report any financial issues \nwhen he submitted his June 2021 SF 86, even though all the debts were delinquent by \nthen.

He stated that he tried to get the \nring back from her after they separated, but she told him that she lost the ring. He was \nunable to get her to pay the account, so he unsuccessfully disputed it with the credit \nreporting agencies. He stated that he then did not have the ability to pay the debt. In \nOctober 2023, he agreed to make partial payments of $100 a month for seven months, \nwith the first payment due on October 20, 2023. He testified that he made the first \npayment, but he did not provide any documentary evidence. (Tr. at 21-24; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 3-5; AE B) \nApplicant stated that the $483 collection account to a telecommunications \ncompany (SOR \u00b6 1.b) was for equipment that he returned, but the company did not \nhave records that it was returned. He stated that if he was given a receipt for the \nreturned equipment, he no longer has it. He unsuccessfully disputed the debt with the \ncredit reporting agencies. He has decided to pay the debt. (Tr. at 24-26; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 2-5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges an unpaid balance of $16,364 due on an auto loan after the \nvehicle was repossessed. Applicant testified that the vehicle developed transmission \nproblems, and he was told he needed a new transmission. He had an extended \nwarranty on the vehicle, but the holder of the warranty told him that he did not need a \nnew transmission. He stopped paying the loan, and the vehicle was repossessed. The \nvehicle was auctioned, and the creditor waived any deficiency, resulting in a $0 balance. \nDuring his background interview in July 2021, he stated that he bought a more \nexpensive vehicle than he could afford, he missed payments, and the vehicle was \nrepossessed. He never mentioned transmission problems. (Tr. at 26-30; Applicant\u2019s \nresponse to SOR; GE 2-5; AE C, D) \nApplicant stated that his finances are now in order. He stated that he intends to \npay the remaining SOR debts. (Tr. at 21-32, 58) \nApplicant submitted documents and letters attesting to his excellent job \nperformance and strong moral character. He is praised for his work ethic, expertise, \ntrustworthiness, professionalism, commitment to the mission, craftsmanship, dedication, \nleadership, reliability, and integrity.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nWhile in the U.S. military in 2008, Applicant possessed, used, and tested positive \nfor MDMA, a controlled substance also known as ecstasy. He had methamphetamine \nand drug paraphernalia in his possession when he was arrested in May 2019. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n25(a), 25(b), and 25(c) are applicable. \nApplicant was still in training in 2008. I am confident he was not granted access \nto classified information at the time. AG \u00b6 25(f) is not applicable. The language in SOR \u00b6 \n2.b that alleges \u201cwhile granted access to classified information\u201d is concluded for \nApplicant. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant denied knowingly taking ecstasy, and he denied knowledge that the \npills in his possession in 2008 were ecstasy. He testified that he was going through a \ndifficult time in his marriage, and he used methamphetamine on one occasion before his \n2019 arrest. He denied knowing that there was methamphetamine in his vehicle. He \ndenied any additional drug involvement, and he passed multiple drug tests between \nMay and December 2019. He stated that he took responsibility for his bad decision to \nuse methamphetamine, and he disassociated himself from anyone involved in illegal \ndrugs. \nAs addressed in the findings of fact. I did not find Applicant credible about either \nincident. He knowingly used ecstasy, had at least two ecstasy pills that he tried to sell, \nand tested positive for MDMA in 2008. He knowingly had methamphetamine in his \nvehicle in 2019. He intentionally provided false information about the 2008 incident to \nCID (false official statement), during his 2021 background interview, and during his \ntestimony, and he intentionally provided false information about the 2019 incident during \nhis 2021 background interview, and during his testimony. \nSince I cannot trust anything Applicant says, I also cannot find that illegal drug \ninvolvement is unlikely to recur. His drug involvement continues to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. None of the mitigating conditions \nare applicable. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct  \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability,\nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s\nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR cross-alleges Applicant\u2019s illegal drug incidents under criminal conduct, \nand it also alleges his arrest for failure to appear. AG \u00b6 31(b) is applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment;  \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant\u2019s explanation for his failure to appear is plausible, reasonable, and \naccepted. SOR \u00b6 3.a is mitigated. His explanations for his drug incidents are not \nplausible nor reasonable. The analysis under Guideline H applies equally here. His \ncriminal conduct continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, good \njudgment, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. The above \nmitigating conditions, individually or collectively, are insufficient to alleviate those \nconcerns. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \nclearance investigative or adjudicative processes. The following will \nnormally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, \nsecurity clearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national \nsecurity eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a \nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or \nreleases, cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or \npolygraph examination, if authorized and required; and \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative;  \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant intentionally provided a false statement in 2008 when he denied taking \nany of the ecstasy pills. He intentionally provided false information during his 2021 \nbackground \ninterview \nwhen \nhe \nstated \nthat \nhe \nwas \nunaware \nthere \nwas \nmethamphetamine in his car during his arrest in May 2019. AG \u00b6 16(b) is applicable to \nboth false statements. \nSOR \u00b6 4.c alleges that Applicant intentionally provided false information during \nhis 2021 background interview when he stated the June 2019 arrests for failure to \nappear were for the same incident. There is insufficient evidence for a finding that it was \nan intentionally false statement. AG \u00b6 16(b) is not applicable to that statement. SOR \u00b6 \n4.c is concluded for Applicant.  \nSOR \u00b6 4.d cross-alleges the drug involvement and criminal conduct as personal \nconduct. Applicant\u2019s conduct reflects questionable judgment and an unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. It also created vulnerability to exploitation, \nmanipulation, and duress. AG \u00b6 16(e) is applicable. AG \u00b6 16(c) is not perfectly \napplicable because Applicant\u2019s conduct is sufficient for an adverse determination under \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe drug involvement and substance misuse and the criminal conduct guidelines. \nHowever, the general concerns about questionable judgment and an unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations contained in AG \u00b6\u00b6 15 and 16(c) are established. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur;  \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nPersonal conduct security concerns are not mitigated under the same analyses \naddressed above under Guidelines H and J. Additionally, having determined that \nApplicant intentionally provided false information in an attempt to mislead the \ngovernment, I have also determined that his testimony about those statements was also \nfalse. It would be inconsistent to find his conduct mitigated.1 \n1 See ISCR Case 03-22819 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 20, 2006), in which the Appeal Board reversed the \nAdministrative Judge\u2019s decision to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance: \n \nOnce the Administrative Judge found that Applicant deliberately falsified a security \nclearance application in September 2002, the Judge could not render a favorable security \nclearance decision without articulating a rational basis for why it would be clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant \ndespite the falsification. Here, the Judge gives reasons as to why he considers the \nfalsification mitigated under a \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis, namely that Applicant has \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant defaulted on an auto loan, a consumer loan, and payments to a \ntelecommunications company. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) are applicable. \nApplicant stated that the $3,069 collection account to a bank (SOR \u00b6 1.a) was \nused to buy an engagement ring for his second wife. She refused to return the ring after \nthey separated, and she told him that she lost the ring. He unsuccessfully disputed it \nwith the credit reporting agencies. There is some precedent for a fianc\u00e9e to return an \nengagement ring if the marriage does not take place, but in general once there is a \nmarriage, the ring belongs to the wife. Moreover, even if there was a legitimate dispute, \nthat would be between Applicant and his wife, not Applicant and the bank. He was \nunwilling to satisfy the debt regardless of the ability to do so. AG \u00b6 19(b) is applicable to \nthat debt. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \nmatured, has held a position of responsibility, recognizes how important it is to be candid \nin relation to matters relating to her security clearance, and has changed her behavior so \nthat there is little likelihood of recurrence. However, the Judge\u2019s conclusion runs contrary \nto the Judge\u2019s rejection of Applicant\u2019s explanations for the security clearance application \nfalsification. At the hearing (after earlier admitting the falsification in her March 2003 \nwritten statement to a security investigator), Applicant testified that she had not \nintentionally falsified her application. Given the Judge\u2019s rejection of this explanation as \nnot being credible, it follows that the Judge could not have concluded Applicant now \nrecognizes the importance of candor and has changed her behavior. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant testified that the vehicle had transmission problems, and his warranty \nwas not honored. He told a different story to the background investigator in 2021. In \neither event, the SOR \u00b6 1.c debt is resolved and mitigated. \nThe remaining two debts only total about $3,500. That would not be a significant \namount from a security perspective if I could accept Applicant\u2019s assertions that he would \npay the debts. I cannot. In October 2023, he agreed to make partial payments of $100 a \nmonth for seven months for the debt for the ring, with the first payment due on October \n20, 2023. He testified that he made the first payment, but he did not provide any \ndocumentary evidence. An applicant who begins to resolve security concerns only after \nhaving been placed on notice that his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the \njudgment and willingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her personal \ninterests are not threatened. ISCR Case No. 17-03229 at 6 (App. Bd. Jun. 7, 2019). His \nstated intentions to pay the two debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record \nof debt repayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nApplicant does not have a track record that would enable me to trust that he will \npay the remaining two SOR debts.

None of the mitigating \nconditions are applicable to the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b debts. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E, F, H, and J in my whole-person analysis. I also \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s favorable character evidence. However, he has multiple drug \noffenses, and he cannot be trusted to tell the truth. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the security concerns under Guidelines E, F, H, and J. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant (except for the \nlanguage \u201cwhile granted access \nto classified information,\u201d which is \nfound For Applicant) \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraphs 2.c-2.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline J: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 3.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 4, Guideline E: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 4.a-4.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 4.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 4.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

On November 8, 2021, the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF) submitted some interrogatories to him asking some questions pertaining to his \nfederal income return filings. He responded to those interrogatories on February 28, 2022. \nOn June 2, 2022, the DCSA CAF issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him under \nExecutive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \nand modified (Directive); and Directive 4 of the Security Executive Agent (SEAD 4), \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016) (AG), effective June 8, \n2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) \nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and detailed reasons why the DCSA adjudicators \nwere unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue \na security clearance for Applicant. The SOR recommended referral to an administrative \njudge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or \nrevoked. \nOn September 21, 2022, Applicant responded to the SOR and elected to have his \ncase decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. (Item 2) A complete copy of the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to Applicant by the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) on October 21, 2022, and he was afforded an \nopportunity after receipt of the FORM to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the \nDirective as well as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received \nthe FORM on October 31, 2022. His response was due on November 30, 2022. Applicant \nchose not to respond to the FORM, for as of December 19, 2022, no response had been \nreceived. The case was assigned to me on January 26, 2023. The record closed on \nNovember 30, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments, all of the SOR \nallegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.d.). He did not \naddress the allegations pertaining to personal conduct (SOR \u00b6 2.a.), and his failure to do \nso is registered as a denial. \nBackground \nApplicant is a 25-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas a production technician since he was employed in October 2020. He was previously \nemployed by other employers as a master builder (March 2016 until October 2020), and \nlaborer (June 2015 until January 2016). He is a 2015 high school graduate. He has never \nserved with the U.S. military. He has never been granted a security clearance. As of May \n2021, he was engaged but never married. He has three children, born in 2015, 2019, and \n2021. \nFinancial Considerations and Personal Conduct \nIn his SF 86, Applicant reported that in his 2018 and 2019 federal income tax \nreturns he \u201cfound discrepancies and a 1040X form will be filed and the difference will be \npaid upon request.\u201d (Item 3 at 34) On June 15, 2021, he was interviewed by an \ninvestigator with the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM). During that interview, \nApplicant admitted that he intentionally withheld some of his income on his income tax \nreturns, and that he was never caught. However, when he looked online and saw the \npossible consequences for lying on his income tax returns he decided to rectify the \nproblem. He reportedly addressed the 2018 income tax return with the assistance of a \nprofessional tax preparation company and submitted it to the Internal Revenue Service \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n(IRS) in October 2020. He estimated that he owed the IRS approximately $2,900 and was \nwaiting to hear from them in order to set up a payment plan. He acknowledged that he \nhad not taken any steps to correct his 2019 federal income tax return because he had \nbeen waiting to have a stable job before doing so. He explained that he lied because he \nsaw everyone else getting tax refunds and he wanted the money in order to pay off a few \nthings. He was only 21 and 22 years old at the time and admittedly not mature. (Item 3 at \n7) \nIn his answers to the interrogatories, Applicant acknowledged that he had made \nimmature and undoubtedly poor decisions to withhold a portion of his income on his 2018 \nand 2019 federal income tax returns. Although he claimed that he had filed the Forms \n1040X for both years, he failed to submit any documentation to support his claim, despite \nbeing asked to do so. His only submission was for a request for a transcript of tax returns \nfor the two years in question, dated February 28, 2022. (Item 4 at 3-4, 6) \nThe SOR alleged two still unresolved issues involving intentionally filing fraudulent \nfederal income tax returns for the tax years 2018 and 2019, as well two still delinquent \naccounts for unpaid income taxes for those two tax years amounting to approximately \n$6,500. In addition, there is the cross-allegation under personal conduct covering the \nidentical facts. \nIn his Response to the SOR, Applicant admitted intentionally filing fraudulent \nfederal income tax returns for the tax years 2018 and 2019 by failing to report his total \nincome for those two years, and that he owed the amounts alleged. He offered \u201cno \njustified explanation\u201d for his actions, but commented that his immaturity led him to be \nuntrustworthy. He claimed that he has already paid the IRS $3,000 towards the 2019 \ntaxes, but did not submit any documentation to verify his claim. He acknowledged the \nfederal income tax form for 2018 had not yet been processed by the IRS. (Item 2 at 1-2) \nApplicant did not report his net monthly income, his monthly household expenses, \nor any monthly debt payments. In the absence of such information, I am unable to \ndetermine if he has any monthly remainder available for savings or spending. There is a \npaucity of evidence to indicate that his financial problems are now under control, and it is \ndifficult to determine if Applicant is currently in a better position financially than he had \nbeen. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nnational interest to do so.\u201d (Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)) \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income   \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as  \nrequired. \nThe SOR alleged, and Applicant admitted, that he had intentionally and \nfraudulently filed false federal income tax returns for the tax years 2018 and 2019, and \nthat he was still indebted to the IRS for approximately $6,500 in unpaid income tax for \nthose two years. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f) have been established. As for AG \u00b6 19(b), \nthere is evidence that his actions were to enable him to keep some money to pay off bills, \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand that is sufficient evidence to establish an unwillingness to satisfy his debts regardless \nof an ability to do so. AG \u00b6 19(b) has also been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nNone of the conditions applies. As noted above, Applicant admitted that he had \nintentionally and fraudulently filed false federal income tax returns for the tax years 2018 \nand 2019, and that he was still indebted to the IRS for approximately $6,500 in unpaid \nincome tax for those two years. He offered \u201cno justified explanation\u201d for his actions, but \ncommented that his immaturity led him to be untrustworthy. Moreover, other than a \ngeneral statement about filing one of the amended income tax returns, and paying the \nIRS $3,000 towards the 2019 taxes, he did not submit any documentation to verify his \nclaims regarding any corrective actions that he might have already taken. \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)).

Because of his failure to confirm payment of any of his delinquent \nincome taxes, and his failure to furnish evidence of his filing of accurate income tax \nreturns, the absence of verifying documentation leads to the conclusion that his financial \nproblems are not under control. He has not acted responsibly by failing to address his \ndelinquent accounts and by failing to make limited, if any, efforts of working with the IRS. \nThe Appeal Board has previously commented on such a situation: \nEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due \nto circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider \nwhether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing \nwith those financial difficulties. ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. \nJan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); \nISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-\n13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is whether he or she \nmaintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his financial problems only after being placed \non notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the judgment \nand self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate \nthreat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. \n29, 20/18); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018) In this instance, \nApplicant has failed to offer any verified evidence that he has even begun making such \nefforts. \nThe Appeal Board clarified that even in instances where an applicant has \npurportedly corrected his or her federal tax problem, and the fact that the applicant is now \nmotivated to prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration \nof an applicant\u2019s security worthiness in light of his or her longstanding prior behavior \nevidencing irresponsibility including a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. (See \nISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd.

They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. An \napplicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take significant \nactions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant immediately \nresolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously; nor is there a \nrequirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts, or \nresolution of such issues, one at a time. Mere promises to pay debts in the future, without \nfurther confirmed action, are insufficient.

Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 16: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative. \nMy discussions related to Applicant\u2019s financial considerations are adopted herein. \nApplicant admitted that he had intentionally and fraudulently filed false federal income tax \nreturns for the tax years 2018 and 2019, and that he was still indebted to the IRS for \napproximately $6,500 in unpaid income tax for those two years. He offered \u201cno justified \nexplanation\u201d for his actions, but commented that his immaturity led him to be \nuntrustworthy. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions support a conclusion that AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) \nhave been established. \nThe guideline also includes an example of a condition that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from personal conduct under AG \u00b6 17: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts.  \nWhile Applicant\u2019s initial acknowledgements were made to the OPM investigator in \nJune 2021, the issues related to his finances and personal conduct continue unresolved \nto this day. Applicant\u2019s actions under the circumstances continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 17(a) has not been \nestablished. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, \n392 (2d Cir. 1966); see also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006). \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s financial considerations. \nApplicant is a 25-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as a \nproduction technician since he was employed in October 2020. He was previously \nemployed by other employers as a master builder and laborer. In his SF 86, he reported \nthat he \u201cfound discrepancies\u201d in his 2018 and 2019 federal income tax returns, and in \nJune 2021, he told an OPM that he intentionally withheld some of his income on his \nincome tax returns, and that he was never caught. He gets some credit for initially \nidentifying his financial problem. \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial and compelling. Applicant admitted that he had intentionally and fraudulently \nfiled false federal income tax returns for the tax years 2018 and 2019, and that he was \nstill indebted to the IRS for approximately $6,500 in unpaid income tax for those two years. \nHis comments to the OPM investigator were not fully accurate, for his income tax returns \ndid not merely contain \u201cdiscrepancies,\u201d they contained intentionally false information. \nOther than general statements about contacting the IRS, making payments on his \ndelinquent income taxes, and filing an amended income tax return for one of the years in \nquestion, Applicant failed to submit any verifiable evidence in support of his claimed \nactions. There are lingering questions if Applicant is currently in a better position \nfinancially than he had been, as well as continuing doubt about his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \nApplicant\u2019s track record of zero verifiable efforts to resolve his financial and \npersonal conduct issues, the lengthy period of non-contact with the IRS, and his failure \nto be candid about his delinquent debts when he completed the SF 86, is negative and \ndisappointing. Overall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as \nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. Accordingly, I conclude \nApplicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations and personal conduct. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) (1) through AG 2(d) \n(9). \n10 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.d.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a.:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 34-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for his current employer since August 2021. He attended college for a period, but he did not earn a degree. He is married with two children. (Items 2, 3) Applicant had periods of unemployment and underemployment while raising two young children. He was unable to pay all of his bills, and several debts became delinquent. (Items 1-6) The SOR alleges five delinquent debts with balances totaling about $46,700. The debts include a charged-off credit card ($27,543), two defaulted student loans ($1,749 and $1,144), a debt to a collection company on behalf of a bank ($1,046), and a charged-off auto loan ($15,266). The balance on the auto loan appears to reflect the deficiency owed on the loan after the vehicle was repossessed. The debts are established through Applicant\u2019s admissions and credit reports. (Items 1-6) The two largest debts are to the same credit union. The $27,543 charged-off credit card was opened in 2018 and became delinquent in 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Applicant financed an auto loan of about $35,000 in 2018. The October 2021 credit report lists that loan as current with a balance of $31,432. It was voluntarily surrendered shortly before or after October 2021, resulting in the deficiency balance of $15,266 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). He financed another vehicle in September 2021, with a loan of about $35,000. He is current on this loan, and it was not alleged in the SOR. (Items 1-6) Applicant stated",

He has worked for \nhis current employer since August 2021. He attended college for a period, but he did not \nearn a degree. He is married with two children. (Items 2, 3) \nApplicant had periods of unemployment and underemployment while raising two \nyoung children. He was unable to pay all of his bills, and several debts became \ndelinquent. (Items 1-6) \nThe SOR alleges five delinquent debts with balances totaling about $46,700. The \ndebts include a charged-off credit card ($27,543), two defaulted student loans ($1,749 \nand $1,144), a debt to a collection company on behalf of a bank ($1,046), and a \ncharged-off auto loan ($15,266). The balance on the auto loan appears to reflect the \ndeficiency owed on the loan after the vehicle was repossessed. The debts are \nestablished through Applicant\u2019s admissions and credit reports. (Items 1-6) \nThe two largest debts are to the same credit union. The $27,543 charged-off \ncredit card was opened in 2018 and became delinquent in 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Applicant \nfinanced an auto loan of about $35,000 in 2018. The October 2021 credit report lists \nthat loan as current with a balance of $31,432. It was voluntarily surrendered shortly \nbefore or after October 2021, resulting in the deficiency balance of $15,266 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.e). He financed another vehicle in September 2021, with a loan of about $35,000. He \nis current on this loan, and it was not alleged in the SOR. (Items 1-6) \nApplicant stated that he was a scholarship athlete in college, and he signed \nsome loan documents without realizing what they were. He did not recall signing for the \ntwo defaulted student loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c), but he acknowledged they were his \nresponsibility. He thought the $1,046 debt (SOR \u00b6 1.d) to a collection company was for \na medical debt, but the original creditor was actually a bank. (Items 1, 3-6) \nBefore the SOR was issued, Applicant paid, settled, or brought current several \ndebts that were not alleged in the SOR. There is no evidence of any payments toward \nthe SOR debts. He stated that he intended to pay his debts. He and his wife are doing \nmuch better career wise, and they are more mature. His parents both served more than \n20 years in the U.S. military, and Applicant asserted that he would never do anything to \nbetray his country. (Items 1, 3-6) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including multiple delinquent debts. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), and 19(c) are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to periods of unemployment and \nunderemployment and raising two young children. His employment issues were largely \nbeyond his control. AG \u00b6 20(b) also requires that \u201cthe individual acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances.\u201d \nApplicant paid, settled, or brought current several non-SOR debts before the \nSOR was issued, which is a step in the right direction. There is no evidence of any \npayments toward the SOR debts. He stated that he intends to pay his debts. However, \nintentions to resolve financial problems in the future are not a substitute for a track \nrecord of debt repayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11\u00ad\n14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nApplicant may reach a point where his finances warrant a security clearance, but \nhe has not established that he is there yet. AG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in \nfavor of the national security.\u201d There is insufficient evidence for a determination that \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems will be resolved within a reasonable period. I am unable \nto find that he acted responsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith \neffort to pay his debts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to \ncast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(b) is \npartially applicable, but none of the other mitigating conditions are applicable. Financial \nconsiderations security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \ncircumstances surrounding this case.

I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be \nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive \nreliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in \narriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. .  .  . AG \u00b6 18. \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. \n2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

These debt delinquencies warrant \nthe application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the financial considerations \nguidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations.\u201d Each of these DCs apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nApplicant\u2019s admitted delinquent debts with explanations require no independent\nproof to substantiate them. See Directive 5220.6 at E3.1.1.14; McCormick on Evidence \n\u00a7 262 (6th  ed. 2006). His admitted delinquent debts are fully documented and create \njudgment issues as well over the management of his finances. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n01059 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004). Although he qualified his admissions with \nexplanations, his admissions can be weighed along with other evidence developed \nduring the hearing. \n \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical to an \nassessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in following \nrules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified information or to \nholding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23. \n2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nApplicant\u2019s cited limited resources as a one-income family played some role in \nhis accrual of so many delinquent debts over the past few years. Considering these \nadded financial burdens, mitigating condition MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in \nthe financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of \nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency a death, divorce or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d partially applies to Applicant\u2019s \nsituation. However, with his steady work over the past 10 years, he could be reasonably \nexpected to make more progress in addressing his delinquent accounts. \nFinancial advice offered by the lawyers Applicant has consulted does not enable \nhim to avert responsibility for addressing his debts with voluntary, good-faith payments \nof his creditors holding delinquent accounts. Deferring to creditors to pursue \nenforcement measures or relying on controlling statutes of limitation in his state of \nresidence to render the debts unenforceable do not represent the kind of voluntary, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n                               \n \n \n                  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \ngood-faith efforts required to mitigate financial concerns.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations that he used marijuana with varying frequency from about November 2015 to July 2021, to include after being granted access to classified information and that he had been arrested and charged with marijuana possession in September 2020. Applicant is a 24-year-old software engineer, never married, and has no children. He earned a bachelor's degree in August 2020 and has been employed by a defense contractor since August 2020. He received a security clearance in April 2020 and executed a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) two weeks later. (FORM Item 5.) When Applicant submitted his SCA in January 2020, he disclosed that he used marijuana from about November 2015 until December 2019. He did not answer the question on his SCA regarding the nature of use, frequency, and number of times used, and simply listed \u201crecently stopped\u201d on the line provided for the question. (FORM Item 3 at 23.)

He received a security clearance in April 2020 and \nexecuted a nondisclosure agreement (NDA) two weeks later. (FORM Item 5.) \nWhen Applicant submitted his SCA in January 2020, he disclosed that he used \nmarijuana from about November 2015 until December 2019. He did not answer the \nquestion on his SCA regarding the nature of use, frequency, and number of times used, \nand simply listed \u201crecently stopped\u201d on the line provided for the question. (FORM Item 3 \nat 23.) In response to the request in the SCA, for an explanation on why he intended or \ndid not intend to use marijuana in the future, he responded, \u201cCan hinder me from obtain \n[sic] security clearance and jobs in the future.\u201d \nIn response to DOHA interrogatories, he listed \u201csocially\u201d in the Frequency of Use \nbox. (FORM Item 4 at 8.)

(FORM Item 4 at \n6.) He also admitted in his ESI to using marijuana in July 2021 on two occasions and \nacknowledged he still associates with people with whom he used marijuana.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n3 \n\n \n \n Analysis \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admission in his answer to the SOR and the information in the FORM \nare sufficient to raise the following disqualifying condition under this guideline: AG \u00b6 25(a): \n\u201cany substance misuse (see above definition).\u201d \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 26(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b): the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security. \nNeither mitigating condition is established. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use did not occur \nunder circumstances making recurrence unlikely. He acknowledged his marijuana use in \nhis SCA and in his response to the FORM, but he continued his use of marijuana after \ncompleting his SCA and signing his NDA after being granted a security clearance. He \nstarted using marijuana in 2015, when he was 18, and has continued to use it until 2021. \nHe did not answer the question on the frequency of his use. He continues to associate \nwith those with whom he used marijuana. His actions after completing his SCA and \nreceiving his security clearance are indicative that not enough time has passed. See ISCR \nCase No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       Subparagraphs 1.a-b:  \n \n  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s long-term use of marijuana in violation of federal law raises questions \nabout his ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. He has not \nprovided a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and substance \nmisuse and acknowledged that any future involvement or misuse is grounds for \nrevocation of national security. Because he requested a determination on the record \nwithout a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his credibility and sincerity based on \ndemeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). Based on the \ntotality of the evidence, I am not convinced that he will continue his abstinence from \nmarijuana use once the pressure of qualifying for a security clearance is removed. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent \nto which participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline H, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by \nhis drug involvement. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(Tr. at 29.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. At 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd.

The following mitigating conditions \nare potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is established. Applicant's delinquent debts occurred as she was \ndealing with a failing marriage and leaving the military. These are circumstances that are \nunlikely to recur. She has established her reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment \nby providing evidence that all the debts are being paid off on a regular monthly basis or \nresolved. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) applies because Applicant's debts occurred due to circumstances \nbeyond her control. Her documentation corroborates her marital issues. She has \ndemonstrated that she has acted responsibly under the circumstances by taking her \nincrease in income from her veteran\u2019s disability rating and using it to resolve her financial \nissues. She has provided sufficient evidence to show that she acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances to resolve them. AG \u00b6 20(b) is established. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established. Applicant provided substantial evidence that as soon as \nshe had additional income she initiated and has adhered to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant does not present a perfect case in mitigation, but perfection is not \nrequired. Under the limited circumstances of this case, I find that her finances no longer \ngenerate questions about her judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. Security concerns about her finances are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Overall, the record evidence leaves me \nwithout questions or doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. I conclude Applicant mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nFOR APPLICANT \nFor Applicant  \n  Subparagraphs 1.a-i: \nConclusion \nIt is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

Applicant did not object. I have taken administrative notice of facts \ncontained in HE II, which are summarized below. \nPakistan \nPakistan is a federal parliamentary republic. It has been engaged in a decades-\nlong armed conflict with militant groups that target government institutions and civilians. \nPakistan\u2019s military has carried out three coups since Pakistan\u2019s independence in 1947, \nand as of 2022, remained a dominant force in the country\u2019s political arena. Its chief \nexternal focus was on the perceived threat from India and the implications of the fall of \nthe government in Kabul, but over the past 15 years, the Pakistani military has also \nincreased its role in internal security missions, including counterinsurgency and \ncounterterrorism. The Pakistani military establishment also has a large stake in the \ncountry\u2019s economic sector; through two large conglomerates, it is involved in a diverse \narray of commercial activities, including banking, construction of public projects, \nemployment services, energy and power generation, fertilizer, food, housing, real \nestate, and security services. \nThe separation in 1947 of British India into the Muslim state of Pakistan, with \nwest and east sections, and largely Hindu India was never satisfactorily resolved, and \nIndia and Pakistan fought two wars and a limited conflict, in 1947 to 1948, 1965, and \n1999, respectively, over the disputed Kashmir territory. A third war between these \ncountries in 1971, in which India assisted an indigenous movement reacting to the \nmarginalization of Bengalis in Pakistani politics, resulted in east Pakistan becoming the \nseparate nation of Bangladesh. \nThe U.S. Department of State travel advisory for Pakistan is \u201cLevel 3: Reconsider \nTravel,\u201d due to terrorism and sectarian violence. U.S. citizens are advised not to travel \nto several areas of the country in the Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa provinces, \nincluding the former federally administered tribal areas, due to terrorism and kidnapping. \nU.S. citizens are further advised not to travel to the immediate vicinity of the India-\nPakistan border due to terrorism and the potential for armed conflict. Though Pakistan\u2019s \nsecurity environment has improved since 2014, the presence of foreign and indigenous \nterrorist groups poses a danger to U.S. travelers to Pakistan. Terrorists have targeted \nU.S. diplomats and diplomatic facilities in the past.  \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nKidnapping remains a concern throughout Pakistan. Extremist groups and \ncriminals have targeted business owners and prominent families to finance terror \noperations and profit through ransom. U.S. and foreign nationals working for non-\ngovernment organizations have been targets, and U.S. nationals have been kidnapped \nin other countries and held in Pakistan. The U.S. Government has limited ability to \nprovide emergency services to U.S. citizens in Pakistan due to the security \nenvironment. \nPakistan experienced significant terrorist threats in 2020, with the number of \nattacks and casualties slightly higher than in 2019. Major terrorist groups that focused \non conducting attacks in Pakistan included Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and ISIS-\nPakistan. In 2020, Pakistan made limited progress on the most difficult aspects of its \n2015 national action plan to counter terrorism, specifically in its pledge to dismantle all \nterrorist organizations without delay or discrimination. Separatist militant groups \nconducted terrorist attacks against varied targets in Balochistan and Sindh provinces. \nThe U.S. Department of State has assessed Islamabad as being a medium-threat \nlocation, and Karachi, Lahore, and Peshawar and being high-threat locations, \nrespectively, for crime directed at or affecting official U.S. Government interests. \nSignificant human rights issues in Pakistan included credible reports of: unlawful \nor arbitrary killings, including extrajudicial killings, forced disappearance, torture and \ncases of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by the government or its \nagents; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary detention; political \nprisoners; politically motivated reprisal against individuals in another country, including \nkillings, kidnappings, or violence; arbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy; support \nto the Taliban, a non-state armed militant group that recruited and used child soldiers; \nserious restrictions on free expression and media, including violence against journalists, \nunjustified arrests and disappearances of journalists, censorship, and criminal \ndefamation laws; serious restrictions on internet freedom including site blocking; \nsubstantial interference with the freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of \nassociation, including overly restrictive laws for the operation of nongovernmental \norganizations and civil society organizations; severe restrictions of religious freedom; \nrestrictions on freedom of movement; serious government corruption; lack of \ninvestigation of and accountability for gender-based violence; trafficking in persons; \ncrimes involving violence or threats of violence targeting members of racial and ethnic \nminorities; crimes involving violence or threats of violence targeting lesbian, gay, \nbisexual, transgender, queer, or intersex persons; the existence or use of laws \ncriminalizing consensual same-sex sexual conduct between adults; restrictions on \nworkers\u2019 freedom of association; and use of the worst forms of child labor. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations in his Answer.

He was subsequently unemployed until July 2019, \nwhen he worked for a private company as a principal engineer until approximately 2021. \nHe also received an offer of employment from a DOD contractor in July 2019, \ncontingent on obtaining a security clearance. As of the date of the hearing and since \napproximately 2021, he has worked for another private company. He has never held a \nsecurity clearance. (Tr. at 7-8, 25-26, 29, 90-93; GE 1-2; AE I) \nBefore becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2016, Applicant was issued \nPakistani passports in 2003 and 2009, which expired in 2008 and 2014, respectively. \nHe was also issued a temporary Pakistani passport in approximately 2008, which \nexpired in 2009. He used his 2003 Pakistani passport to travel to Pakistan in 2005, to \nattend his siblings\u2019 weddings. While in Pakistan, he and his first spouse divorced. He did \nnot use his 2008 or 2009 Pakistani passports to travel. He was issued a U.S. passport \nin 2016, and it is not scheduled to expire until 2026. He used his U.S. passport to travel \nto Pakistan in 2021. He renounced his Pakistani citizenship in 2022, as further \ndiscussed below. (Tr. at 28-29, 58, 119, 125-126; GE 1-2; AE A, B) \nIn 1991, Applicant joined the Pakistani military to pursue a college education. \nThe Pakistani military covered the cost of his undergraduate tuition, provided him with a \nliving stipend, and paid him a salary. In return, he was required to fulfill a six-year \ncommitment upon graduation. After obtaining his bachelor\u2019s degree in 1994, he \ncompleted military training and was commissioned as a captain in 1995. He also \nunsuccessfully attempted, beginning in 1994 and then every two to three years, to \nresign from the Pakistani military. In 2003, the Pakistani government awarded him a \nscholarship to pursue his master\u2019s and doctorate degrees in the United States. In return, \nhe was required to work in Pakistan for two years. When he moved to the United States \nto pursue higher education, the Pakistani military placed him on \u201cfive-year study leave\u201d \nand continued to pay him a salary.

He chose to remain in the United States to complete his doctorate degree, \nand the Pakistani military consequently marked him as overstaying his leave. It ceased \ncommunication with him and terminated his military pay. He sent resignation letters to \nthe Pakistani military in 2008, 2010, and 2012, but received no response. In 2021, he \nreturned to Pakistan and paid the Pakistani government $12,000 USD for the military \nsalary he received while studying in the United States between 2003 and 2008. The \nPakistani military consequently accepted his resignation. He also renounced his \nPakistani citizenship and received a certificate of renunciation from the Pakistani \ngovernment in 2022.

(Answer; Tr. at 26-27, 32; GE 1-2) \nApplicant opened a bank account in Pakistan in 1999, through which he received \nhis pay from the Pakistani military. After the Pakistani military ceased paying him in \n2008, this bank account carried a zero balance, and he closed the account in 2009. He \nand his spouse do not own, and do not have any expectation of inheriting, any property \nor assets in Pakistan. As previously discussed, Applicant has owned his current home \nin the United States since 2020. His combined assets in the United States total just \nunder $1 million USD. He stated, \u201cThe USA is my home, the home of my [child] and my \nwife, and this is where I will be buried. If I must continue fighting to prove that I have \nonly one home, the USA, I will continue fighting.\u201d (Tr. at 30, 32-33, 48, 94-100, 127-131; \nGE 1-2) \nIn 2018, Applicant co-founded a non-profit organization in the United States. The \norganization is dedicated to promoting higher education among talented and needy \nstudents, to include individuals who graduated from the same college in Pakistan as he \ndid and who are pursuing higher education in the United States. He has since \nvoluntarily served as one of its directors. He received the President\u2019s Gold Volunteer \nService award in recognition of more than 500 hours of volunteer service to the United \nStates in 2022. (Tr. at 26, 29, 91-92, 100-109, 127; GE 1; AE A, F, G, H) \nThe individual who hired and has served as Applicant\u2019s manager since July 2019 \ndescribed Applicant as an \u201casset to any engineering organization,\u201d vouching for \nApplicant\u2019s valuable technical capability. Applicant\u2019s former director, to whom Applicant \nreported from 2010 to 2012, also attested to Applicant\u2019s valued technical expertise. A \nprofessor, for whom Applicant served as a graduate teaching assistant and graduate \nresearch assistant between 2003 and 2010, described Applicant as trustworthy. She \nnoted that he received a graduate award in 2009, and he was recognized as a \nmechanical engineering excellence teaching fellow in 2010. Applicant has authored and \nco-authored numerous publications since 2010. He also filed several patents from 2013 \nto 2015 and was issued one such patent in 2015. (Tr. at 29; AE I) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d Under Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting \n\u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by \nthe applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden \nof persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, \nand its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s \nfamily members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States. In considering the nature of the government, an administrative judge \nmust also consider any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR \nCase No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) (reversing decision to grant \nclearance where administrative judge did not consider terrorist activity in area where \nfamily members resided). AG \u00b6 7(a) requires substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened \nrisk.\u201d The \u201cheightened risk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a \nrelatively low standard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk \ninherent in having a family member living under a foreign government. \nApplicant\u2019s nephew, a citizen of Pakistan, has resided in the United States since \n2015. He obtained his bachelor\u2019s degree in the United States and has since worked for \na private company in the United States. In addition, Applicant has not had contact with \nthe Pakistani embassy representative or the other Pakistani government representative \nsince 2019. I find that none of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 7 are applicable \nto Applicant\u2019s nephew, the Pakistani embassy representative, or the other Pakistani \ngovernment representative, and I therefore find SOR \u00b6 1.c in part, and SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and \n1.i, in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nApplicant served in the Pakistani military from 1995 to at least 2003, during \nwhich time the Pakistani military paid for his college education in Pakistan. He also \nmaintained contact with three individuals with whom he served in the Pakistani military. \nApplicant\u2019s child is a resident of Pakistan, and Applicant\u2019s father, two sisters, two \nbrothers, mother-in-law, three brothers-in-law, and two sisters-in-law are Pakistani \ncitizens residing in Pakistan. Applicant\u2019s father served in the Pakistani military from \n1966 until his retirement in 1992. As of the date of the hearing, Applicant\u2019s one brother-\n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nin-law worked for the Pakistani police and Applicant expected that he would be \nimminently retiring. Applicant\u2019s other brother-in-law served in the Pakistani military until \nhis retirement several years ago. Applicant has paid $100 USD monthly in child \nsupport, through his father, to his former spouse for his child in Pakistan since \napproximately 2005, and he intends to continue to do so until this child marries. \nApplicant and his spouse maintain regular contact with their family in Pakistan, and he \neven saw some of them when he traveled to Pakistan in 2021. \nThough Pakistan\u2019s security environment has improved since 2014, the presence \nof foreign and indigenous terrorist groups poses a danger to U.S. travelers through \nPakistan, and terrorists have targeted U.S. diplomats and diplomatic facilities in the \npast. Kidnapping remains a concern throughout Pakistan, as extremist groups and \ncriminals have targeted business owners and prominent families to finance terror \noperations and profit through ransom. U.S. and foreign nationals working for non-\ngovernment organizations have been targets, and U.S. nationals have been kidnapped \nin other countries and held in Pakistan. Significant human rights issues remain in \nPakistan. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(e) are established. \nAG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in  \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nApplicant\u2019s child is a Pakistani resident, and Applicant\u2019s father, siblings, and in-\nlaws are Pakistani citizens residing in Pakistan. Accordingly, AG \u00b6 8(a) is not \nestablished for the reasons set out in the above discussion of AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and \n7(e). Applicant and his spouse maintain close contact with their family in Pakistan. AG \n\u00b6 8(c) is not established. \nApplicant has lived in the United States since 2003. After earning his master\u2019s and \ndoctorate degrees in the United States, he has since worked in the United States. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBefore he moved to the United States to pursue higher education, he unsuccessfully \nattempted to resign from the Pakistani military in 1994 and every two to three years \nthereafter. After the Pakistani military informed him in 2008 that he needed to return to \nPakistan, he chose to remain in the United States. He sent resignation letters to the \nPakistani military in 2008, 2010, and 2012. In 2021, he paid the Pakistani government \nthe military salary he received while studying in the United States between 2003 and \n2008, and he renounced his Pakistani citizenship. I considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s \nties to Pakistan against his ties to the United States. The concerns over Applicant\u2019s ties \nto Pakistan, through his family there, do not create doubt about Applicant\u2019s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect classified information. \nApplicant has met his burden of demonstrating that he would resolve any conflict of \ninterest in favor of the U.S. interest. AG \u00b6 8(b) is established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline B in my whole-person \nanalysis. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under this guideline \nand evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the foreign influence security concerns. Accordingly, I conclude \nhe has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant his eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all allegations of the SOR. He noted that SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f refer to the same real properties, 65 to 70% of the property is inherited and the remainder are rental investments he made from his savings in the United States (U.S.) and India. In his December 2022 answer, he estimated the total value of the property was $1,150,000. Regarding SOR \u00b6 1.g, Applicant admitted that he and his wife completed financial transactions of about $107,672 in 2020 to pay building contractors and material suppliers to construct an apartment building. He conducted about $160,000 in financial transactions in November 2017 and 2018 to purchase an Indian industrial shed. In 2012, 2013, and 2014, Applicant and his wife maintained a similar value in bank bonds to earn interest income. He transferred the bond value of $55,000 to the U.S. in 2021. As Applicant explained, the purpose of the Indian bank accounts is to manage his and his wife\u2019s income from India and to handle their property and financial transactions. (December 2022 answer to SOR at 1) No additional information was provided. Applicant, 49 years old, was born in India in 1974. He received an associate\u2019s degree in 1992 and a master\u2019s degree in 1995, before immigrating to the United States (U.S.) in July 1996.

Though India has a friendly relationship with the U.S., there is ongoing \nevidence that the country illegally pursues American technology. The country is among \nthe most active in US trademark counterfeiting and copyright privacy infringement. \nActive anti-western terrorist groups, including Islamist extremist groups target public \nplaces frequented by Americans and other westerners. As of October 2022, the \nDepartment of State issued a Level 2 travel advisory for American citizens to be \nattentive to crime and terrorism in specific areas of India. The Indian states of Jammu \nand Kashmir continue to grapple with terrorist and insurgent incidents. \nIndian security forces continue to violate human rights with extrajudicial killings, \ntorture, rape, and pervasive corruption at all government levels. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines, which \nare flexible rules of law, apply together with common sense and the general factors of \nthe whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

They may also be a national security \nconcern if they create circumstances in which the individual may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made \n7 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment \nof foreign contacts and interests should consider the country in which the \nforeign contact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, \nconsiderations such as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to \nobtain classified or sensitive information or is associated with a risk of \nterrorism. \nConditions under AG \u00b6 7 that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying include: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a \ncitizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by \nproviding that information or technology; and \n \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign owned or foreign operated business that could \nsubject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation or personal conflict of interest.  \nContacts and ties to family members who are citizens of a foreign country do \nnot automatically disqualify an applicant from security clearance access. As set forth \nunder AG \u00b6 7(a), the contacts are only disqualifying if they create a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation. As set forth in AG \u00b6 7(b), connections are only disqualifying if they \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between Applicant\u2019s security duties and his desire \nto assist his foreign family member. As the guideline indicates, the country in question \nmust be considered.  \nApplicant\u2019s mother, sister, brother, mother-in-law, and father-in-law are citizens \nand residents of India. He gifted his mother $20,000 in 2018 to pay for her post-surgery \nexpenses. He provided a total of $9,000 in 2020 and 2021 to his mother-in-law for her \nmedical bills. He and his wife co-own real property in India, including rental apartments, \na rental industrial shed, residential and agricultural land valued in at approximately \n$1,150,000. He has executed financial transactions from multiple Indian bank accounts \nat Bank #1 and Bank #2 in calendar years 2012, 2013, 2014, 2017, 2017, 2018, and \n2020, which are cited in Findings of Fact. He uses the Indian bank accounts to deposit \nhis Indian income and manage his Indian property and financial transactions. While \nIndia is referred to as the world\u2019s largest democracy, the country continues to have \nhuman rights issues, as well as terrorist attacks at tourist locations, transportation \n8 \n\n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npoints, and government facilities. This creates a heightened risk of foreign pressure or \ncoercion and a potential conflict of interest within the purview of \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(f). \nConditions under AG \u00b6 8 that could mitigate security concerns include: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a \nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests \nof the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of \nthe U.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for \nforeign influence or exploitation; and \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or \nproperty interests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and \ncould not be used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the \nindividual. \nThough India has a friendly bilateral relationship with the U.S., there is ongoing \nevidence that the country illegally pursues American technology, which engenders \nsecurity concerns about Applicant\u2019s ties to his Indian mother, brother, sister, mother-in-\nlaw and father-in-law. AG \u00b6 8(a) has limited application. AG \u00b6 8(c) does not apply \nbecause his foreign contacts with his foreign family members are not casual and \ninfrequent.  \nAG \u00b6 8(b) provides more mitigation than AG \u00b6 8(a) because of Applicant\u2019s \nresidence in the U.S. since July 1996. He received his master\u2019s degree from a U.S. \nuniversity in 1998, and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in November 2009. Based on \nhis ties to the U.S., there is an indication, though limited, to believe that he can be \nexpected to resolve a conflict of interest in favor of  U.S. interests. \nOn the other hand, Applicant and his wife have financial assets in India of \ngreater value than their assets on the U.S. He spent at least part of the period between \n2010 and late 2014, funding his day-to-day expenses through his Indian rental \nproperties. The record infers that he is still collecting rent from the Indian rentals at the \npresent time. In sum, the value of Applicant\u2019s and his wife\u2019s Indian financial interests \n9 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nraise a significant potential for a conflict of interest that increases his exposure to \nforeign influence or pressure. AG \u00b6 8(f) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI have examined the evidence under the foreign influence guideline in the \ncontext of the nine general factors of the whole-person concept listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \naccess to classified information must be an overall common-sense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines evaluated in the context of the whole-\nperson concept. \nApplicant is 49 years old. He was awarded a master\u2019s degree in 1998. He has \nbeen married to his wife, a naturalized U.S. citizen, since 2000. He became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen in 2009. There is evidence that he has worked for his current \nemployer since 2015, and evidence that he has worked for his current employer before \n2010. This evidence weighs favorably in his application for a security clearance. \nOn the other hand, Applicant\u2019s current ties to India are more substantial. He \nhas strong ties to his foreign family members both emotionally and financially. He and \nhis wife control a significant amount of land and other investment property that exceeds \nthe value of his American assets. They have multiple foreign bank accounts. \nConsidering the evidence from an overall commonsense point of view, Applicant has \nnot met his heavy burden of mitigating the security concerns raised by the foreign \ninfluence guideline. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1 (Guideline B): \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \n10 \n   Subparagraphs 1.a\u20131.g:  \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

The DCSA CAF acted \nunder Executive Order (Exec.

Department Counsel was ready to proceed on September 7, 2022. \nThe case was assigned to me on March 24, 2023. On May 30, 2023, the Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing would be conducted \nvia video conference on July 20, 2023. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 7 were admitted without objection. Applicant and one other \nwitness testified. After the hearing, he timely submitted by August 21, 2023, three exhibits \nmarked Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) A through C. AE A through AE C were admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on July 28, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 52 years old  He married in June 1992 and divorced in February 2018. \nHe has one adult daughter (28) from his marriage. He and his cohabitant have a 13-year-\nold daughter. He served on active duty in the U.S. Navy from December 1990 until \nDecember 2014, when he retired with an honorable discharge. He took courses from an \naviation institute from January 2015 until June 2016. At the time of his June 2021 SCA, \nhe was enrolled in a college. He was unemployed from January 2015 to October 2015, \nafter leaving the Navy. During that time, he was supported by his savings and did not \nsuffer any financial difficulties. Since December 2016, he has worked for a defense \ncontractor. He had security clearances while in the Navy. While serving in June 2010, his \nsecurity clearance was favorably adjudicated but with a caution to address his delinquent \ndebts. (GE 1, 2, and 7; Tr. 23-24.)  \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged 13 delinquent debts, 12 of which total \n$29,444. The SOR did not assign a value to the thirteenth, a foreclosed mortgage \naccount. (SOR.) The SOR is supported by the credit reports. (GE 4 through 6.)  Applicant \nadmitted those allegations with brief explanations. More specially, he admitted nine SOR \ndebts, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, b, d \u2013 g, and i through k, stating: \u201cWorking with [XYZ] Law firm and \n[the creditor] to rectify the situation.\u201d Those nine debts total $24,531. (Answer.) His \nAnswer stated that he \u201cinherited this [SOR] debt after divorce.\u201d That was clarified during \nhis October 25, 2021 personal subject interview (PSI), when he said: \u201cDuring the divorce, \nit was ruled that [he] was financially responsible for all debts.\u201d Because he had given his \nthen wife a power of attorney for when he was deployed in the Navy, he was unaware of \nmost of the delinquent SOR debts. He found out about his debts, when he applied for a \nloan and was told that his credit score was very low. He then pulled his credit report and \nlooked into his debts. (GE 2; Tr.16-17.) \nIn about mid-June 2010 while on active duty in the Navy, Applicant had his security \nclearance favorably adjudicated. That favorable determination, however, came with a \nwarning that he needed to keep his finances in line. (Tr. 24-25.) \nApplicant received the SOR in about June or July 2022, and when he answered \nit, he was working with XYZ Law firm to address the SOR debts. He testified that he paid \nthe firm about $187 per month for about four months. AE A shows four payments to that \nfirm of $109.95 from April 2022 through July 2022.

He learned, however, that the firm\u2019s purpose was not to pay his debts. The \nfirm was \u201cnot in the business of, actually, paying the debt\u201d but instead \u201cto . . . find ways \nto, or loopholes to, circumvent to improve\u201d his credit report. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t my intention.\u201d \nHe stopped using XYZ after July 2022. It did not resolve any of the SOR debts. (Tr. 25-\n29.) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through f, and i through k. \nApplicant stopped working with XYZ Law firm in the summer of 2022 and  \ncontacted by phone each of the SOR creditors. He explained that if he lost his clearance, \nit would be financially detrimental to him. If that happened, he would be released by his \nemployer. He could not guarantee those creditors anything. He made the same phone \ncalls the week of the hearing after speaking with Department Counsel. Only one creditor, \ndiscussed below, made him a settlement offer. All others wanted lump sum payments, \n(Tr. 23, 31-37.) He had made similar calls in 2021 before his November 2, 2021 follow-\nup PSI, but none of those creditors \u201cwould work a payment plan with\u201d him.  He plans to \npay off each account when he has the money to pay the account in full. (GE 2.) Those \naccounts are SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1,a through f, and i through k. Those SOR debts have not been \nresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g. \nThis is a charged-off account for $1,458. Days before the hearing, after speaking \nwith Department Counsel, Applicant telephoned the collection agency and arranged a \npayment plan. He is to pay a fixed sum monthly beginning August 1, 2023, for 12 months. \nAfter the hearing, Applicant submitted AE B, a schedule of 12 postdated, pre-authorized, \nand automatically withdrawn payments of $121.52 from his bank to the creditor. That will \nsatisfy the full balance. (Tr. 32-33.) This SOR debt is being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.h.  \nThis is a charged-off account for $1,218. Applicant had agreed with the creditor to \na payment plan, but it has not yet sent him a written plan, as promised. (Tr. 34.) \nThis SOR debt has not been resolved \nSOR \u00b6 1.l.  \nThis is a medical account in collection for $62. Applicant testified that this account \nhad been resolved, and he was to provide supporting documents after the hearing. \n(Tr.36.) No documents were provided after the hearing. This SOR debt has not been \nresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.m.  \nThis is property associated with Applicant\u2019s home mortgage account that was \nforeclosed in 2019.

That is consistent with \nhis testimony that the home sold for more than was owed under the loan. (Tr. 37-39.) \nThis SOR account has been resolved. \nFinances \nApplicant testified about the current state of his finances per month. Applicant\u2019s \nmonthly income (take-home pay $5,398 and VA 90% disability) is about $8,700. His \nmonthly basic expenses are about $4,775, leaving a net remainder of about $3,925. (Tr. \n41-43): \nApplicant has zero in his savings account and $25 in his checking account. He \nrecently had to replace his air conditioner, which cost $9,300. He did not have that amount \nin his savings account, so a friend lent him $1,700, to be paid back tomorrow. He gives \nhis net remainder to his cohabitant. \u201cShe is the mother of my child, she takes care of the \nhouse. She pays all the bills.\u201d (Tr. 44-45.) The smaller SOR debts range from $2,390 to \n$62. \nApplicant testified about the lump sum back payment of $14,034 he received from \nthe Veterans Affairs Administration when his disability was raised to 90%. He received \nthat in December 2021 and used it \u201cto resolve a lot of debts.\u201d His credit score went from \n420 to 572, which he said was \u2018still not that great.\u201d He did not resolve the SOR debts. He \nresolved \u201cimmediate debts, like payday cash loans.\u201d (Tr. 46-47.) \nCharacter Witness \nApplicant called Ms. ABC as a character witness. She has known him for a little \nover 23 years. They have worked together for the same defense contractor for the past \nseven years, since 2016. She understands his background in security clearances within \nthe military and within their current employer. She has been his boss at their current \nemployer. She understands what he has told her about his financial situation. While was \nhe still in the service, his wife \u201cdecided to take out a couple of accounts . . . in his name \nand not mention anything.\u201d The witness knows that Applicant went to court a couple of \ntimes to get \u201c[his wife] to own up and pay for some of the stuff she was obligated to.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s financial situation is getting better. The witness believes his credit score has \nimproved 12 points, then 20 points. He has been \u201cmaking strides.\u201d She does not think his \nfinancial situation was caused by his negligence or on purpose. (Tr. 15-19.) \nThe witness was in the U.S. Navy for eight years She did three cruises and was \nhonorably discharged for medical reasons. Applicant was one of her superiors in the \nNavy. He was her mentor, \u201ca guide to the Navy\u201d \u201cThe Navy decided they were going to \ncome up with this . . . Diversity Program . . .

As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n\u00b62(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, then the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel . . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion in seeking a favorable security decision.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nany questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n. . \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nApplicant\u2019s SOR debts are established by his admissions and the Government\u2019s \ncredit reports. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c) apply. \nAG \u00b6 20 includes the following conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nI have considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant\u2019s financial woes \nculminated with his divorce that was concluded in 2018. That is not that long ago. His \nindebtedness, however, is recurring; it persists to this day. His debts are not mitigated \nunder AG \u00b6 20(a). \nI have considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(b), which has two requirements. \nFirst, the conditions causing financial problems must have been \u201clargely beyond\u201d an \napplicant\u2019s control. Second, the applicant must have \u201cacted responsibly\u201d under the \nadverse circumstances he confronted. \nApplicant\u2019s indebtedness was incurred by his then wife, while he was in the Navy \non deployment. Using his power of attorney, she opened accounts that he was unaware \nof. He did not learn of those then delinquent accounts until he applied for a loan and was \ntold how low his credit score was. In the divorce case, he sought to have his wife held \naccountable for those debts. The court, however, ruled that he was responsible for all the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n. . \ndebts. The conditions that caused his indebtedness were \u201clargely\u201d \u2013 if not wholly \u2013 beyond \nhis control. I find no nexus between his June 2010 favorable clearance determination with \na caution about his debts and the financial circumstances that caused his current \nproblems. The first requirement of AG \u00b6 20(b) is satisfied. \nThe second requirement of AG \u00b6 20(b) is that Applicant \u201cacted responsibly\u201d under \nhis circumstances. Here, in late 2021 before the SOR was issued, he contacted nine \ncreditors to ask for settlement terms to resolve his debts. Those creditors refused, instead \ndemanding lump sum payments. Those creditors are noted in the June 8, 2022 SOR. He \nreceived the SOR sometime in June or July 2022. By the time of his undated Answer \n(likely sometime in July 2022), he had retained XYZ Law firm to work with him and his \ncreditors to resolve nine of the SOR debts. From April 2022 through July 2022 he paid \nXYZ Law firm $109.95 per month for its services. By the time he had made those \npayments, the firm had not resolved any SOR debts. Applicant was dissatisfied and \ndiscontinued XYZ\u2019s services. \nNevertheless, during the week of the hearing, Applicant again contacted the SOR \ncreditors asking for settlement terms, other than lump sum payments. Only one was \nwilling to allow him to make installment payments. After the hearing, he timely submitted \nAE B, which documented 12 postdated, pre-authorized, and automatically withdrawn \nmonthly payments of $121.52 to resolve SOR \u00b6 1.g. In sum, he made efforts to resolve \nhis debts after his PSI and before the SOR was issued. And he continued up to the \nhearing day. Given the uncooperative position of his creditors, he plans to pay off each \naccount when he has the money to pay the account in full. Under the circumstances, that \nseems like a reasonable plan. I find that he has acted responsibly in confronting his \nfinancial situation, and his debts are mitigated by AG \u00b6 20(b). AG \u00b6 20(d) applies for \nsimilar reasons. \nThe Appeal Board has held that it is not necessary to pay off all the debts alleged \nin the SOR, nor is it required that they be paid off in any particular way. What is required \nis only that an Applicant have a reasonable plan to pay off his debts,and has taken some \nsteps towards execution of that plan. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 09-08462 at 3 (App. Bd. \nMay 3, 2011). I find that the record evidence supports this conclusion here. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) \n(explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). In my analysis above, I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in \nlight of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nI have specifically considered the favorable testimony of Ms. ABC about \nApplicant\u2019s character. She has known him for over 23 years, beginning when they served \ntogether in the Navy and now as co-workers. In the Navy, she was in a subordinate \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n. . \nposition to him. Thanks, however, to a diversity program, they were paired as a team and \nfound they had much in common. A friendship flourished that continues to this day. They \nknow each other\u2019s families closely and have shared the ups and downs of life. As civilians, \nthey have worked for the same defense contractor since 2016. Now she is his supervisor. \nShe praised him for having the \u201cutmost honesty and integrity.\u201d \nApplicant leaves me with no questions about his eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. Therefore, I conclude that Applicant has provided sufficient evidence \nto mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.m: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(Item 7 at page\n4.) \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order \nadverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation,\nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides proof \nto substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to \nresolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts remain unresolved. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. While Applicant alludes to a period of \nunemployment, a condition beyond his control, he has not acted responsibly to address \nthe resulting debt. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is not established. Applicant has provided nothing other than his bare \naverments regarding his claimed disputes. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden to mitigate the financial concerns set out in the \nSOR. For these reasons, I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.k. against Applicant. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F; and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude that Applicant has significant past-due debts that he has yet \nto address. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue \nApplicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance is \ndenied. \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n5 \n",

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on March 25, 2020. On \nAugust 8, 2022, the Department of Defense (DoD) sent him a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guidelines F and E. The DoD acted under \nExecutive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, \nNational Security Adjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 24, 2022, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge.

He obtained a personal loan to be able to satisfy the judgment in \nthe amount of $17,000. (Tr. at 58, 59; GE 7 at 6.) He explained the six-year delay in \npaying the judgment stating, \u201cI had to find out exactly where it is, and it took some time \nfor [the Court] to call me back and tell me what I needed to know and send them a check. \nPlus, I didn't have the money to pay them at the time.\u201d (Tr. at 58.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.g: past-due account charged off in the amount of $3,851.

(Tr. at 63) \nHe intended to use the additional money from the second mortgage to get \u201ca clean start\u201d \nbecause they had been living beyond their means. (Tr. at 65; 77.)

(GE 1 at 20; Tr. at 65.)  \nSOR \u00b6 1.k: 2017 foreclosure and auction of mortgage accounts. During the \nexamination under Guideline E allegations Applicant was evasive in stating he was \nunaware whether the foreclosure happened. (Tr. 33-35.) He testified his parents bought \nthe house in 1992 and that his parents let his family live there. He paid the mortgages on \nthe house. Both mortgages appear on his credit reports. (Tr. at 63-65; GE 5 at 2; GE 7 \nat 9.) He explained \u201cWe paid the mortgage, and then I took out a second mortgage on \nthat house when we got in a financial situation. We were current with the first one. The \nsecond one, I let it lapse.\u201d (Tr. at 63.) He could not recall when he let the mortgage lapse, \nwhich according to the credit reports was in March 2014. (Tr. at 64; GE 5; GE 7 at 9.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.l: filed for Chapter 13 Bankruptcy in about 2004, which was\ndischarged in 2007.\n \n Applicant in his Answer admitted the bankruptcy. He stated he and \nhis wife had been living beyond their means. (Tr. at 46; GE 4.) \nAfter receiving the SOR Applicant hired a law firm in September 2022 to represent \nhim concerning the negative credit items. (Answer Exhibit.) At the hearing he \nacknowledged the law firm had not resolved any SOR accounts. (Tr. at 48.) \nApplicant discussed taking out a personal loan to settle SOR \u00b6 1.f. The total \namount of the loan was $17,000. He used a portion of the remainder of the loan to pay \noff a $5,000 debt with his sister that he incurred getting his teeth fixed in 2015. The \nremaining $7,000 went to settling other personal debt. The interest rate on the loan is \n26.5 percent. (Tr. at 83.)  \nApplicant admitted: \n\u2026 all my life since I got married, we were constantly in, like I said, we \noverspend. We got a lot of credit cards. We overspend. We lived beyond \nour [two] means, and we had gotten in credit card trouble, all this stuff. And \nthen I took out the second one so we can get ahead of ourselves. I did not \nrealize that I was going to lose my job. Otherwise, I would have kept paying \nthe second mortgage and the first one, all this stuff, but I lost my job.

(GE 2 at 18.) Government Exhibit 7 shows no \ndelinquent accounts on his current credit report. \nGuideline E \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b. The Guideline E allegations stem from his failure to disclose \nthat information as set forth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.h, and 1.j regarding whether a judgment had \nbeen entered against him and his failure to disclose that information as set forth in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.k, whether he had any property repossessed or foreclosed, defaulted on \nany loan, or had an account or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing \nto pay as agreed. In his Answer Applicant stated \u201cWhen I fill[ed] out the [SCA] I did make \na mistake in filling it out but after I submitted [it,] I realized I had made a mistake and when \nI spoke with the investigator I did admit to the mistake and went over my credit history.\u201d \n(Answer.) \nDuring his security clearance interview he told the investigator that he was doing \nfine financially. He told the investigator he was meeting all his financial obligations. He \nresponded, no to the investigator as whether he was more than 120 days delinquent on \nany debt and whether he was involved in any credit counseling. He also responded, no \nas to whether he had any judgments or foreclosures against him. After these responses, \nthe investigator confronted him with the numerous debts and judgments set forth in SOR \n\u00b6 1. (GE 2 at 9-10, 17-19.) \nApplicant testified he had \u201cheavy thoughts\u201d about how he answered his SCA \nquestions.

He testified he was going to \ngo back in and resubmit it, but by the time he decided to do that, the investigator called \nand said he wanted to talk to him about his security clearance. (Tr. at 32.) \nApplicant was evasive stating he was unaware that the 2017 foreclosure \nhappened. After being asked again if he knew his house had been foreclosed on, he \nstated he assumed it was a short sale. (Tr. at 32-37.) Applicant initially denied receiving \n$97,000 back after both mortgages were paid off from the foreclosure until confronted by \nDepartment Counsel. He said the $97,000 went to paying off all the other creditors he \nand his wife owed. (Tr. at 37.) \nApplicant\u2019s wife testified that she let her husband \u201cdecide all those things\u201d when it \ncame to the foreclosure and the past debts.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

See ISCR Case No. 02\u00ad\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence admitted into evidence \nestablish the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability \nto satisfy debts\u201d); and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d) \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear\nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant admits his history of living beyond his \nmeans goes back as far as when he got married. His debts are numerous, recent, and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nwere not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is partially established. Applicant did experience periods of \nunemployment and his wife\u2019s barber shop business was negatively impacted by the \nCOVID-19 pandemic. He does support his testimony that he paid certain debts after the \nsecurity clearance process had been initiated and has offered to resolve others. AG \u00b6 \n20(b) requires that \u201cthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d His \nintentions to resolve financial problems in the future are not a substitute for a track record \nof debt repayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. There is insufficient evidence that Applicant has \ninitiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts. While he has apparently resolved other unlisted debts through a personal \nloan and the proceeds from the foreclosure sale there is no evidence these actions were \npart of a plan he initiated. The law firm he hired after the SOR was issued has not resolved \nany SOR account. See, e.g., ISCR Case No.12-01664 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014). The \nDirective does not define the term \u201cgood faith.\u201d Good faith \u201crequires a showing that a \nperson acted in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence honesty, and adherence to \nduty or obligation.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001). \nNone of these mitigating conditions are established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts \nare recent, numerous, and were not incurred under circumstances making them unlikely \nto recur. Applicant went through bankruptcy in 2004 and his financial condition since 2014 \nhas been poor. He has had a significant amount of delinquent debt for several years, \ndebts which he only began seriously to address when the clearance application process \ncommenced. In addition, those debts that he has resolved were addressed through \ninvoluntary means such as wage garnishment and foreclosure. Applicant\u2019s circumstances \nraise serious concerns about his judgment and reliability, concerns which cannot be \nsuccessfully mitigated by the debts he mitigated after his security clearance interview. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 16(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a references whether he deliberately failed to disclose the judgments set \nforth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.h, and 1.j. The record supports he specifically withheld this \ninformation. He said he mistakenly  failed to disclose these judgments in his Answer and \nin his testimony. The financial questions on the SCA are straight forward and easy to \nunderstand. \n\u201cApplicant\u2019s statements about his intent and state of mind when he executed his \nSecurity Clearance Application were relevant evidence, but they were not binding on the \nAdministrative Judge.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-09488 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2006) (citation \nomitted). In ADP Case No. 17-03932 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 14, 2019) the Appeal Board \nrecognized the importance of circumstantial evidence of intent in falsification cases: \nWhen evaluating the deliberate nature of an alleged falsification, a Judge \nshould consider the applicant\u2019s mens rea in light of the entirety of the record \nevidence. See, e.g., ADP Case No. 15-07979 at 5 (App. Bd. May 30, 2017). \nAs a practical matter, a finding regarding an applicant\u2019s intent or state of \nmind may not always be based on an applicant\u2019s statements, but rather may \nrely on circumstantial evidence. Id. \nApplicant knew about the judgments. I am not convinced Applicant honestly \nanswered the questions on his SCA about the judgments. He elected not to disclose his \njudgments. The record evidence establishes AG \u00b6 16(a) in relation to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.h, \nand 1.j. \nSOR \u00b6 2.b references whether he deliberately failed to the accounts set forth in \nsubparagraphs 1.a through 1.k. The record supports he specifically knew he had \ndefaulted on a loan, \u201chad these specific bills or debts turned over to a collection agency\u201d \nor \u201chad any of these accounts charged off or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed.\u201d AG \n\u00b6 16(a) is applicable to SOR \u00b6 2.b.  \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; and \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n          \n \n        \n \n \n                \n                        \n                    \n \n \nNeither mitigating condition is established for either allegation. Applicant made no \neffort to correct the omissions in his SCA until he was confronted with them during the \nApril 2020 security clearance interview. Falsification of a security clearance application \n\u201cstrikes at the heart of the security clearance process.\u201d ISCR Case No. 09-01652 (App. \nBd. Aug. 8, 2011.) I am satisfied that Applicant knew he had delinquent debts and a \njudgment when he submitted his SCA, and he deliberately chose not to disclose them. \nHis false statements on his SCA cast doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. Personal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nApplicant was evasive in his testimony and did not act on his debts until after the \nsecurity clearance application process had been initiated. After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines F and E and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, and mindful of my obligation to resolve close cases in favor \nof national security, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns about \nfinancial considerations or his personal conduct. Accordingly, I conclude he has not \ncarried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nhim eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h-1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \n10 \n Subparagraphs 1.a, 1.c, 1.d: \n    Subparagraphs 1.b, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g:  \n\n \n \n \n \n                     \n                   \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \n Subparagraphs 2.a-2.b:  \n \n \n \n Against Applicant \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

She seeks a clearance in conjunction with her current employment. (Item 2) [Note \u2013 In her response to the FORM, Applicant submitted a draft copy of a letter of resignation to her employer. She stated that she had not submitted that letter pending a meeting with her contract manager. (Items 6, 21)] Applicant graduated from high school in June 1988. She was awarded an associate degree and a certificate in radiation technology in May 1995. Applicant was married from July 1992 to July 1996. That marriage ended by divorce.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a clearance favorable \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d The record established the disqualifying conditions in \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \nmitigating conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 lists potential mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability \nof mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \n\u00b6\u00b6eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or \nmaintenance of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d \n1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the \nGovernment presents evidence raising security concerns, the burden \nshifts to the applicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15. The standard applicable in security clearance decisions is that \narticulated in Egan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being \nconsidered for access to classified information will be resolved in favor of \nthe national security.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nApplicant is able to receive full credit under AG 20(d) with regard to the debts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n and 1.p, debts that she settled for lesser amounts. With regard to the \nremaining SOR debts, AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b) and 20(d) are partially applicable. However, full \ncredit under these mitigating conditions is not warranted given the fact that Applicant \nfailed to act responsibly and neglected to remain in contact with her creditors. Some \ncircumstances \nadversely \naffected \nher \nfinances, \nincluding \nher \nspouse\u2019s \nunderemployment and the assistance her homeless stepfather required. However, she \nonly began to make payments long after her accounts were delinquent. \nThe evidence does not support application of any of the other potential mitigating \nconditions. Applcant\u2019s financial delinquencies are ongoing and she has not established \nthat her debts are being resolved or are under control. Nor did she document that any of \nthe remaining debts are not her responsibility. \nPersonal Conduct \nApplicant admitted that when she completed her SF-86, she failed to provide \ncomplete or accurate information regarding her financial situation. She added that she \nbecame confused when completing her SF-86. I also note that she made numerous \nother mistakes or failed to report required information when completing her SF-86. She \ndiscussed these shortcomings during her OPM PSIs. Applicant\u2019s confusion and lack of \nattention to detail cannot be construed as a willful and deliberate attempt to undermine \nthe investigative process. Although the information she provided regarding her financial \nsituation, and other issues, on her SF-86 proved to be incorrect, I attribute these lapses \n6 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto carelessness and am satisfied that she did not deliberately and intentionally fail to \ndisclose her delinquent debts with the intent to deceive. \nThe Appeal Board has cogently explained the process for analyzing falsification \ncases, stating: \n(a) when a falsification allegation is controverted, Department Counsel has \nthe burden of proving falsification; (b) proof of an omission, standing \nalone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind \nwhen the omission occurred; and (c) a Judge must consider the record \nevidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial \nevidence concerning the applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the \nomission occurred. [Moreover], it was legally permissible for the Judge to \nconclude Department Counsel had established a prima facie case under \nGuideline E and the burden of persuasion had shifted to the applicant to \npresent evidence to explain the omission. \nISCR Case No. 03-10380 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-23133 \n(App. Bd. June 9, 2004)). \nApplicant refuted the allegation of falsification of her SF-86. No disqualifying \ncondition under Guideline E was established in this record, so discussion of potentially \nmitigating conditions is not warranted. \nConclusion \nIn addition to evaluating the facts and applying the appropriate adjudicative \nfactors under Guidelines F and E, I have reviewed the record before me in the context \nof the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant has been gainfully employed \nfor the majority of her adult life, and she is presumed to be a mature, responsible \ncitizen. Nonetheless, without other information suggesting that her long-standing \nfinancial problems are being addressed, doubts remain about her suitability for access \nto classified information. As noted, personal conduct concerns were not established. \nProtection of the national interest is the principal focus of these adjudications. \nAccordingly, those doubts must be resolved against Applicant. \nApplicant chose to rely on the written record. In so doing, however, she did not \nsubmit sufficient evidence to supplement the record with relevant and material facts \nregarding her circumstances, articulate her position, and mitigate the financial security \nconcerns. She failed to offer evidence of financial counseling or provide documentation \nregarding her past efforts to address her outstanding delinquent debt. By failing to \nprovide such information, and in relying on an explanation lacking sufficient detail to \nfully establish mitigation, financial considerations security concerns remain. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.n: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.o: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.p: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

(Answer) The case was assigned to me on May 5, 2023. \nApplicant obtained an attorney, and after coordinating with all parties, the Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of hearing on July 18, 2023, setting the \nhearing for August 30, 2023. This hearing was continued for good cause at the request \nof Applicant\u2019s attorney. A second hearing notice was issued on September 8, 2023, \nsetting the hearing for September 27, 2023. The hearing was held as scheduled. \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 9; and Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through U. Except for GE 8 \nand 9 (see discussion below), all of the proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence \nwithout objection. I held the record open for two weeks in the event either party wanted \nto supplement the record with additional documentation. After the hearing, Applicant \ntimely submitted seven documents labeled AE V through BB. AE V through BB were \nadmitted, notwithstanding an objection made by Department Counsel, discussed below. \nDOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on October 6, 2023, and the record closed on \nOctober 18, 2023. \nApplicant\u2019s counsel objected to GE 8 and 9, which were unauthenticated \nsummaries of Applicant\u2019s background interview with a government security investigator. \nThe investigator was not called as a Government witness, and I therefore excluded those \nreports from being considered as evidence. During the hearing, I advised counsel that \nApplicant could be questioned about information he provided during his background \ninterviews, and Applicant could also choose to adopt any information reported therein. \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel noted a concern about the relevance of \nAE P, entitled \u201cHyperglycemia in diabetes.\u201d Applicant\u2019s counsel said he would address \nthis concern during his case. Department Counsel did object to the admissibility of the \npost-hearing documents of AE W, AA and BB, but asked that limited weight be given to \nthe articles about diabetic ketoacidosis. Applicant did not present medical records or \nexpert testimony to support his claim that he was, in fact, suffering from diabetic \nketoacidosis on the night he was arrested for driving while intoxicated in November 2021. \nI admitted AE W, AE AA, and AE BB into evidence; however, I made it clear that whatever \nweight I would assign these documents would be left to my judicial discretion. The email \nexchanges between the parties and the judge about the admissibility of these documents \nis admitted as Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant denied all allegations contained in the SOR except SOR \u00b6 1.d. (Answer) \nDuring the hearing, Applicant amended his Answer to change all of his denials to \nadmissions under Guidelines J, G and E. (Tr. 10) After a thorough and careful review of \nthe admissions, pleadings, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 54 years old.

(GE 1; Tr. 29-30; AE K) \nCriminal Conduct: \nIn order to keep the events in chronological order, I will reverse the order of the \nSOR allegations. \nApplicant was arrested in December 1990 and charged with disorderly conduct. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.k) He testified that he was staying in a dormitory when a fight occurred. The \npolice report in evidence showed that the victim specifically identified Applicant as being \none of the main assailants. The victim had seen Applicant holding a gun, thought to be a \nBB-gun, behind his back. The police found five rounds of .38spl, two WCC round nose \nlead rounds with brass cases, two federal round nose lead rounds with nickel cases, and \none Winchester .38+P jacketed hollow point round, in Applicant\u2019s pants pocket. Applicant \nadmitted that the police did find his bullets, but he claimed that his bullets were on a \nkeychain that had been discovered in his dresser drawer. There was no mention in the \npolice report that these bullets were found on a keychain or recovered from his dresser. \nApplicant admitted he had missed the original court date, and a bench warrant had been \nissued for his arrest. He was found guilty of an ammunitions violation and disorderly \nconduct. He paid restitution and a fine. He denied he had a BB gun or a pellet pistol the \nnight of his arrest. (Tr. 77-82; GE 2, 6, 7) \nIn September 1992, Applicant was charged with open container in a vehicle. An \narrest warrant was outstanding for Applicant\u2019s contempt of court charge, as noted above, \nand he was taken into custody. This offense was not alleged in the SOR. (GE 2, 6) \nApplicant was arrested in November 1991 and charged with aggravated assault. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.j) He testified that his younger sister had been beat up by a group of girls and \nreturned home. The parents of the girls came to his house to confront his sister. One of \nthe parents pushed his sister, so he got in the middle and he may have pushed the parent \noff of his younger sister. He believed a neighbor had called the police and he and one of \nthe parents were arrested. At court they both decided that they did not want to press \ncharges and the case was dismissed. (Tr. 74-77; GE 2) \nSOR \u00b6 1.i alleges that on September 14, 1992 Applicant was arrested and charged \nwith disorderly conduct. Applicant testified that he was in a group of eight friends, and \nthey had just finished watching a movie. They were in a strip mall playing around, acting \nimmature, and pushing each other when the police arrived and arrested them for \ndisorderly conduct. He was 23 years old at the time. They all appeared before the judge \nand were found not guilty. (Tr. 71-73; GE 2) \nIn about September 1996, Applicant was arrested and charged with disorderly \nconduct. (SOR \u00b6 1.h) Applicant testified that some of his family members were in the \ncourtroom because the defendant had killed his father after driving under the influence of \nalcohol. Some of the defendant\u2019s family members were also in the courtroom, and \nApplicant had witnessed one member shove his mother.

He explained that his second oldest sister suffers from bipolar \ndisorder, and she threatened their mother. Applicant and his brother told her to leave the \nhouse. His sister called the police and reported false accusations about him and his \nbrother. They were both arrested despite neither one of them had touched their sister. \nThe charges against them were eventually nolle prosequi. (Tr. 66-70) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges that Applicant was arrested in June 2007 for soliciting \nprostitution. He testified that an old female friend of his had asked him to meet with her \nbecause she had just learned that Applicant\u2019s mother had passed away in 2006. He did \nnot know that she was a prostitute. He met with her in his car in front of her grandmother\u2019s \nhouse. The police pulled up behind him, questioned them separately, and then informed \nApplicant that he was being arrested for soliciting prostitution. He claimed they had been \ntalking in the car for approximately 30 minutes. Applicant presumed his female friend must \nhave said something incriminating to the police for them to arrest him, or speculated that \nmaybe the police assumed he had been doing something illegal because they were aware \nthis female was a prostitute. Applicant stated the judge dismissed the charge against him. \n(Tr. 58-66) \nIn October 2010, Applicant was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol \n(DUIA). (SOR \u00b6 1.e). He testified: \nI fractured of a bone in my foot and I had a boot cast on. So I was going to \nCVS pharmacy to pick up a prescription. And as I was coming out of the \npharmacy, it was, a commotion was going on. I was in Chicago at the time. \nIt was commotion that was going on in that area. I don't know what \nhappened, but it was a commotion that was going on. Before I even got to \nthe car, the police had pulled, had stopped me before I got into the car. And \nas I didn't even get into car to drive it, they were saying that, you know, they \ncharged me with a DUI. (Tr. 52) \nApplicant stated that he believed he was arrested due to racial profiling, and that \nthe police officer did not even offer him a field sobriety test. Although there was no arrest \nrecord provided, a certified statement of disposition showed that Applicant was found not \nguilty of the DUIA. This alcohol-related arrest was not listed on his February 2022 SCA. \n(Tr. 54; AE E) \nIn June 2011, Applicant was arrested for driving on a revoked/suspended license. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d). He testified that although he was found not guilty of DUIA in May 2011, he \nwas unaware that his driver\u2019s license had been suspended following this arrest.

Applicant testified \nthat in February 2020, he resided with his fianc\u00e9e (F), his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s son (FS), the son\u2019s \npartner (SP), and the son\u2019s children. At the time, SP was prohibited by Department of \nChildren and Family Services from supervising the children. While F and FS were away, \nApplicant became upset that SP was left to care for the children. FS returned home and \nhe and Applicant got into an argument. Eventually F arrived home, and she called the \npolice to report that Applicant had just pushed her. She made additional false allegations \nagainst Applicant to police. He was arrested and charged with domestic battery. On \nFebruary 25, 2020, F filed for a protective order against Applicant. While an interim \nprotective order was in effect, F claimed that Applicant circled her residence in his car; \nhowever, Applicant countered that he no longer had the make and model of car F had \nidentified. (Tr. 35-52; AE C, D, V, X; GE 1, 2, 5) \nApplicant submitted documentation that showed his newer car, a Honda CRV, was \npurchased on May 6, 2020. He possessed his original car for over two months after the \ninterim protection order had been issued. On February 9, 2021, this arrest was alerted \nthrough the DOD Continuous Evaluation Program because Applicant had failed to report \nit to his employer, as required. In April 2021, over a year since his arrest and due to delays \nfrom the pandemic, the judge found Applicant not guilty of the two charges. In September \n2021, his ex-fiancee filed another protective order against him for allegedly making phone \ncalls. She failed to appear in court and the protective order was vacated in October 2021. \nApplicant listed this arrest on his February 2022 SCA. (Tr. 35-52; AE C, D, V, X; GE 2, 5) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges that Applicant was arrested in November 2021 and charged \nwith DUIA\u2013 2nd  offense,  improper traffic lane usage, and operating an uninsured motor\nvehicle. The police report disclosed that Applicant had reported that he was on his way\nhome from his sister\u2019s birthday party. Applicant at first d\n enied he consumed any alcohol,\nbut he later admitted to the police officer that he had consumed one alcoholic beverage.\nThe police report also disclosed that Applicant had participated in a breathalyzer test and\nappeared to have urinated in his pants. He was placed under arrest after his blood alcohol\ncontent (BAC) was measured 0.245%. Applicant\u2019s car appeared to have been involved in\na hit and run accident since there was significant damage to the front of the car, the front\npassenger tire was blown, and Applicant had been driving on the rim.

He was in a state of confusion and was pulled over by the police for driving \nunder 20 mph in a 45 mph zone. He did not have a sister who had a birthday during the \nmonth of November, and he admitted he was very confused when speaking with the \npolice officer. Applicant\u2019s counsel asked him if he was familiar with hyperglycemia. \nApplicant stated that this condition occurs when your blood sugar is not properly \ncontrolled with medication.

Applicant \ntestified that he had not consumed any alcohol that night or during the past 27 years after \nhis father was killed by a drunk driver in 1996. (Tr. 31-38; AE Q, R, S, U; GE 1, 2, 3, 4) \nApplicant testified that after the police dropped him off at his home he called 911 \nto go to the hospital. A blood sample was taken that showed his blood sugar was high, \nreportedly 126. He was held at the hospital for about four hours and released. He \neventually hired an attorney who recommended that he plead guilty to the reduced charge \nof reckless driving. In December 2022, Applicant pled guilty to reckless driving. He was \nrequired to enroll in an alcohol program, use an alcohol-testing device for one year, attend \na victims-impact panel, and pay fines of $2,502. His required use of the testing device \nwas later reduced to six months after he successfully passed all alcohol-breath tests. He \nwas also placed on probation for two years. (Tr. 38-43; AE A, B, D, F, T; GE 4) \nAt the time of the hearing, Applicant remained on probation, which was scheduled \nto terminate on December 6, 2024. He disclosed this arrest on his February 2022 security \nclearance application (SCA). He listed that the DUIA charge was pending and that he \n\u201cwas on medication for tooth pain from the doctor.\u201d There is nothing in the police report \nthat indicated Applicant had told the police officer that he was not feeling well or that he \nneeded medical attention. He had been taken to the police station following his arrest, \nand he had refused to provide another breath sample or answer police questions. After \ncompleting the booking process the police dropped him off at his home. Applicant testified \nthat he was very confused, feeling terrible, and he was likely suffering from hyperglycemia \nat the time of his arrest. Since he had not consumed any alcohol, he assumed diabetic \nketoacidosis could have caused him to provide a false positive on the breathalyzer test, \nbased on the medical reports and studies in the record. (Tr. 38-43; AE A, B, D, F, T; GE \n1, 4) \nApplicant testified that he did not specifically request any alcohol test or toxicology \ntests when he was hospitalized following his arrest. The hospital records reflected that \nApplicant had apparently complained of abdominal pain following a motor vehicle \naccident. There was no evidence that Applicant entered the hospital due to high blood \nsugar, tooth pain, hyperglycemia, or diabetic ketoacidosis. The medical records disclosed \nthat Applicant had no evidence of acute abnormality in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis \nfollowing a CT scan. His lab results showed that he scored within the normal range, low \nrange, as well as in the high range in several test areas. There is no documentary \nevidence that Applicant experienced, tested, or was treated for high blood sugar levels, \nhyperglycemia, or diabetic ketoacidosis. (Tr. 44; AE T, Y) \nThe medical information, studies, and reports in the record noted that \nhyperglycemia occurs usually when a person with diabetes skips insulin or other \nmedications prescribed to lower blood-sugar levels. It stated that \u201cHyperglycemia usually \ndoesn\u2019t cause symptoms until blood sugar (glucose) levels are high \u2013 above 180 to 200 \nmilligrams\u2026\u201d (emphasis added; AE P) The lab result of Applicant\u2019s blood sugar level \nfollowing his DUIA arrest was reported at 126.

(AE P) In this instance, Applicant had a tooth pulled on Thursday and on \nSunday morning at 4:30 a.m., he was arrested for DUIA and claimed he was likely \nsuffering from hyperglycemia. Based on this information it does not appear, nor is there \nany evidence to support, that Applicant was suffering from hyperglycemia at the time of \nhis second DUIA arrest. Applicant\u2019s systoms are consistent with a highly intoxicated \nindividual whose BAC was measured at 0.245%. (GE 4) \nAnother medical article described diabetic ketoacidosis as a severe medical \ncondition that is life-threatening. This condition develops after an individual suffers \nuncontrolled hyperglycemia. (AE AA) Because the record evidence did not establish \nApplicant suffered from hyperglycemia, Applicant similarly did not establish that he \nsuffered from diabetic ketoacidosis. Therefore, the discussion of this medical condition is \nirrelevant and not entitled to much weight in my decision. (AE P, W, AA, BB) \nApplicant was sentenced to enroll in the Level 2 intensive outpatient program \n(IOP). The one-page IOP summary from an addiction counselor stated that Applicant had \nsuccessfully completed the program on January 27, 2022: \n[Applicant] has been encouraged to regularly engage in community support \ngroup meetings (e.g. 12-step groups), get a sponsor; engage regularly in \nmental health treatment and continue to actively apply what had been \nlearned in group. (AE J, Z) \nThere was no diagnosis or prognosis given in the IOP summary, but based on the \ncomments provided, it appears that Applicant was treated for some type of substance \nmisuse. The addiction counselor\u2019s recommendation that Applicant participate in a \ncontinuing support group and obtain a sponsor infers that Applicant had misused some \ntype of substance. Applicant did not disclose this alcohol treatment, which he had just \ncompleted, on his February 2022 SCA. He did not provide complete treatment records \nexcept for the one-page summary. There is no evidence in the record that Applicant is \ncomplying with the addiction counselor\u2019s recommendations. (Tr. 44; AE J, Z; GE 1) \nApplicant has been employed by a federal contractor for six years. He stated that \nhe just recently found out that he is required to report any arrest to his employer. He \ninitially denied that the employer provided annual security briefings, but then he changed \nhis mind and admitted they do have annual security briefings. The reporting requirement, \nhowever, had not been discussed during those earlier security briefings. He did not report \nhis February 2020 arrest for domestic assault/physical contact, his August 2020 arrest for \nviolation of a protection order, or his November 2021 arrest for DUIA to his employer, as \nrequired.

Applicant also submitted several \ncertificates of achievement, recognition and awards from 2001 to 2006. (AE H, M) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions, which \nare useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states that an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that an adverse decision shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of \nthe applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline J: Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern related to the criminal conduct guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 \n30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 lists conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Three potentially apply: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness;  \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \n(c) individual is currently on parole or probation \nThe record evidence establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), 31(b), and 31(c). Applicant was \ninvolved in multiple arrests between 1990 and 2021, and he is currently on probation until \nDecember 2024. \nAG \u00b6 32 lists two conditions that could mitigate the security concerns: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s pattern of criminal conduct spans over three decades and raises \nserious security concerns. He remains on probation until December 2024 due to his \nNovember 2021 conviction. Insufficient time has passed to demonstrate that Applicant\u2019s \ncriminal conduct will not recur. Based on those facts, his criminal conduct continues to \ncast doubt on Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Applicant failed \nto mitigate the criminal conduct security concerns. \nGuideline G: Alcohol Consumption \nAG \u00b6 21 describes the security concern about alcohol consumption, \n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d  \nAG \u00b6 22 provides a condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying as follows: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual\u2019s alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder.  \nThe record evidence establishes AG \u00b6 22(a). Applicant was involved in two \nalcohol-related arrests in 2010 and 2021, and his November 2021 BAC recording was \nextremely high at .245%. There is no evidence he followed treatment recommendations \nfrom his Level 2 IOP treatment he completed in january 2022. \nAG \u00b6 23 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations;  \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \nApplicant denied that he has consumed any alcohol since his father was killed by \na drunk driver in 1996. When discussing his arrests, he denied responsibility or culpability \nfor almost every single arrest alleged in the SOR. When addressing his most recent \narrest, he claimed he needed immediate hospital treatment for his high blood sugar and/or \ntooth pain when he was arrested by police in November 2021. He initially denied drinking \nany alcohol but then he admitted to police he had consumed one alcoholic beverage. His \nblood alcohol content registered extremely high at .245%, well above the legal limit. There \nis no mention in the police report of any request for immediate medical treatment. \nApplicant reiterated that immediately following his arrest he went to the hospital to get his \nhigh blood sugar levels under control. The post-hearing submission of the hospital \nrecords does not support his testimony. The records clearly indicate that he received a \nCT scan on his chest, abdomen, and pelvis following a motor vehicle accident. There was \nnothing in the hospital record that indicated Applicant complained of symptoms consistent \nwith high blood sugar levels, hyperglymia, or diabetic ketoacidosis, provided test results \nestablishing these conditions, or has ever been treated for these conditions. Given the \npattern of discrepancies between the documentary evidence and Applicant\u2019s claims, I did \nnot find his testimony credible. \nNotwithstanding Applicant\u2019s completion of alcohol treatment, the addiction \ncounselor\u2019s aftercare recommendations support the conclusion that Applicant met the \ncriteria for some type of substance abuse disorder necessitating further care. He was \nencouraged to regularly engage in community support group meetings (e.g. 12-step \ngroups), get a sponsor; engage reguarly in mental health treatment and continue to \nactively apply what had been learned in group. There is no evidence that Applicant \nadhered to the aftercare recommendations. Based on him being an unreliable witness, \nthere is insufficient evidence to establish mitigation under any of the above conditions. \nApplicant failed to mitigate the alcohol consumption security concerns. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information \nsupports a \nwhole-person \nassessment of \nquestionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \n11 \n\n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n   \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nperson may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes but is not limited to consideration of: . . . (3) a pattern of \ndishonesty or rule  violations; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing . . . . \nAll of the Guideline J allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.k) are cross-alleged under the \ncurrent Guideline. Applicant\u2019s history of criminal conduct, two alcohol-related arrests, and \nprobation until December 2024 support application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(d)(3) and16(e)(1). \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant is not a credible witness. His failure to accept responsibility for his \nmisconduct and his misrepresentation of relevant facts indicate that he may be personally \nor professionally vulnerable if his criminal and alcohol-related misconduct were known to \nthe community. Overall, he has shown little remorse or rehabilitation following his pattern \nof rule violations, and his behavior continues to cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness and good judgment. None of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant \nhas failed to mitigate personal conduct security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) \nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines J, G, and E into my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant was arrested on at least 11 occasions over three decades. He is \ncurrently on probation until December 2024. He has not been candid about the \ncircumstances of his criminal and alcohol-related offenses. I find that more time is \nrequired without repeat offenses before Applicant can be considered successfully \nrehabilitated. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \narising under the criminal conduct, alcohol consumption and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through  1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance. National security eligibility is denied. \nPamela Benson \nAdministrative Judge \n13 \n",

(Tr. 15-21; Response to SOR; GE 1; \nAE B; AE I) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant has a history of mental health issues which raise \na security concern, to include: \n1.a In September 2017, Applicant was admitted for mental health treatment at \n[Redacted for Privacy] Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center for five days inpatient \ntreatment. He was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, recurrent, moderate; \nsuicidal ideation; and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), chronic. (GE 1 at 37-38; GE \n2 at 8) \n1.b  Applicant received mental health treatment at the VA Medical Center from \nSeptember 2017 to April 2019 for treatment related to suicidal ideation and major \ndepressive disorder. The record evidence indicates this was outpatient treatment. (GE 2 \nat 5, 8; GE 6; GE 7) \n1.c In December 2017, Applicant was admitted to [Redacted for Privacy] Hospital \nfor three days for depression and suicidal ideation. He was diagnosed with major \ndepressive disorder, severe, recurrent, without psychotic features. He was discharged in \ngood condition. (GE 1 at 38; GE 2 at 8; GE 5) \n1.d Finally, Applicant was evaluated by a licensed psychologist on June 14, 2021. \nThe psychologist determined he had a history of persistent depression and emotional \ndysregulation, which seems to worsen in response to significant psychological stressors. \nThere was concern he was not engaged in psychotherapy nor receiving medication \nmanagement although he was open and eager to receive services. If Applicant was able \nto receive consistent therapeutic support, his prognosis would be favorable. His emotional \nfunctioning appeared to be contingent on the level of stability in his environment, as \ndisruptions in attachment have precipitated his emotional and behavioral dysregulation, \nleading to impulsive behaviors and safety concerns. At the time of the evaluation, he \npresented with stability in mood, with absence of clinically significant difficulties that would \ninterfere with his judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. However, to ensure his stability \nover time, engagement in treatment is recommended. (GE 3; GE 4) \nApplicant and his wife married in 2008. His deployment in 2010 was not good for \nhis marriage. He and his wife had poor communication. Applicant was unfaithful to his \nwife. His wife discovered he was unfaithful in April 2017. She moved out of the house in \nDecember 2017. The divorce was final in October 2019. Applicant became depressed \nbecause of the break-up of his marriage and sought treatment in September 2017 \nbecause he was having suicidal ideations. He made two unsuccessful attempts to kill \nhimself and realized he needed help. He was inpatient for five days and was put on \nmedication. He claims he never received a formal diagnosis, but admits he was \ndepressed.

He attended weekly single \nand group therapy. On occasion, he would attend bi-weekly. He felt the therapy was very \nbeneficial to him. It helped him move on from a period in his life when he felt isolated and \ndepressed. It also helped him deal with his divorce. The medication helped him stabilize \nhis mood and thoughts. (Tr. 27-29) \nOn December 24, 2017, Applicant was admitted to the hospital for depression and \nsuicidal ideation. He was diagnosed with major depressive disorder severe, recurrent, \nwithout psychotic features. Applicant testified he does not remember what happened on \nDecember 24th, other than it was a bad day. He woke up in the hospital. The episode was \ndescribed by medical personnel as transient global amnesia. The medical records \nindicate Applicant came to the hospital because he was depressed about his pending \ndivorce from his wife. At some point before going to the hospital, he texted his wife that \nhe was going to hang himself. He also believes he contacted his sister but does not recall \nwhat he told her. His sister called 911 and the police took him to the emergency room of \nanother hospital. He was transported to the treating hospital via ambulance. (GE 5 at 2, \n4; GE 6 at 43-49) He stayed in the hospital for three days. During his stay he spoke to a \ndoctor on two occasions and attended group therapy sessions. He was also prescribed \nmedication to stabilize him. He was discharged after three nights in good condition. Ms. \nR, his therapist at the VA, was told about this incident. His treatment remained the same. \n(Tr. 29-32; GE 5; GE 6 at 43-49) \nApplicant\u2019s therapy sessions at the VA taught him strategies on how to cope with \nhis depression and anxiety to include daily exercise and getting involved in outside \nactivities. He works out every day. Exercise keeps him motivated and stable. (Tr. 32-33; \nAE G; AE T). He is a member of an adult baseball team. (AE R) He also started attending \nchurch services again and participates in young adult gatherings to include barbeques. \nHe credits his brother and sister with providing support. (Tr. 33-35, 39; AE F; AE S) In \n2017, he did not have a good support network, he has worked on becoming more involved \nand now has a good support network. He also has a new girlfriend whom he has known \nsince 2019 but started dating in 2023. (Tr. 37, 46; AE Q) \nDuring his first hospitalization in September 2017, Applicant lost his right to own \nfirearms. In September 2017, Applicant petitioned the court for Restoration of Right to \nOwn, Possess, Control, Receive or Purchase Firearms. Before the hearing date, he met \nwith Dr G., a licensed psychologist, at least twice. Dr. G. assessed Applicant\u2019s mental \nhealth to determine whether he was capable of safely possessing and using firearms. \nShe prepared a report which was submitted to the court. The court found by a \npreponderance of the evidence that Applicant was able to use firearms in a safe and \nlawful manner and that there was no current danger to himself or others. The court \ngranted Applicant\u2019s petition on June 5, 2018.

(GE 2) \nPsychological Evaluations and Therapy \nAt the request of the DOD CAF, Applicant was evaluated by Dr. M.L., a licensed \nclinical psychologist, on June 14, 2021. The evaluation was conducted on-line since \nApplicant is currently located overseas. The psychologist noted Applicant said he was in \ngood health and was not taking any form of medication at the time of the interview. He \nwas also not actively engaged in mental health services, though he reported interest in \npursuing psychotherapy supports. He stopped going to therapy in July 2018 when he \nrelocated to a new city and had difficulty accessing services. He was previously \nprescribed sertraline and fluoxetine for mood, and hydroxyzine as needed for sleep. He \nno longer takes medication. (GE 3; GE 4) \nApplicant reported a history of sexual addiction, which began in adolescence with \npornography. He spent approximately four hours per day online. From 2011 to 2013, he \nreceived treatment with a social worker. His sex addiction later escalated. He began \nhaving affairs during his marriage, which ultimately led to his divorce. He reported he has \nbeen \u201cclean and sober\u201d from his sexual addiction for at least three years. He credits his \nmeetings with Sex Addicts Anonymous as \u201ca big part of his recovery.\u201d He no longer \nattends meetings but has developed insight surrounding his patterns of addiction and \ntheir association with trauma and suppression. (GE 3) \nApplicant was described as \u201copen and engaged during the clinical interview.\u201d His \ncurrent judgment was assessed to be clear. His narratives during the clinical interview \nand documentation provided by the CAF were highly consistent. Dr. M. L. concluded the \ninformation provided during the assessment is thought to be a valid representation of his \ncurrent functioning. (GE 3 at 8) \nApplicant completed the Personal Assessment Inventory (PAI), a 344 item, self-\nadministered objective inventory of adult personality. Applicant\u2019s responses did not result \nin any clinically significant elevations across domains that would be suggestive of current \nclinical psychopathology. His results reflected mid-to-moderate areas of difficulty in \nregard to maladaptive behavior patterns aimed at controlling anxiety. It is consistent with \nwhat would be expected for an individual who experienced a disturbing traumatic event \nthat contributes to periods of distress and recurrent periods of anxiety. (GE 3 at 8) \nDr. M.L. concluded Applicant did not currently meet criteria for PTSD, though \ncomplex trauma is an important consideration in his diagnostic presentation. Dr. M.L. \nnoted some indications of borderline personality traits, but she would have to conduct \nadditional tests to make a conclusion. His prolonged emotional stability appears to be \ncontingent on the stability of his environment and relationships which warrants concern \naround his propensity for coping in response to stressors.

Dr. M.L was concerned that he was not engaged in psychotherapy or receiving \nany medication management, though he reported being quite open and eager to receive \nservices and has experienced barriers to accessing consistent care. With consistent \ntherapeutic supports in place to be able to manage his response to stressors in his \nenvironment, his prognosis is favorable. His emotional functioning appears to be \ncontingent on the level of stability in his environment, as disruptions in attachment have \nprecipitated his emotional and behavioral dysregulation, leading to impulsive behaviors \nand safety concerns. Applicant presents with stability in mood, with an absence of \nclinically significant difficulties that would interfere with his judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness at this time. However, to ensure his stability over time, engagement in \ntreatment is strongly recommended. (GE 3 at 10) \nIn May 2023, Applicant started attending online counseling sessions with Mr. C., \nMaster of Science (MS), Licensed Professional Counselor (LPC). Applicant meets with \nMr. C. once a week, provided it does not interfere with his work schedule. He is working \nwith Mr. C. on three goals. First, understanding and distinguishing past relationship \ndynamics to develop healthier relationship patterns in the future. Second, discussing \nways to cope and manage current relationship challenges in his life. Third, identify \nstrategies to help through various life changes and transitions. (Tr. 39-42; AE U) \nMr. C. provided a statement indicating that Applicant continues to engage in \ntherapy. He has reviewed and discussed tools to reduce frequency and intensity of \nemotions, create daily self-care routines, ways to build/maintain healthy relationships, and \nidentifying specific needs during times of transitions such as relocation, relationship \ndevelopment, and job changes. He has counseled Applicant on strategies related to self-\ncare assessment, values: self-exploration, meaningful relationships, grounding \ntechniques, sleep hygiene, and setting boundaries (communication techniques). (AE U) \nApplicant was provided a self-care assessment, Generalized Anxiety Disorder \u2013 7 \n(GAD-7). He measured on the GAD-7 assessment as \u201cno to minimal\u201d anxiety range. \nIndividuals within this range demonstrate minimal to no daily anxiety symptoms that would \nimpact their daily or executive functioning. He was also given a Patient Health \nQuestionnaire-9 related to depression. He measured in the \u201cno to minimal\u201d depression \nrange. This range would indicate an individual has minimal difficulties with elevated \nmoods being directly related to situational and/or expected stressors (e.g strained \nrelationships, work, society/cultural conflict.) (AE U) \nMr. C. indicated Applicant has made moderate progress since starting therapy. He \nstates adjustment disorder with minor depressive traits would be most aligned with \nApplicant\u2019s reported symptoms. He recommends Applicant to continue to engage in \nweekly/bi-weekly therapy sessions, addressing ongoing reported strain with stress, \ndifficulties with social/relationship situations, and professional challenges which impact \nmood and relate to transitions.

(Tr. \n40-41)  \nOn August 28, 2023, Applicant was evaluated by Dr. J.B.C., a licensed \npsychologist. The evaluation was conducted on-line. She reviewed Applicant\u2019s \nbackground history which is consistent with the record evidence and Applicant\u2019s \ntestimony. She also reviewed the 2021 psychological evaluation of Dr. M.L., who was \nhired by the DOD to assess Applicant\u2019s mental health situation. Dr. J.B.C. states: \nAs of this evaluation in 2023, the client does not present with any clinically \nsignificant difficulties, maintains a stable mood, engages in numerous self-\ncare techniques to maintain proper diet, sleep hygiene, physical fitness and \nemotional and spiritual wellness. Additionally, he is in routine \npsychotherapy and is engaged in a new relationship. He has gained a great \ndeal of insight into his own behaviors and how those affect others as well \nas insight into what precipitates depressive symptoms. (AE V)  \nDuring the clinical interview, Dr. J.B.C. noted Applicant\u2019s judgment is adequate and \ninsight is good. He was cooperative and friendly and did not appear to be making efforts \nat deception. (AE U at 3) Applicant completed the PAI, a 344 item, self-administered \nobjective test of personality and psychopathology. His PAI clinical profile is entirely within \nnormal limits. According to his self-report, Applicant reported no significant problems in \nthe following areas: unusual thoughts or peculiar experiences; antisocial behavior; \nproblems with empathy; undue suspiciousness or hostility; extreme moodiness and \nimpulsivity; unhappiness and depression; unusually elevated mood or heightened activity; \nmarked anxiety; problematic behaviors used to manage anxiety; and difficulties with \nhealth or physical functioning. He also reported no significant problems with alcohol or \ndrug abuse or dependence. (AE V at 3) \nDr. J.B.C. notes there was an elevation on the anxiety-related disorder scale-\ntraumatic stress. She notes it is a one scale elevation and not an overall pattern. She \ndiscussed lingering traumatic stressors with Applicant, specifically some of the events \nthat occurred during his deployment to Iraq which trouble him at times. While not \nphysically injured, he was exposed to nearly daily rocket attacks. He had a close call \nwhen one landed just outside the entrance to the dining hall while he was finishing lunch. \n(AE V at 4) \nApplicant also completed the SPECTRA: Indices of Psychopathology, a brief 96-\nitem self-administered, multiscale measure of psychopathology and functioning. His \nscore was within normal limits. (AE V at 4) \nDr. J.B.C. concludes that based on available past medical and current data, \nApplicant qualifies for a diagnosis of major depressive order, recurrent, in full remission. \nShe opines Applicant does not present with any conditions at this time that could pose a \nsignificant risk to his judgment, reliability or trustworthiness.

(AE V at 4) \nApplicant has had no incidents since December 2017. He is still working on issues \nrelated to his divorce, but believes he is doing well. He believes treatment has helped a \nlot. (Tr. 41-42) \nMatters Not Alleged in the SOR \nDepartment Counsel questioned Applicant about several matters that were not \nalleged in the SOR. Because they are not alleged in the SOR, these matters are not \nconsidered as disqualifying conduct, though they may be considered to evaluate evidence \nof extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances, to consider whether an applicant \nhas demonstrated successful rehabilitation, or as part of a whole-person analysis. ISCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct 26, 2016). I will consider these unalleged matters, \naccordingly. \nIn 2014, while on active duty, a new First Sergeant came to Applicant\u2019s unit. \nApplicant did not get along with him. The First Sergeant wrote him up for failure to obey \norders. Applicant had an agreement with the previous First Sergeant that he could leave \nwork early on Wednesdays to attend his bowling league. He continued to leave early on \nWednesdays. It is not clear whether he sought authorization from his new First Sergeant. \nHe was written up for leaving work early without prior authorization. (GE 1 at 17; GE 2 at \n7) \nIn April 2018, Applicant was written up at his civilian job for performing an action \nwithout a verifier present. The action required a person to take the action and another \nperson to verify the action. Applicant had just started a new medication and was \nexperiencing side effects including drowsiness.  He performed the action on his own. He \nadmits his actions could have caused damage. He received a warning for this violation. \nApplicant switched medications and became more careful with following policies and \nregulations. (Tr. 49; GE 1 at 15; GE 2 at 7) \nIn May 2018, Applicant and three co-workers were written up and suspended from \nwork for not clicking on the satellite prompt that said \u201cenable.\u201d He and his co-workers \nread the prompt as saying \u201cenabled.\u201d He was suspended for three days.

Applicant had the opportunity to appeal this action but opted to be transferred \nto the IRR. (GE 8) Applicant testified that he stopped attending drills when he moved to \nanother city and his work schedule conflicted with drill weekends. (Tr. 52-53) I conclude \nthis action does not have security significance. \nWhole-Person Evidence  \nSeveral friends and colleagues wrote letters of support for Applicant. Mr. J.C., \nApplicant\u2019s current supervisor, has worked with him since March 2021. He notes that \nApplicant has been recognized on two occasions for his outstanding performance. He \nachieved a satisfactory score for a COMSEC folder inspection. The inspecting unit \nmentioned that \u201cThe [Unit] team maintains an exemplary COMSEC program.\u201d He was a \nmember of a two-person team which successfully implemented a \u201cMilstar Network \nCutover event\u201d. His efforts ensured the network event transitioned on schedule with no \nimpact to the mission critical communications system. Mr. J.C. concludes by saying that \nApplicant exemplifies what it means to be dedicated to the mission and takes extreme \npride in his work. He has become a valuable asset to the team in a short amount of time. \n(AE A) \nDr. B. is executive director of a facility that works with males who are homeless, \nsuffer from mental health issues, in probation/parole, and/or struggle with drug addiction. \nHe has known Applicant for 30 years. They attended the same elementary school and \nhigh school. They know each other\u2019s families. At one point, they were married to two \nsisters until Applicant and his wife divorced. He is aware of many of the details of what \nApplicant went through during the divorce, but he and his spouse designated him to be \none of three individuals to manage their assets and care for their three daughters should \nsomething happen to them. They chose him because they wanted a person who would \ndo the right thing for their children. Applicant is honest, responsible and trustworthy. (AE \nA) \nThe pastor of Applicant\u2019s church has known Applicant since May 2021. He attends \nSunday services regularly. He participates in after service barbeques, and attends weekly \nBible study sessions on Wednesday evenings if his work schedule permits. He looks \nforward to his spiritual growth and further involvement in the congregation.

(AE \nB; AE J)  \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline I, Psychological Conditions \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair judgment, \nreliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is not required \nfor there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified mental health \nprofessional (e.g., clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) employed by, or \nacceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, should be consulted \nwhen evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under \nthis guideline and an opinion, including prognosis, should be sought. No \nnegative inference concerning the standards in this guideline may be raised \nsolely on the basis of mental health counseling. \nThe allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d are supported by the medical records and \nApplicant\u2019s testimony.  \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 28(a): behavior that casts doubt on an individual's judgment, stability, \nreliability, or trustworthiness, not covered under any other guideline and that \nmay indicate an emotional, mental, or personality condition, including, but \nnot limited to, irresponsible, violent, self-harm, suicidal, paranoid, \nmanipulative, impulsive, chronic lying, deceitful, exploitative, or bizarre \nbehaviors; \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 28(b): an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that \nthe individual has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, \nor trustworthiness: and \nAG \u00b6 28(c): voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization. \nAG \u00b6 28(a) applies because of Applicant\u2019s two suicide attempts and suicidal \nideations in 2017. \nAG \u00b6 28(b) is established by the psychologist\u2019s report requested by DOD CAF, \nwhich is specifically alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. \nAG \u00b6 28(c) is established because of Applicants two voluntary inpatient \nhospitalizations in September 2017 and December 2017. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 29(a): the identified condition is readily controllable with treatment, \nand the individual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance \nwith the treatment plan; \nAG \u00b6 29(b): the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is \ncurrently receiving counseling or treatment with a favorable prognosis by a \nduly qualified mental health professional; \nAG \u00b6 29(c): recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that \nan individual's previous condition is under control or in remission, and has \na low probability of recurrence or exacerbation:: \nAG \u00b6 29(d): the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows indications \nof emotional instability; and \nAG \u00b6 29(e): there is no indication of a current problem. \nAG \u00b6 29(a) applies.  Applicant sought out and was responsive to treatment for his \nmajor depressive disorder and suicidal ideations in 2017. He took medication and \nattended mostly weekly, but sometimes bi-weekly counseling sessions with a therapist \nfrom the VA. He implemented the suggested coping mechanisms from his therapist. He \ntook medication to deal with his depression and anxiety until he felt he no longer needed \nthem. He now exercises regularly; is involved in his church; plays on an adult baseball \nteam and is more engaged with others. He is doing well. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 29(b) applies. While Applicant stopped taking medication and attending \ncounseling in April 2019, he still followed the recommended actions that would help him \ncope and deal with stress.  In May 2023, Applicant began seeing a therapist on a weekly \nbasis to deal with some residual feelings related to his divorce; to learn how to cope and \nmanage current relationship challenges in his life; and to identify strategies to help \nthrough various life changes and transitions related to his upcoming move to another job \nlocated back in the United States. Mr. C. indicates Applicant has made moderate \nprogress. In August 2023, Dr. J.B.C., a licensed psychologist, diagnosed his condition as \nmajor depressive disorder, recurrent, in full remission. \nAG \u00b6 29(c) is established. Dr. M.L., the licensed clinical psychologist hired by the \nDOD, concluded that Applicant\u2019s condition was under control, but she could not give him \na favorable prognosis without Applicant attending therapy to help manage stressors in his \nenvironment. Applicant is now actively attending therapy. \nAG \u00b6 29(d) applies.  While Applicant is aware he will always need to take steps to \nmanage his depression, the primary factor contributing to his instability in 2017 was the \nbreakup of his marriage and subsequent divorce. He has been divorced for over five \nyears and no longer has contact with his wife. Throughout this process, he has been \nhonest about his mental health and interested in getting better. He attended counseling \nfor a period of two years and took anti-depressant and anti-anxiety medications until he \nno longer needed it. In 2021, he accepted a job overseas and has created a new life for \nhimself. He is stable and is active in his community. \nAG \u00b6 29(e) applies. Aside from the evidence presented by Applicant showing he \nhas taken steps to improve his outlook on life, he was recently evaluated by Dr. J.B.C, a \nlicensed psychologist, on August 28, 2023. After the evaluation, Dr. J.B.C. concluded that \nbased on past medical and current data, Applicant qualifies for a diagnosis of major \ndepressive order, recurrent, in full remission. He does not present any conditions at this \ntime that could pose a significant risk to his judgment, reliability or trustworthiness. Dr. \nJ.B.C. notes Applicant has gained a great deal of insight into what precipitates his \ndepressive episodes. He was actively attending psychotherapy and understood the \nimportance of therapy.  \nOver the past five years, Applicant has sought help for mental health issues. He \nfollowed the advice of his therapists on how to cope with future issues. He exercises on \na regular basis, attends church on a regular basis, plays on a baseball team, and recently \nentered into a new relationship. He has not encountered a major depressive episode or \nsuicidal ideation in over five years. There is no indication of a current problem. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline I in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered Applicant\u2019s honorable \nmilitary service, to include his deployment to Iraq. I considered the favorable testimonials \nfrom his current supervisor and his childhood friend. He was candid and sincere at the \nhearing. He demonstrated during his testimony that he is aware of his problems with \ndepression and has taken steps to cope with his depression and the daily issues and \nchallenges of life. \nWhile not alleged in the SOR, I considered the past counselings Applicant received \nwhile on active duty and while working in a previous job under the whole-person. I do not \nbelieve these past incidents have security significance. Applicant disclosed these \ncounselings during his security clearance background investigation. He learned from \nthem and has not had any on-the-job counselings since 2018. \nSince his divorce, Applicant has moved on and has taken steps to be more \ninvolved with others and is highly thought of by his current supervisor. He has done the \nwork to develop coping skills when he encounters situations that cause him anxiety. He \nhas not had a serious depressive episode since 2017. I have no questions about his \nreliability and trustworthiness. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline I and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the security concerns raised under Psychological Conditions. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I (Psychological Conditions):  FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nFor Applicant \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

In the same SCA, she \nalso disclosed the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, and 1.h, attributed them to \n\u201cfinancial difficulties,\u201d and stated that she had asked to settle them through an online \nservice. (FORM Item 1 at 35-37) \nIn her answer to DOHA interrogatories in March 2022, Applicant admitted the \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b-1.m, 1.p, and 1.r. For each debt, she admitted that the debt \nwas not paid, and no arrangements had been made to pay it.

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n01253 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).   \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence in the FORM establish two disqualifying \nconditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) \n(\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nNone of the above conditions are established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are \nrecent and numerous. She submitted no evidence showing that they were incurred \nunder unusual circumstances or circumstances largely beyond her control. She \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsubmitted no evidence of financial counseling, payments, or payment plans. She has \nnot disputed any of the debts alleged in the SOR. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested \na determination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate her \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \nBd. Jul. 23, 2003). After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by her delinquent \ndebts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.t: \nAgainst Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

On June \n29, 2023, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals issued a notice of video \nteleconference hearing, scheduling Applicant\u2019s case for July 18, 2023. The hearing was \nheld as scheduled. I received three Government exhibits (GE 1 \u2013 GE 3) and nineteen \nApplicant exhibits (AE A \u2013 AE T) and considered Applicant\u2019s testimony. The transcript (Tr.) \nwas received on August 3, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 56-year-old married man with four adult children. He and his wife have \nbeen married for 26 years. A previous marriage ended in divorce. Applicant has a high \nschool diploma and has taken some college courses. (AE G; Tr. 11) He is a veteran of both \nthe U.S. Navy and the U.S. Army. Applicant served in the Navy from 1987 to 1991. (AE B) \nHe was discharged honorably. In 1998, Applicant enlisted in the Army and served until \n2015, when he retired honorably. (AE A) While in the Army, he completed three tours of \nduty in combat zones. (Tr. 22) He has held a security clearance since 1988. (Tr. 21) \nThrough Applicant\u2019s Army career, he developed subject-matter expertise in the field \nof ordnance, storage, and security. (AE F at 3) Since February 2021, he has been working \nfor his current employer as a security officer. (GE 1 at 12) \nApplicant has a history of misconduct of a sexual nature. In 1999, he was cited for \nsolicitation of a prostitute. (Answer at 1) Applicant testified that he had no intention of \nsoliciting a prostitute that evening. Rather, while he was sitting at a traffic light on the way \nhome one evening in a part of town where prostitutes congregated, he saw a woman get \nout of a sports car. (AE T at 4) He suspected the woman was an undercover police officer \nbecause she was well dressed and looked \u201cmuch different than the other typical ladies of \nthe night would [look] in that area.\u201d He explained further that, because he was taking a \ncourse in criminology at the time, he wanted to speak to the supposed undercover officer to \nsee firsthand how undercover sting operations are conducted, in the event he ever needed \nto write a paper on the subject. (Tr. 26; GE 2 at 14) Subsequently, he asked the woman \nwhere she took her johns, and she nodded her head in the direction of a nearby hotel. (GE \n2 at 15) Applicant then drove his car towards the hotel and parked at an adjacent parking \nlot, whereupon multiple police officers pulled beside him in unmarked vehicles and issued \nhim a citation for soliciting prostitution. (Tr. 28) Subsequently, Applicant paid a fine. \nShortly after the episode, Applicant told his wife the same explanation of the \ncircumstances surrounding the issuance of the citation, to which he testified. She did not \nfind this explanation credible. (Tr. 48) \nBeginning in 2017, Applicant attended swingers\u2019 parties every four to five months. At \nthe hearing, he testified that he stopped attending them in 2020, whereas, during a subject \ninterview, he told the investigator that the last swingers\u2019 party he attended was in February \n2022, ten months after the initiation of the security clearance investigation. (GE 2 at 11) \nOften while at these parties, he had sexual intercourse with strangers.

When he went, he would tell her that he \nwas going to work. (Tr. 31) \nAt one of the parties, a woman with whom Applicant had sexual intercourse, \nphotographed him wearing no clothing except for a pair of panties. (AE T at 3) In March \n2021, while at work, Applicant checked his personal email and discovered that the woman \nhe met at the swingers\u2019 party emailed him the picture. (Tr. 15) Applicant tried to delete it, \nbut accidently saved it onto his office\u2019s work drive. (Tr. 15; GE 2 at 5) Because Applicant is \nnot computer literate, he was unable to delete it. Consequently, he asked a female \ncoworker for help. He did not ask a male coworker for help because he was too \nembarrassed. (GE 2 at 12) Before his coworker helped him, he warned her that she might \nfind the photograph offensive. (Tr. 15) She then went into the work drive and deleted the \npicture. (Tr. 16) \nShortly thereafter, the woman who helped Applicant delete the inappropriate picture \nfiled a sexual harassment complaint with their employer. The next day, Applicant\u2019s \nemployer fired him for violating company policy. (GE 2 at 6; GE 3) According to the \ntermination letter, Applicant\u2019s employer also reviewed the contents of Applicant\u2019s computer \nafter the coworker\u2019s complaint and discovered several \u201cobscene and offensive\u201d files. (GE 3) \nWhile on the job, Applicant watched pornography on his telework laptop \napproximately 15 to 20 times. (GE 2 at 6, 13; Tr. 38) He knew that it was against company \npolicy to download pornography onto his work computer, but he did not think that watching \npornography on his work computer while connected to his home internet carrier posed a \nproblem. (Tr. 17, 39) At the time Applicant was fired, he was the company\u2019s facility security \nofficer. (GE 1 at 13) \nApplicant has not watched pornography since May 2020, and he has not attended a \nswingers\u2019 party since February 2022. (Tr. 19, 35; GE 2 at 11) He is ashamed of the pain \nthat he caused his wife and understands that \u201clove is more powerful than any kind of \nfantasy.\u201d (Tr. 24) \nIn late 2022, Applicant told his wife about his swingers\u2019 party attendance. (AE F at 4; \nTr. 33) According to Applicant\u2019s wife, he feels shame and remorse for his behavior, has \ngrown as a person, \u201cand is working hard to develop the skills needed to avoid making such \npoor choices again.\u201d (AE F at 4) Moreover, he is a man of tremendous character who has \nsupported her through her fight with cancer, given a homeless man the shoes off his feet, \nand covered shifts for coworkers in crisis without advance notice. (AE F at 4) \nOne of Applicant\u2019s current supervisors provided a character reference.

(AE T at 6) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines are \nnot inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number \nof variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Executive \nOrder 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d).1 \nAnalysis \nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior \nThe security concerns about sexual behavior are set forth in AG \u00b6 18: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress . . . may raise questions about an individual\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. \nApplicant\u2019s attempt to solicit a prostitute in 1999, his participation in swingers\u2019 club \nparties without his wife\u2019s knowledge, and his perusal of pornography on his work laptop, \ntrigger the application of AG \u00b6 13(c), sexual behavior that causes an individual to be \nvulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress, and AG \u00b6 13(d), \u201csexual behavior . . . that \nreflects lack of discretion or judgment.\u201d \nThe potentially applicable mitigating guidelines set forth under AG \u00b6 14 are as \nfollows: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such \nunusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; and \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation or \nduress. \nApplicant attended swingers\u2019 club parties unbeknownst to his wife for nearly five \nyears, and he did not stop until several months after the completion of his security \nclearance application. Under these circumstances this behavior is too recent for AG \u00b614(b) \nto apply. \n1 The factors under AG \u00b6 2(a) are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the \nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the \nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct indirectly led to the loss of his job after another swinger emailed \nhim a compromising picture that Applicant inadvertently saved to his work drive and was \nunable to delete without the assistance of a coworker, who subsequently filed a sexual \nharassment complaint with their employer. Nevertheless, Applicant continued to attend \nthese parties for nearly a year after he was fired, and ten months after the initiation of the \nsecurity clearance investigation. Moreover, although Applicant told his wife about this \nbehavior, he did not do so until late 2022, nearly 18 months after he lost his job. \nConsequently, although Applicant\u2019s disclosure of this behavior constitutes a step in the right \ndirection to reduce vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, it is insufficient to \nconclude that this risk has been completely eliminated. I conclude that AG \u00b6 14(c) does not \napply. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, \ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.\u201d (AG \u00b6 15) \nIn addition to generating disqualifying conditions under the sexual conduct guideline, \nas discussed above, Applicant\u2019s misconduct, which ultimately contributed to him losing his \njob, triggers the application of AG \u00b6 16(e)(1), \u201cengaging in activities which, if known, could \naffect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing.\u201d Applicant\u2019s use of his \ntelework laptop, in addition to being inappropriate, was a significant misuse of his \nemployer\u2019s time and resources. AG \u00b6 16(d)(4), \u201cevidence of significant misuse of . . . \nemployer\u2019s time or resources,\u201d applies \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are potentially applicable: \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or \nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant told his wife about his sexual indiscretions and consulted with a \npsychologist, who ruled out sexual deviance as the cause of his behavior. Moreover, \nApplicant\u2019s testimony about the damage his behavior caused to his marriage and the pain it \ncaused his wife seemed contrite. In addition, one of Applicant\u2019s supervisor\u2019s is aware of his \npast misconduct. Consequently, AG \u00b6 17(e) applies. \nConversely, Applicant\u2019s testimony about his past sexual misconduct, including his \nexplanation of the circumstances surrounding his citation for soliciting prostitution, and his \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconflicting dates of when he stopped going to swingers\u2019 parties, was not credible. This lack \nof credibility undercuts the probative value of his reassurance that this conduct will not \nrecur. Therefore, AG \u00b6 17(d) only applies partially. \nGuideline M: Use of Information Technology \nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure to comply with rules, procedures, guidelines, or \nregulations pertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the willingness or ability \nto properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 39) Applicant\u2019s use \nof his telework laptop to view pornography triggers the application of AG \u00b6 40(e), \n\u201cunauthorized use of any information technology system.\u201d \nApplicant viewed pornography on his telework laptop recently. Consequently, AG \u00b6 \n41(a), \u201cso much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it happened under such \nunusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d is inapplicable. \nAG \u00b6 41(b) \u201cthe misuse was minor and done solely in the interest or organizational \nefficiency and effectiveness,\u201d and AG \u00b6 41(d), \u201cthe misuse was due to improper or \ninadequate training or unclear instructions,\u201d are not relevant. \nApplicant\u2019s viewing of pornography on his telework laptop was neither unintentional \nnor inadvertent. Moreover, his employer did not know about this conduct until a coworker \ninformed them about the inappropriate picture that Applicant asked her to help him delete. \nAG \u00b6 41(c), \u201cthe conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and followed by a prompt, good-\nfaith effort to correct the situation and by notification to appropriate personnel,\u201d is not \napplicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nWhile Applicant was at a swingers\u2019 club party, another club member took a \ncompromising position of him which she emailed to his personal drive. This ultimately led to \nhis dismissal from employment as Applicant attempted to delete the picture and \ninadvertently saved it to a work drive. As such, it epitomizes the type of unintended \nconsequence that can result from irresponsible, reckless behavior. \nAs recently as February 2022, ten months after Applicant completed his security \nclearance application, he was still attending swingers\u2019 parties without his wife\u2019s knowledge. \nConsequently, given the nature and seriousness of the conduct and its recency, it is too \nsoon to conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline M:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

His father was a railroad locomotive expert. \nHe came to the United States in 1952 as an employee of the Iranian Ministry of \nTransportation and Railroads to research ways to improve the Iranian railroad system. \nHe and his family returned to Iran because he was laid off at his job at a U.S. research \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfacility. Applicant\u2019s parents returned to live in the United States in 1978, one year before \nthe revolution in Iran. They lived in the U.S. the remainder of their lives. His three sisters \nalso continued their adult lives in the United States. (Tr. at 19-27.) \nApplicant has been married twice. In 1987, he married an Iranian-born woman, \nwho is a dual citizen of the United States and Iran. They divorced in 2018. They have two \nadult children. Applicant remarried another Iranian-born woman in 2019. She is a citizen \nof Iran and lives with Applicant in the United States. She is a U.S. lawful permanent \nresident (LPR). She intends to apply for U.S. citizenship when she has met the residency \nrequirement in 2024. Her father is deceased. At the time Applicant submitted the e-QIP, \nhis mother-in-law was alive, but she passed away in September 2022. His wife has three \nbrothers and a sister who are Iranian citizens and residents. Her family are part of a small, \nminority religious group in Iran. She speaks with her sister and one of her brothers by \nphone with some frequency. Applicant\u2019s wife works in the United States as a mathematics \nteacher at a private school. (Tr. at 33-39, 41-43; GE 1 at Sections 17, 18; AE A.) \nApplicant has travelled to Iran several times during his adult life, including a \nnumber of times after the Iranian Revolution. He traveled frequently to Iran to visit his \nfuture second wife before they married in 2019 and until she received her visa to enter \nthe United States as his wife in 2021. He uses his Iranian passport to enter Iran because \nthat is a requirement of the Iranian Government. Now that his mother-in-law has died, he \nno longer has any reason to return to Iran. If his wife returns to Iran to visit with her \nsiblings, Applicant claims that he has no reason to travel with her. Applicant\u2019s last trip to \nIran was in April 2021 to escort his second wife to the United States following her receipt \nof her LPR status. He did not travel to Iran to attend the funeral services for his mother-\nin-law in 2022. Applicant stated that, from his prior experience as a clearance holder, he \nunderstands the foreign travel procedures and the importance of compliance with those \nsecurity procedures in the event he travels anywhere outside the United States. (Tr. at \n29-33, 44-45, 55.) \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAt the hearing, Applicant responded to the following allegations in the SOR: \n1.a: Applicant\u2019s Wife. Applicant\u2019s wife is a citizen of Iran. As of 2021, she has \nrelocated to be with Applicant in the United States and is a lawful permanent resident in \nthe U.S. She intends to apply for U.S. citizenship when she Is eligible to do so in 2024. \n1.b: Applicant\u2019s Mother-in-Law.

Shia \nclergy and political leaders vetted by the clergy dominate key power structures in the \ncountry. Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader is the head of state and holds constitutional authority \nover the judiciary, government-run media, and other important institutions. \nThe U.S. Department of State advises U.S. citizens not to travel to Iran due to the \nrisk of kidnapping and the arbitrary arrest and detention of U.S. citizens. Since 1984, Iran \nhas been designated by the United States as a state sponsor of terrorism. Its support of \nterrorist organizations throughout the Middle East creates instability in the region. Iran \nthreatens U.S. persons directly and through proxy attacks, particularly in the Middle East. \nIran\u2019s growing expertise and willingness to conduct aggressive cyber operations \nmake it a major threat to U.S. and allied networks and data. As of 2018, all previously \nsuspended sanctions imposed on Iran were reinstated with the goals of permanently \npreventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon, ceasing Iran\u2019s development of ballistic \nmissiles, and ending Iran\u2019s broad range of malign activities. \nThe U.S. Department of State has identified significant human rights issues in Iran. \nThe issues include the unlawful and arbitrary killings by the Iranian Government or its \nagents; forced disappearances attributed to the government; torture and inhumane \ntreatment by the government and its agents; the imprisonment of political opponents; \nsevere restrictions on free expression and the media; serious restrictions on political \nparticipation; and government corruption. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in AG \n\u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nGuideline B sets forth nine conditions in AG \u00b6 7 that could raise security concerns \nand may be disqualifying in this case. The following three conditions are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;  \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship \nstatus, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, \nmanipulation, pressure, or coercion.  \nI note that the mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign \ncountry is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one \nrelative is a citizen of a foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, \nthis factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could \npotentially result in the compromise of classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, \n2001). \nThe evidence is sufficient to establish the above potentially disqualifying conditions \nand shifts the burden to Applicant to mitigate the security concerns. AG \u00b6 8 provides six \nconditions that could mitigate security concerns under Guideline B. The following two \nconditions have possible application in this case: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \nand \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \nBoth of the above mitigating conditions apply in this case. The nature of Applicant\u2019s \nrelationship with his wife, who legally resides with him in the United States, renders it \nunlikely that he will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of \nhis wife or the Iranian Government and the interests of the United States. Moreover, there \nis no conflict of interest because Applicant\u2019s sense of loyalty to the Iranian Government \nand country is so minimal and because he has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the United States that he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest \nin favor of the U.S. interest. Based upon an overall view of the facts of this case and the \nmitigating conditions, Applicant has established mitigation of security concerns under \nGuideline B. SOR paragraph 1 is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s potential for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has provided evidence \nof his strong ties to the United States, starting with his U.S. birth and citizenship. His \nmarriage to an Iranian citizen raises concerns about the potential for foreign influence, \nbut that concern has been mitigated by his wife\u2019s relocation to the United States and her \ncurrent status as an LPR. As noted, the recent death of his mother-in-law has eliminated \nthe security concerns raised by her Iranian citizenship and residency. Although the \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGovernment has not alleged any security concerns due to the presence of Applicant\u2019s \nbrothers-in-law and sister-in-law in Iran, I have weighed the concerns such contacts could \nraise and have concluded that they do not present a potential for a conflict of interest \nunder the facts of this case. Applicant\u2019s nearly lifelong presence in the United States \nmitigates the potential for a conflict of interest due to his wife\u2019s relationships with her \nsiblings in Iran. I have also weighed the risks presented by Applicant\u2019s past travel to Iran. \nI view his testimony as highly credible that he has no reason to continue to travel to Iran \nin the future. Overall, the record evidence does not create any questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s present suitability for national security eligibility. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nJOHN BAYARD GLENDON \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

Applicant planned to \ncall a witness to testify, but the witness was unable to join the hearing. I held the record \nopen for two weeks in the event either party wanted to supplement the record with \nadditional documentation. Applicant timely provided two personal statements, (Applicant \nExhibit (AE) E and F), which were admitted without objection. On May 24, 2023, I received \nthe hearing transcript. After the hearing, Applicant\u2019s witness did not want to get involved \nin this hearing and would not provide any information or a written statement for the \nApplicant. Applicant tried to submit a text and recorded message from the reluctant \nwitness as evidence, but I would not admit this information into the record. The record \nclosed on June 1, 2023. (e-mail communications) \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, she denied all five of the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e. \nDepartment Counsel submitted three credit reports which support the SOR financial \nallegations. (GE 3, GE 4, GE 5) \nApplicant is 53 years old. In June 1998, she immigrated to the United States from \nLiberia. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in November 2003. In 2005, Applicant \nmarried and divorced in 2010. She married a second time in 2014, and she became \nwidowed in 2018. She has a daughter, age 27, and three minor children between the \nages of 17 and 13. She received her cosmetology license for management and business \nin May 2012. In 2022, she earned an associate degree in cybersecurity. (Tr. 87-92; GE \n1; AE F) \nApplicant has been employed as a protective agent for a government contractor \nsince November 2020. She was issued an interim security clearance, but she lost her job \nin September 2022 after her interim security clearance was revoked with the issuance of \nthe SOR. She earned over $28 an hour for this position. She recently started employment \nas a certified nursing assistant earning $20 an hour. Applicant would like to receive her \nDOD security clearance so that she can resume her employment with the government \ncontractor. (Tr. 87-92, 103; GE 1; AE F) \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant created significant debt due, in part, to her ignorance of business and \nfinancial practices. She does not believe she is responsible for the SOR debts because \nof her lack of knowledge, and her claim that these creditors took advantage of her and \nwere dishonest in their business transactions. Her financial problems worsened after she \nlost her employment in about September 2022. (Tr. 95-102; SOR response) \nThe SOR alleges five delinquent debts totaling approximately $40,335.

In the SOR \nresponse, Applicant stated that she does not owe any money to this insurance creditor, \nand that these are false allegations. During the hearing, she testified that she had opened \nan account with this creditor, and they sent her a piece of equipment to install in her son\u2019s \ncar. She was unable to install the equipment. She thought the account for $118 was for \nthe equipment she returned to the insurance company, although the return was admittedly \nlate. She provided photos of the equipment and the mail receipt for the returned \nequipment. She also provided a screen shot from the creditor acknowledging the \nequipment was received. Applicant said the information from the insurance company was \nconfusing. She called them multiple times to have them explain why she owed any money, \nbut the insurance creditor could not provide any information. She has not paid any money \nto either of these delinquent accounts. (Tr. 25-42, GE 2, GE 3, GE 4, GE 5, AE B) \nThe credit reports in the record show that SOR \u00b6 1.a is a duplicate account for \nSOR \u00b6 1.e since they have the same account numbers. Based on the most recent credit \nreport, the insurance account has an outstanding balance of $35. Applicant has \nreasonably disputed this $35 debt. (Tr. 25-42, GE 2, GE 3, GE 4, GE 5, AE B) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges a charged-off car loan account in the amount of $10,208. The \nFebruary 2023 credit report showed that the account was opened in February 2019, and \nApril 2020 was the date of \u201cmajor first delinquency reported.\u201d Applicant denied this debt \nin her SOR response and claimed it was a false allegation. She provided a September \n2021 statement that she received pre-approval from the car loan creditor for financing. \nShe initially wanted to purchase a Lexus when she went to the dealership, but she ended \nup buying a Mitsubishi instead. She testified that she had been at the dealership all day \nand signed the paperwork to purchase the Mitsubishi car. She was unhappy with this \nvehicle and called the car-loan creditor. She was advised to return the car back to the \ndealership if she did not like it. It is unclear how long she had possession of the car, but \nat the minimum, she had the car for a week. On July 12, 2019, she called the dealership \nand reported the conversation she had with the car loan creditor. The next day she \nvoluntarily returned the car to the dealership. She reported this information to the car loan \ncreditor, who in turn told her that she had nothing to worry about and that she did not owe \nany money for the returned Mitsubishi car. The February 2023 credit report showed that \nApplicant had disputed this account with the car loan creditor, but after information was \nprovided to the credit agency, the account was taken out of dispute status. Applicant did \nnot provide supporting documentation to show that she is not liable for this delinquent \naccount. For example, she did not provide correspondence sent to the creditor or credit \nreporting company explaining why she believed she was not responsible for this debt. \nThis debt remains unresolved. (SOR response, Tr. 49-66, 93-97; GE 2 page 5, GE 3, GE \n5; AE E) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges a car loan creditor account for a repossessed car with an \noutstanding deficiency balance of $29,692. In May 2019, Applicant stated that she had \npurchased a Ford vehicle, but due to the pandemic, she lost her employment in March \n2020.

(Tr. 66-\n80, 95; SOR response, GE 2, GE 5; AE E) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges a delinquent account with a bottled water supplier that was \nreferred for collection in the amount of $232. During the hearing, Applicant stated that this \naccount was opened in about July 2020 at a retail store for a water bottle delivery service \nfor her residential water cooler. After four bottles of water were delivered, she called the \nwater supplier and told them that her equipment was incompatible and their water bottles \nwould not work with her cooler. The water supplier told her to leave the bottled water \noutside of her residence and they would pick it up. They automatically charged her credit \ncard approximately $150 for this service. She did not understand why the water supplier \naccount showed an outstanding balance of $232. She had called the creditor on several \noccasions, but no one was able to respond to her questions. Applicant\u2019s supporting \ndocumentation submitted to demonstrate that she is not responsible for the unpaid $232 \ndebt was insufficient and unpersuasive. For example, she did not provide correspondence \nsent to the creditor or credit reporting company explaining why she believed she was not \nresponsible for this debt. This debt remains unresolved. (SOR response, Tr. 42-49, 92; \nGE 3) \nDuring the hearing Applicant discussed delinquent accounts that were listed on \nher February 2023 credit report. These delinquent accounts were not included in the \nSOR. She did not know why her credit report showed a delinquent account with an \ninsurance creditor in the amount of $167, but she did admit that she had business \ndealings with this company. She also had two delinquent credit card accounts totaling \n$303. In July 2022, she had another credit card account that was charged off in the \namount of $665. She stated that she is aware of these credit card accounts and has \ncontacted the creditors about her employment and financial issues. She stated that some \nof the SOR debts she was unaware of until she received the SOR in September 2022. \nShe admitted that she was aware of the two largest SOR debts when she completed her \ninterrogatory in September 2021.

Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility.  \nAG \u00b6 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, \n2010), the Appeal Board explained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \nThe credit reports in evidence reflect five delinquent debts and Applicant\u2019s \nresponsibility for the debts she denied. The record establishes the disqualifying conditions \nin AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), and 19(c) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of \nmitigating conditions. \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago,  was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. Applicant admitted a certain amount of \nfinancial ignorance, which caused her to develop two significant SOR debts from the \npurchase and return of two vehicles. Her loss of her employment in September 2022 also \ncontributed to her financial problems. Applicant signed contracts with different \nbusinesses, but she failed to comply with the terms of these contracts. She became aware \nof her two largest debts in at least September 2021, a full year before she lost her \ngovernment contractor employment. At the time of the hearing, she still had not taken any \naction beyond telephone calls to the creditors to resolve her delinquent accounts. She \nclaimed that she is not responsible for these SOR debts due to her lack of business \nknowledge and the deceptive business practices of her creditors. A degree of ignorance \nto one's financial situation may suggest an indifference to the proper satisfaction of legal \nobligations. After September 2021, her knowledge about the two largest debts at issue \ncan no longer be attributed to unawareness, but rather a lack of due diligence. Her failure \nto take more aggressive actions to resolve her legal obligations creates a security concern \nabout her reliability and her willingness to follow laws, rules, and regulations. \nThere are circumstances beyond an individual\u2019s control that can adversely affect \ntheir personal finances. However, to receive full credit for this mitigating condition, an \napplicant must show that he or she acted responsibly under the circumstances. In this \ninstance, Applicant failed to demonstrate that she acted responsibly since she did not \ntake more aggressive actions to document the disputes of her delinquent debts.

Under all of these \ncircumstances, Applicant failed to establish that financial considerations security \nconcerns are mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant developed delinquent debt before she lost employment in September \n2022, and there is no track record of steady, systematic payments over an extended \nperiod of time. She has not taken responsibility for the debts she created, and if she did \nnot fully understand the significance of signing a legally binding business contract, then \nshe should have sought advice from a family member, friend, or attorney. Her inability to \nfully understand business transactions is not a valid excuse. She did not show that the \npurchase of the two vehicles involved complicated contracts or payment plans. Her \nactions demonstrate a lack of financial responsibility and good judgment, and raise \nunmitigated questions about her reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation. \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more effort toward documented resolution of her past-due debt, and a track record \nof behavior consistent with her obligations, she may well be able to demonstrate \npersuasive evidence of her security clearance worthiness. \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec.

His admission is incorporated into \nthe findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence \nsubmitted, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 26 years old. He has never married and has no children. After \ngraduating high school in 2014, he earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2018. He began \nworking as an engineer with a defense contractor in May 2019.

Applicant lives in State 1. He smoked marijuana in a neighboring \nstate, State 2, where its purchase and use was legal under state law. After a few weeks, \nhe stopped using marijuana when he began feeling \u201cparanoid\u201d each time he smoked. \nAbout a year later, marijuana became legal in State 1 and Applicant started smoking \nmarijuana weekly. (Items 4, 6) \nIn August 2021, Applicant briefly stopped using marijuana so that he could \ninterview and take a drug test for his current employer in connection with the hiring \nprocess. Once Applicant passed the drug test, he resumed his use of marijuana. (Item \n4) \nOn his October 2021 SCA, Applicant disclosed that all of his marijuana use \noccurred while he possessed a security clearance. He further stated \u201cI intend to use this \ndrug since it\u2019s legal in [State 1], although I will not if it is necessary to stop for this \nsecurity clearance, or for my job.\u201d (Item 4) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDuring his January 2022 background interview, Applicant explained he smoked \nmarijuana with his former girlfriend and her cousin. He described feeling a \u201cparanoid \nanxiety\u201d each time he smoked and stopped using it. However, he started using \nmarijuana again when it became available in State 1. Applicant admitted that, during \nthis time, he held a security clearance with his previous employer, a defense contractor. \nHowever, Applicant claimed that the contractor had a \u201claid-back environment\u201d and he \ndid not recall ever being briefed about drug use or being required to take a urinalysis. \n(Item 5) \nHowever, Applicant stated that shortly after starting with his current employer, \nthat employer\u2019s security officer told him that he could not use marijuana while holding a \nsecurity clearance. Applicant claimed that he was \u201csurprised\u201d to learn that marijuana \nremained illegal under federal law, which, in his view, \u201ccontradicted\u201d state law. He \nclaimed that he never used marijuana in high school or college because it was illegal \nand he had since only used in states where it was legal. Applicant asserted he would \nnot have used marijuana if it was illegal for him to do so. He claimed that he had no \nintent of using marijuana in the future. (Item 5) \nIn his June 2022 Response to DOHA Interrogatories, Applicant detailed that he \nused marijuana weekly from April 2020 through May 2020 and again from May 2021 \nthrough August 2021. After he passed his August 2021 drug test, Applicant increased \nhis marijuana use to every other day until he stopped in October 2021. (Item 5) \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant stated \u201cI used marijuana in places it was \nlegalized \u2026 and didn\u2019t realize I was breaking this guideline since it was only illegal at \nthe federal level. I have stopped using marijuana since my security officer warned me \nabout this guideline and I don\u2019t plan on using it in the future.\u201d (Item 3) \nApplicant did not respond to the Government\u2019s FORM or otherwise offer any \nmitigating evidence beyond what he had previously stated. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern regarding drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription drugs, and the use of other substances that can cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with \ntheir intended use can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a \nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nControlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 \nU.S.C 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline \nto describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 \n25 and the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThe Controlled Substances Act (\u201cCSA\u201d) makes it illegal under Federal law to \nmanufacture, possess, or distribute certain drugs, including marijuana. (Controlled \nSubstances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801, et seq. See \u00a7 844). All controlled substances are \nclassified into five schedules, based on their accepted medical uses, their potential for \nabuse, and their psychological and physical effects on the body. \u00a7\u00a7811, 812. Marijuana \nis classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, \u00a7812(c), based on its high potential \nfor abuse, no accepted medical use, and no accepted safety for use in medically \nsupervised treatment. \u00a7812(b)(1). See Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1 (2005). \nIn October 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued a \nmemorandum entitled \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use,\u201d (2014 \nDNI Memo) which makes clear that changes in the laws pertaining to marijuana by the \nvarious states, territories, and the District of Columbia do not alter the existing National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines, and that Federal law supersedes state laws on this \nissue: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines. . . . An individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the \nuse, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations. As always, adjudicative authorities are \nexpected to evaluate claimed or developed use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. The adjudicative authority \nmust determine if the use of, or involvement with, marijuana raises \nquestions about the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nwillingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, including federal \nlaws, when making eligibility decisions of persons proposed for, or \noccupying, sensitive national security positions. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board, which I am required to follow, has cited the 2014 DNI \nMemo in holding that \u201cstate laws allowing for the legal use of marijuana in some limited \ncircumstances do not pre-empt provisions of the Industrial Security Program, and the \nDepartment of Defense is not bound by the status of an applicant\u2019s conduct under state \nlaw when adjudicating that individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 14-03734 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2016). The current National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines went into effect on June 8, 2017, after the 2014 DNI memo was \nissued. Nevertheless, the principle continues to apply.  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMoreover, on December 21, 2021, DNI Avril D. Haynes issued a memorandum \nentitled, \u201cSecurity Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for \nAgencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position.\u201d (2021 DNI Memo) The \nmemo incorporates the AGs (at reference B) and the 2014 DNI Memo (at reference G) \namong various other relevant federal laws, executive orders, and memoranda. I take \nadministrative notice of the 2021 DNI memo here, given its relevance to this case, its \nreliance on the AGs, and its recency. \nThe 2021 DNI memo specifically notes that \u201cunder policy set forth in SEAD 4's \nadjudicative guidelines, the illegal use or misuse of controlled substances can raise \nsecurity concerns about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness to access \nclassified information or to hold a sensitive position, as well as their ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d (citing Guideline H, alleged in this case, \nand the AGs for personal conduct and criminal conduct, Guidelines E and J, not alleged \nin this case). Thus, consistent with these references, the AGs indicate that \u201cdisregard of \nfederal law pertaining to marijuana remains relevant, but not determinative, to \nadjudications of eligibility for access to classified information or eligibility to hold a \nsensitive position.\u201d (2021 DNI Memo) \nApplicant submitted his first SCA in 2019, and his clearance was subsequently \ngranted. He began using marijuana on a weekly basis from April 2020 through May \n2020 and again from May 2021 through August 2021. After he passed his August 2021 \ndrug test, he used marijuana every other day until October 2021, when he submitted his \nmost recent SCA. By his own admission, his marijuana use occurred either while \ngranted access to classified information or while holding a sensitive position. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n25(a) and 25(f) both apply. \nThe adjudicative guideline includes two conditions in AG \u00b6 26 that could mitigate \nthe security concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s drug use: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant\u2019s marijuana use was both \nrecent and frequent. He initially used marijuana in April and May 2020, but stopped \nwhen it made him feel paranoid. However, a year later he resumed using marijuana \nweekly. This use occurred while he was granted access to classified information. \nAn applicant's use of illegal drugs after having completed a security clearance \napplication or after otherwise having been placed on notice of the incompatibility of drug \nabuse and clearance eligibility raises questions about his or her judgment, reliability, \nand willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n17-04198 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2019). It has long been held that ignorance or mistake \nof law is generally not an excuse for failing to abide by legal obligations. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 19-00540 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2019). \nThere is no evidence in the record that Applicant ever sought clarification from \nhis first employer regarding the company\u2019s drug policies or the potential ramifications of \nhis marijuana use while holding a security clearance. Instead, in August 2021, he \nstopped using marijuana just long enough to pass a drug test for his current employer. \nThis circumstance strongly suggests that, in doing so, Applicant had at least a minimal \nunderstanding that ongoing drug use could negatively affect his employment. Yet, he \nresumed using marijuana anyway and at a greater frequency. Applicant\u2019s continued use \nof marijuana, even after the drug test, leaves me with concerns regarding his ability to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nApplicant disclosed his past drug involvement and stated he no longer intends on \nusing marijuana. These are steps to be considered in weighing mitigation. However, \nparticularly given that he used marijuana after filling out an SCA and after being drug \ntested, I find that insufficient time has passed to show that his security significant \nconduct is behind him. The circumstances and extent of Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use \npreclude full application of either AG \u00b6 26(a) or AG \u00b6 26(b). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant did not request a hearing, nor did he respond to the FORM. In so \ndoing, he did not provide any additional evidence in explanation or mitigation beyond his \nanswer, and I had no opportunity to evaluate his credibility and sincerity based on \ndemeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). Overall, the \nfrequency, recency and seriousness of Applicant\u2019s conduct leaves me with questions \nand doubts as to his suitability for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

The report reflects that BI asked if Applicant\u2019s negative response meant \nthat it was just Applicant and his sister, and Applicant responded in the affirmative. The \nreport reflects that after BI verified information about Applicant\u2019s listed foreign contact, \nwhich was his then-spouse, BI asked Applicant if he had any other foreign contacts and \nApplicant disclosed his brother in Ethiopia. He then disclosed information about his \nbrother and his brother\u2019s family in Ethiopia during the remainder of that background \ninterview. He continued to disclose such information during four subsequent interviews \nin October 2020 and November 2020, as well as in his response to interrogatories, \nAnswer, and FORM Response. (Items 1-3; Form Response) \nApplicant maintained that he did not intentionally falsify his SCA or his October \n20, 2020, background interview by failing to disclose information about his brother in \nEthiopia. He indicated that he did not list his brother on his SCA because he found the \nSCA confusing, as he did not understand what foreign contacts meant, and he was \nfocused on disclosing his family in the United States. He also indicated that he was \nunder time restraints, and he did not have his brother\u2019s contact information. He stated \nthat his omission was a misunderstanding. (Items 1-3; Form Response) \nEthiopia \nEthiopia\u2019s constitution provides for an ethnic-based federal system of \ngovernment.

The elections took place against a backdrop of grave instability, including inter-\nethnic and inter-communal violence and an electoral process that was not free or fair \nfor all citizens, although observers assessed the result generally reflected the will of \nmost citizens. \nThe U.S. Department of State travel advisory for Ethiopia is at \u201cLevel 3: \nReconsider Travel,\u201d due to armed conflict, civil unrest, communications disruptions, \ncrime, and the potential for terrorism and kidnapping in border areas. It advises against \ntravel to the Tigray region and border with Eritrea due to armed conflict; the Amhara \nRegion due to armed conflict and civil unrest; the Afar Region due to armed conflict \nand civil unrest; the border area with Somalia due to potential for terrorism, kidnapping, \nand landmines; border areas with Sudan and South Sudan due to crime, kidnapping, \ncivil unrest, and ongoing clashes between various armed groups; border areas with \nKenya due to potential for terrorism and ethnically motivated violence; and the Wollega \nZones of the Oromia Region due to violence and civil unrest.

In late 2020, Ethiopian \nsecurity officials announced the arrest of AS and ISIS members accused of planning \nattacks in Addis Ababa and other parts of Ethiopia. Terrorist organizations continue to \nplan terrorist attacks against U.S. citizens, Western targets, and interests in East \nAfrica. \nThe U.S. Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) noted that the \nconflict in Ethiopia\u2019s Tigray region since November 2020 has worsened humanitarian \nconditions and resulted in at least 2.1 million internally displaced persons. The ongoing \nconflict has also led to refugees fleeing to neighboring countries, which could \ndestabilize the region resulting in additional migrants seeking travel to Europe. The \nODNI assessed that in 2022, East Africa will see new bouts of conflict in the coming \nyear as the region becomes increasingly strained by the civil war in Ethiopia and other \nregional conflicts. \nThe U.S. Department of State reported that the most significant human rights \nissues in Ethiopia included: unlawful or arbitrary killings, including extrajudicial killings \nby the government; forced disappearance by the government; torture and cases of \ncruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by the government; harsh and \nlife-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary arrest and detention; political prisoners or \ndetainees; serious abuses in a conflict, including reportedly unlawful or widespread \ncivilian harm, enforced disappearances or abductions, torture and physical abuses or \npunishments; reports of unlawful recruitment or use of child soldiers by militia groups; \nserious restrictions on free expression and media, including violence or threats of \nviolence against journalists, unjustified arrests of journalists, censorship, and the \nexistence of criminal libel and slander laws; serious restrictions on internet freedoms; \nsubstantial interference with the freedom of peaceful assembly; serious government \ncorruption; lack of investigation and accountability for gender-based violence; \ntrafficking in persons; crimes involving violence or threats of violence targeting \nmembers of racial or ethnic minority groups; and the existence or use of laws \ncriminalizing same-sex sexual conduct. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline B: Foreign Influence \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, \nand its human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s \nfamily members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, or the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the \nUnited States. In considering the nature of the government, an administrative judge \nmust also consider any terrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR \nCase No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006) (reversing decision to grant \nclearance where administrative judge did not consider terrorist activity in area where \nfamily members resided). \nAG \u00b6 7(a) requires substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \u201cheightened \nrisk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low standard. \n\u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \nmember living under a foreign government. Applicant\u2019s brother and sister-in-law are \nEthiopian citizens residing in Ethiopia. The U.S. Department of State travel advisory for \nEthiopia is at \u201cLevel 3: Reconsider Travel,\u201d due to armed conflict, civil unrest, \ncommunications disruptions, crime, and the potential for terrorism and kidnapping in \nborder areas. Applicant has weekly contact with his brother in Ethiopia, and Applicant \nsaw his brother and his brother\u2019s family when he traveled to Ethiopia in 2015, 2017, and \n2018. His family in Ethiopia creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) have been \nraised by the evidence. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 8.

Although Applicant has not traveled to Ethiopia since 2018, he \nmaintains weekly contact with his brother and his brother\u2019s family there. AG \u00b6 8(c) is not \nestablished. Applicant complied with reporting requirements, to include reporting his \nbrother during his background interviews, response to interrogatories, Answer, and \nFORM Response. AG \u00b6 8(e) applies. \nApplicant has lived in the United States since 2008. He is a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen and holds a U.S. passport, which he used to travel to Ethiopia during his trips \nthere. His girlfriend since 2015, whom he intends to marry, is also a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen, and she is the mother of their three children. He provides her with financial \nsupport of $1,000 monthly. He lives with his sister and her spouse, and he contributes to \ntheir rent. He has worked as a part-time bus driver for county public schools and as a \nbus driver for his employer since 2018. He also volunteers as a priest for his church. \nApplicant met his burden to demonstrate that he would resolve any conflict of interest in \nfavor of the U.S. interest. AG \u00b6 8(b) is established. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct  \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \n7 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying.

He continued to disclose such information in \nsubsequent interviews, in his response to interrogatories, his Answer, and his FORM \nResponse. He explained that he found the SCA confusing, and he was focused on \ndisclosing his family in the United States. He maintained that he did not intentionally \nfalsify his SCA or information during his background interview, and that the omission of \nhis brother in Ethiopia was a misunderstanding. I find that he did not deliberately falsify \nhis response to section 18 of his SCA, and he did not deliberately falsify information \nduring his October 20, 2022, interview. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) and 16(b) are not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

On \nJuly 5, 2022, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) sent \nhim a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F.

Items 3 through \n7 are admitted into evidence. The case was assigned to me on January 26, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 33, is divorced with three children, ages 11, 9, and 5. He was \nmarried from March 2011 through January 2012. His youngest child resides with him. His \neldest child resides at another address in his home state. His middle child, with a different \nlast name, resides in another state. He received his high school diploma in May 2008. He \nearned a technical degree in February 2018. He has been employed as a mechanic by a \ndefense contractor since May 2021. He previously worked for the same employer from \nNovember 2008 through May 2010. In October 2012, he was honorably discharged from \nthe U.S. Air Force. He reported active-duty service dates from May 2012 through October \n2013. He was previously granted DOD security clearances in 2009 and 2012. (Item 3) \nThe SOR alleged 14 debts derived from Applicant\u2019s June 2021 and May 2022 \ncredit bureau reports (CBRs). Without explanation, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nthrough 1.c, 1.e through 1.i, and 1.l, totaling $26,732; and denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.j, 1.k, \n1.m, and 1.n, totaling $9,498. An October 2022 credit report revealed that Applicant \nopened six new credit accounts between May 2020 and June 2022, one of which was in \na charged-off status. (Items 4-6) \nThe record did not indicate the reason why Applicant responded \u201cno\u201d to each \nquestion about his financial record and did not otherwise disclose any delinquent debts \nin his SCA. In April 2022, Applicant responded to interrogatories propounded by the CAF \nabout his finances. He was asked specific questions about SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.j \nthrough 1.n. He disclosed SOR \u00b6 1.b in response to a question asking him if he had any \nother delinquent accounts. He explained, \u201cI finally have a steady job and getting caught \nup it is just taking longer than planned but I am starting to pay stuff down or off.\u201d (Item 3, \n7) \nIn his interrogatory responses, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d to whether he had paid \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.e, 1.g, 1.h, and 1.j through 1.n. He acknowledged SOR \u00b6 1.b as an \nequipment return charge. He attributed SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e. and 1.n to a third party for which he \nhad cosigned the accounts and asserted that he was \u201ctrying to communicate with the \nother party to get it figured out.\u201d He attributed SOR \u00b6 1.g to missing a payment and then \nforgetting about it. He attributed SOR \u00b6 1.h to being unable to afford the monthly payment \nand asserted that he made payment arrangements to resolve it. He maintained that he \nwas not aware of the medical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j, 1.k, and 1.m. Without proffering any \ncorroborating documents, he asserted that he was trying to settle SOR \u00b6 1.b and that \nnone of the medical debts appeared on a credit report he reviewed. He provided a \ndocument confirming that he negotiated a settlement agreement on March 7, 2022, to \nrepay $3,551 to resolve SOR \u00b6 1.h via 24 monthly payments of $148, beginning April 1, \n2022.

The pay stub showed that he worked the following year-to-date \novertime hours: 57.90 time-and-a-half hours, 94.90 double-time hours, and 8.10 triple-\ntime hours. He also received a $1,500 award at some point. On his PFS, he reported a \nnet remainder of $291 and listed two monthly debt payments, a $868 auto loan, in current \nstatus, and $147 for SOR \u00b6 1.h. (Item 7 at 9) \nApplicant reported four periods of unemployment on his SCA. He was unemployed \nfrom February through May 2012 after he left his retail job to enlist in the Air Force. He \nwas unemployed from April through August 2014 following his relocation from State A to \nState B. He was unemployed from January 2015 through June 2016 while he attended \nschool. He was unemployed from February through June 2017 after he left his job to focus \non school because his grades had been slipping. (Item 3) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case \nNo. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012)) \nThe record evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts) and AG \n\u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI considered each of the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the concern \nunder this guideline and find the following relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant did not meet his burden to establish that his debts were largely \nattributable to his periods of unemployment or other circumstances beyond his control.  \nHe also failed to proffer evidence sufficient to demonstrate that he acted responsibly to \naddress his debts or to establish any of the mitigating conditions in AG \u00b6 20(a), (b), (d), \nor (e). He did not proffer a basis to support his denial of SOR \u00b6 1.n. He did not substantiate \nhis dispute of the medical debts in \u00b6 1.d, 1.j, 1.k, and 1.m or provide other evidence that \nhe has taken action to resolve the issue. He is credited with negotiating a payment \narrangement to resolve SOR \u00b6 1.h and working overtime hours. However, he did not \ncorroborate any payments he made or otherwise demonstrate meaningful progress in \nresolving his debts. He opened six new credit accounts between May 2020 and June \n2022, one of which is in delinquent status. I am unable to conclude that his finances are \nunder control and unlikely to recur. Accordingly, I have doubts about his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised \nthe debts alleged in the SOR. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of \nshowing that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant him \neligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.n: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 41-year-old employee of a government contractor for whom he has worked since July 2021. He has been married and divorced twice. His first marriage was from 2005 until 2009. His second marriage was from 2014 until 2021. He resides with a cohabitant. He does not have any children. He obtained a graduate equivalency degree (GED), and he has taken many college courses but has not earned an undergraduate degree. He earned a certificate as a master educator in 2019. He served on active duty with the Army from 1999 until 2021, when he retired with an honorable discharge. He was assigned to multiple overseas deployments while he served.

He has been married and divorced twice. His first marriage \nwas from 2005 until 2009. His second marriage was from 2014 until 2021. He resides \nwith a cohabitant. He does not have any children. He obtained a graduate equivalency \ndegree (GED), and he has taken many college courses but has not earned an \nundergraduate degree. He earned a certificate as a master educator in 2019. He served \non active duty with the Army from 1999 until 2021, when he retired with an honorable \ndischarge. He was assigned to multiple overseas deployments while he served. The \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs (VA) has rated him as a 100 percent disabled veteran. \n(Tr. 26-27, 32-39, 50, 55-58; Answer; GE 1, 3) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s five delinquent debts totaling \napproximately $49,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e). He admitted all the Guideline F SOR \nallegations with additional commentary. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. \nThe Guideline F SOR allegations are established by his admissions and the \nGovernment\u2019s 2021, 2022, and 2023 credit reports. (Tr. 42-78, 165-174; Answer; GE 1, \n3-6, 10, 11; AE A) \nThe Guideline F SOR debts are being resolved. These debts consist of credit \ncards, a personal loan, and a line of credit. He became delinquent on these accounts \nbecause his first wife took advantage of his granting her a power of attorney while he \nwas deployed, his divorces, the theft of one of his motorcycles, and the high cost of \nliving where he was stationed in the military. (Tr. 42-78, 102, 165-174; Answer; GE 3-6, \n10, 11; AE A) \nIn 2019, Applicant entered into an agreement with a debt consolidation company \n(DCC) to get a grip on his finances and to settle his consumer debts. He enrolled the \nSOR debts, as well as other consumer debts not listed in the SOR. Pursuant to their \nagreement, the DCC negotiates settlement agreements with enrolled creditors. \nApplicant pays a monthly fee into a DCC account that it uses to make payments to \ncreditors with whom it has made a settlement agreement. (Tr. 42-78, 167; Answer; GE \n3, 10, 11; AE A) \nAfter about six months of his paying monthly fees to the DCC with no resolution \nof his debts, Applicant pulled out of the agreement and attempted to negotiate with \ncreditors on his own. While attempting to resolve his delinquencies on his own, he was \nable to pay one debt that is not listed in the SOR, but because of his limited income at \nthe time, he was unable to resolve any other delinquent debts. (Tr. 42-46, 167; Answer; \nGE 3, 10, 11; AE A) \nIn August 2021, when Applicant began his current employment and earned more \nincome, he again enrolled with the DCC to resolve his delinquencies. Since that time, \nhe has paid at least $832 per month to the DCC toward the resolution of all his SOR \ndebts and two other delinquent accounts not included in the SOR.

His intention is to continue to pay the \nDCC to negotiate and settle the remaining SOR debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c) on his \nbehalf. He is not delinquent on any other accounts. (Tr. 42-78, 165-174; Answer; GE 1, \n3-6, 10, 11; AE A) \nIn August 2008, while he was serving in the Army and deployed abroad, \nApplicant\u2019s command found that he had created a toxic work environment for his \nsubordinates. His command disciplined him with an Article 15 under the Uniform Code \nof Military Justice (UCMJ). He forfeited part of his pay, and he had to serve extra duty. \nHis command also disqualified him for the Good Conduct Medal for that deployment. He \nclaimed that this discipline resulted from a personality clash with one of his leaders who \nApplicant believes created the toxic work environment. He also claimed that an Article \n15 is not a serious punishment because it is non-judicial, is often used for \u201cminor \nconduct issues,\u201d and that the Army requires the destruction of Article 15 documentation \nno more than two years after the punishment is imposed. He also provided positive \ncharacter reference letters from soldiers who served with him on this deployment. (Tr. \n78-81, 174-181; Answer; GE 3; AE B) \nIn April 2012, Applicant inappropriately certified an Army Physical Fitness Score \nCard (APFSC). Despite knowing he was required to witness a soldier\u2019s physical fitness \ntest to sign an APFSC, he signed one of his subordinate soldier\u2019s APFSC without \nwitnessing the fitness test. When his command learned that the soldier had, in fact, \nfailed his physical fitness test, Applicant was disciplined under Article 15 of the UCMJ \nfor a violation of Article 107. He claimed that he signed the APFSC as a favor to the \nsoldier, who he trusted, based upon that soldier\u2019s misrepresentations to him and the \nsoldier\u2019s past physical fitness test results. When he signed the APFSC, he claimed he \ndid not know that the contents on the card were inaccurate. However, he acknowledged \nthat he should not have signed it without witnessing the soldier\u2019s physical fitness test. \nHe was reducted in rank, forfeited part of his pay for two months, and ordered to \nperform extra duty. He claimed that, as a result of this incident, he learned to trust but \nverify and that he has not falsified a document since then. (Tr. 81-95, 181-184; Answer; \nGE 3, 9) \nIn about May 2019, after an AR 15-6 investigation, Applicant\u2019s commanding \nofficer (COL A) found that Applicant engaged in sexual harassment while he was \ninstructing Reserve Officers\u2019 Training Corps (ROTC) cadets as a supervisor on a \ncollege campus. He vehemently denies that he engaged in any behavior that could be \nconsidered sexual harassment, but he acknowledged engaging in unprofessional \nconduct. He claimed that the decision to conduct the AR 15-6 investigation was made \nafter an Army Captain made a complaint to Applicant\u2019s superior officer (COL B) about \nApplicant\u2019s conduct towards a female cadet during a large ROTC training exercise. He \nclaimed that the Army Captain made this complaint despite the cadet in question saying \nthat she had no issues or complaints about Applicant\u2019s behavior.

Applicant \nclaimed that he did not get along with either COL B or MSG C and both may have had \nulterior motives with respect to their role. For example, Applicant had been sent to \nreplace MSG C, but MSG C stayed, creating an uncomfortable work environment where \nMSG C saw Applicant as a rival. Applicant claimed that MSG C coached and pressured \nwitnesses, thus unfairly biasing the resulting investigation and findings. However, he \ndoes not claim that COL A had any ulterior motives or was biased towards him. (Tr. 97-\n102, 106-110, 184-202, 226-228; Answer; GE 3, 7-9) \nThe AR 15-6 investigation revealed that, while many cadets had no issues with \nApplicant\u2019s behavior towards them, several female ROTC cadets at the college were \nmade to feel uncomfortable by comments he made about their appearance and the \nmanner in which he said them. At least one of these cadets said his comments made \nher sick to her stomach. Several claimed that they avoided him based upon how \nuncomfortable he made them feel. The investigating officer found that Applicant had not \nengaged in actions that could be considered sexual harassment, but that Applicant did \nengage in inappropriate and unprofessional conduct. However, COL A disagreed and \nfound that Applicant had engaged in sexual harassment towards female cadets. (Tr. \n113-118, 184-202, 206-211; Answer; GE 3, 8) \nIn April 2019, Applicant signed a developmental counseling form acknowledging \nthat he was being counseled for inappropriate behavior towards cadets. He further \nacknowledged that he was being removed as a cadet instructor and that he was not \npermitted to be alone with female cadets until further notice. I find this action constitutes \nhim being \u201cdisciplined for misconduct.\u201d He certified a statement from the summary of \none of his security interviews that he also received a Letter of Reprimand (LOR), but he \nlater testified that he did not receive an official LOR. After COL A made his findings after \nthe conclusion of the AR 15-6 investigation, Applicant had an opportunity to appeal \nthose findings. He did not appeal because the result of not appealing was that the Army \nwould reassign him to another role, which is what he desired. After waiving his appeal, \nhe was removed from his role at the college because he could no longer hold a special \ntrust authority role. However, he also testified that he was not formally disciplined, and \nthat he was permitted to be around cadets unsupervised after the AR 15 investigation \nconcluded if it was incidental to tasks he was assigned. However, the action removing \nhim as a cadet supervisor and the order prohibiting his interaction with female cadets \nunsupervised was never formally lifted. Despite these actions and the sexual \nharassment finding, COL B sent Applicant to supervise ROTC cadets at a six-week \ntraining course during the summer of 2019, because MSG C did not want to attend. \nApplicant claims that this fact tends to show that COL B and MSG C knew that the AR \n15-6 investigation findings were unfounded.

In the 2019 Memo, among other things, he wrote that the May 2019 sexual \nharassment finding was the \u201conly allegation of misconduct during my entire military \ncareer.\u201d Immediately after this sentence, he more specifically stated that he had never \nbeen the recipient of an Army Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention \n(SHARP) complaint. Therefore, in the 2019 Memo, he claimed that he had not had any \nother allegations of misconduct and he had never had a SHARP complaint. This \nstatement that he had no other allegations of misconduct was inaccurate, as the Army \ndisciplined him for misconduct in 2008 and 2012, as referenced herein. He claimed that \nhe mistakenly wrote this sentence and meant to write that he had not been disciplined \nbefore or after in the context of a SHARP allegation. However, he specifically made that \nstatement in the next sentence, which would have made the first sentence superfluous if \nhe truly was limiting the scope to the SHARP context. He claimed that he is a poor \nwriter and the words he wrote are not what he meant. He also asserted that he did not \nintend to mislead or deceive by making this statement and that he assumed that his \nArmy records were readily available to the DOD CAF. (Tr. 141-147, 179, 202-204; \nAnswer; GE 3, 9) \nWith respect to his role as an ROTC cadet supervisor, Applicant certified that he \nhad not received a written warning and had not been disciplined for misconduct in the \nworkplace in the last seven years on his certified Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing dated December 14, 2021 (2021 SF 86). He was required to \ndivulge this information as a result of the 2019 sexual harassment finding and the \ndiscipline for misconduct he received of not being permitted to interact with female \ncadets, and his subsequent removal from his post. He claimed that he did not divulge \nthis information because he had not been formally disciplined or suspended as a result \nof the AR 15-6 investigation. He also claimed that he misread the plain meaning of the \nquestions in the 2021 SF 86 and thought that he was only required to divulge security \nviolations. Finally, he assumed that his Army records were readily available to those \nmaking decisions about his security clearance eligibility. He claimed that he never \nmeant to hide information, or to mislead or deceive when he failed to divulge this \ninformation. He did not volunteer this discipline or suspension before the DOD \ninvestigator confronted him with it during his January 2022 security interview. During a \nfollow-up interview with another DOD investigator in April 2022, Applicant was \nforthcoming with information regarding the 2019 AR 15-6 investigation. (Tr. 135-141, \n204-217; Answer; GE 1, 3, 7, 8) \nAuthorized DOD investigators interviewed Applicant on January 14, 2022, \nJanuary 18, 2022, and April 6, 2022. These investigators drafted summaries of the \ninterviews they conducted with him. The investigator who drafted the summary from the \nJanuary 28, 2022 interview wrote that Applicant told him that Applicant did not have any \ndisciplinary issues before or after he was a supervisor of ROTC cadets. On August 14, \n2022, he certified, in writing, that he made this statement to the investigator. He \nappended to this certification over 250 pages of additional documents. Therefore, it is \nhard to believe that he rushed through this certification or did not provide it the attention \nit deserved.

Despite certifying other similar statements \nabout his lack of Army discipline in his interview summaries, he claimed that the \ninvestigators either misquoted him or he misunderstood the scope of their questions. He \nalso claimed that he made mistakes by not clarifying or appending some of the \nstatements from his security interviews that he certified. (Tr. 147-162, 179, 213-217; \nAnswer; GE 3) \nApplicant cited to the fact that he disclosed the aforementioned 2012 UCMJ \nArticle 15 discipline in his March 20, 2017 Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (2017 SF 86) as evidence that he was not trying to hide his prior Army \ndiscipline. He also claimed that he thought anyone making a decision regarding his \nsecurity clearance eligibility would have access to his military records, so he assumed \nthat anything he did not disclose would be readily available. He provided a plethora of \npositive whole-person evidence in the form of character-reference letters, his testimony, \nthe testimony of one of his friends who is also a former Army colleague and superior, \nand his almost exclusively positive Army performance evaluations. The individual who \ntestified at hearing on Applicant\u2019s behalf felt so strongly about Applicant\u2019s character that \nhe paid for an airline ticket and flew to the hearing from out of state. Applicant\u2019s \ncharacter evidence, that at least 36 individuals provided, reflects that he is honest, \nreliable, hard-working, of good moral character, and loves his country. Many of those \nwho provided character references are current or former servicemembers and some \nhold security clearances. Some were ROTC cadets under Applicant\u2019s supervision. \nNearly all these individuals opined that they believe Applicant should keep his security \nclearance. Applicant also received numerous commendations and awards throughout \nhis military career. He has also earned many professional awards and has been \ncommended for his performance with his current employer. (Tr. 31-32, 35-41, 135, 145-\n147, 162-163, 205-206, 220-235; Answer; GE 2, 3; AE B) \nApplicant provided evidence that he received mental health counseling from a \nDoctor of Psychology for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) between 2017 and \n2021. This counselor opined that Applicant does not suffer from a mental health \ncondition that would impair his judgment, and that she believed he should be permitted \nto hold a security clearance. She noted that he was receptive to her counseling and \nproactive in implementing it. (Tr.134-135; Answer; GE 3) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had five delinquent debts totaling approximately $49,000. Several of \nthese debts were delinquent for many years. The above-referenced disqualifying \nconditions are applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies were caused by divorce, underemployment, and the \ntheft of his motorcycle. These conditions were largely beyond his control. By engaging \nthe services of the DCC, regularly paying into the fund that the DCC uses to settle his \ndebts, and satisfying several SOR and other debts, all before the SOR was issued, \nApplicant has shown that he has acted responsibly under the circumstances. Through \nthese efforts, he has also shown that he initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors. AG \u00b6 20(b) and AG \u00b6 20(d) fully apply. He has mitigated the \nfinancial considerations security concerns. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect\n \n \n \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity eligibility determination, or other government official; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer\u2019s time or resources. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn 2008, 2012, and 2019, while he was serving in the Army, Applicant engaged in \ninstances of workplace misconduct for which he was disciplined. Two of these incidents \ninvolved him creating hostile work environments. The 2019 incident resulted in a finding \nthat he had engaged in sexual harassment. \nApplicant\u2019s explanations for why he omitted or misstated his disciplinary \ninformation strain credulity. He was clearly disciplined for misconduct by his superior \nofficer while he was supervising ROTC cadets in 2019. The plain meaning of the \nquestion in the 2021 SF 86 required him to report this discipline. \nI also find it difficult to believe that both he (in the 2019 Memo) and the DOD \ninvestigator mistakenly reported the same information (no discipline before or after the \n2019 incident) regarding his lack of disciplinary actions. I also find it hard to believe that \nApplicant failed to include any reference that his broad statements about his lack of \ndiscipline before or after the 2019 incident were limited to the SHARP context. In fact, in \nthe 2019 Memo he made separate claims about not having any disciplinary actions and \nnot having any SHARP allegations. He also clearly expended significant time and effort \non certifying the security interviews where he adopted the false information. \nI acknowledge that he included information in the 2017 SF 86 related to his 2012 \nmisconduct, but that fact cuts both for and against him. It shows that he was willing to \ndivulge this derogatory information, but it also shows that he understood that he should \ninclude disciplinary actions within seven years on his security questionnaire. It also \nshows that he understood that these reporting requirements were not limited to security \nincidents. For these reasons, I find that he deliberately omitted relevant facts from the \n2021 SF 86. I also find that he deliberately provided false information concerning \nrelevant facts to investigators and security officials. All the above-referenced Guideline \nE disqualifying conditions are established. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply in Applicant's case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \nWith respect to Applicant\u2019s 2008, 2012, and 2019 conduct that resulted in his \ndiscipline, I find that, considering his lengthy military and other professional career, he \nengaged in this conduct infrequently enough that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. It has also been over four \nyears since he last engaged in conduct that resulted in discipline. Therefore, I find that \nhe has mitigated the security concerns related to his conduct resulting in those \ndisciplinary actions (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a through 2.c). \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence that he corrected his omission of \nrelevant facts in the 2021 SF 86 or falsifications in his 2019 Memo or security interviews \nbefore being confronted with the facts. AG \u00b6 17(a) is not applicable. \nDeliberately omitting or providing false relevant information is not minor as it \nstrikes at the heart of the security clearance process. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s omission, \nand his false statements were not infrequent, and they did not happen under unique \ncircumstances. Instead, he omitted relevant information or provided false information on \nat least three occasions. He has not provided sufficient evidence that the behavior is \nunlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 17(b) does not apply. \nApplicant has undergone counseling. However, while I understand that he \nmaintains that his omission and falsifications were not deliberate, this continued reliance \nhas the unfortunate effect of meaning that he has not acknowledged his behavior. AG \u00b6 \n17(c) partially applies. \nAG \u00b6 17(e) has some applicability as well. Applicant\u2019s character reference letters \nand the testimony from his friend and former colleague show that others know about the \nallegations in the SOR, thus reducing his vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, and \nduress. The fact that he eventually spoke at length about his omission and falsifications \nto the DOD investigator after being confronted also reduces this vulnerability. \nApplicant\u2019s misconduct and discipline that led to his omission and falsifications \nare supported by official records and, in many cases, by his own statements. While I \nunderstand that he claimed that some of the allegations of misconduct against him were \nfrom sources of questionable reliability, this belief does not excuse his omission or false \nstatements. AG \u00b6 17(f) is not applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. I have also \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s honorable, high performing, and decorated military service. I \nconsidered the unwavering support that he enjoys among his friends, colleagues, and \npeers. However, I also considered that too often, Applicant asks me to believe his \nversion of events over official findings. He also asks me to make too many \nunreasonable leaps of faith about the intent behind his actions and his overly nuanced \njustifications for his omission and falsifications. Moreover, he asks me to disbelieve \nsome of his own written statements and certifications when they do not fit his narrative. \nConsidering the totality of the evidence and its context, I doubt the sincerity of his \nexplanations for not disclosing his conduct when required, and for making false \nstatements. There are simply too many instances of omitting relevant facts or providing \nfalse information and too many different, untimely, and illogical explanations for his \ndoing so. He has not provided sufficient mitigating evidence. It is not clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his eligibility for a security clearance. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns, but he did not mitigate the \npersonal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.d-2.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor for whom he has worked since November 2017. He received a high school diploma in 1995. He was married in 2002 and divorced in 2009. He remarried in 2010, but he separated from his second wife in 2015. He has two children, ages 19 and 16. He served on active duty with the U.S. Air Force from 1997 to 2003 and received an honorable discharge but was separated for an alcohol-treatment failure. (Items 2, 3) In the SOR, under Guideline F, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s eight delinquent debts totaling about $78,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.h). The largest of these debts was a $66,000 child support delinquency listed in SOR \u00b6 1.b. The Government also alleged that he misused his corporate credit card from September 2015 until March 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.i) Finally, it alleged that in July 2005, he filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition that was discharged in November 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.j). In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted these allegations except for SOR \u00b6 1.b, which he denied. He claimed that he brought this account current in 2016 or 2017. The Guideline F SOR allegations Including SOR \u00b6 1.b, are established through Applicant\u2019s admissions and the credit reports produced by the Government.

The Government exhibits included in the FORM (Items 1-11) are \nadmitted in evidence. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor for whom he has \nworked since November 2017. He received a high school diploma in 1995. He was \nmarried in 2002 and divorced in 2009. He remarried in 2010, but he separated from his \nsecond wife in 2015. He has two children, ages 19 and 16. He served on active duty \nwith the U.S. Air Force from 1997 to 2003 and received an honorable discharge but was \nseparated for an alcohol-treatment failure. (Items 2, 3) \nIn the SOR, under Guideline F, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s eight \ndelinquent debts totaling about $78,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.h). The largest of these \ndebts was a $66,000 child support delinquency listed in SOR \u00b6 1.b. The Government \nalso alleged that he misused his corporate credit card from September 2015 until March \n2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.i) Finally, it alleged that in July 2005, he filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy \npetition that was discharged in November 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.j). In his response to the SOR, \nApplicant admitted these allegations except for SOR \u00b6 1.b, which he denied. He claimed \nthat he brought this account current in 2016 or 2017. The Guideline F SOR allegations \nIncluding SOR \u00b6 1.b, are established through Applicant\u2019s admissions and the credit \nreports produced by the Government. (Items 3, 7-11) \nApplicant provided no evidence concerning the resolution or attempted resolution \nof the SOR debts, except for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. He claimed that he resolved \nthe child support delinquency in SOR \u00b6 1.b by bringing the account current in 2016 or \n2017, but he provided no documents to corroborate this claim. The Government\u2019s 2018, \n2019, 2021, and 2022 credit reports reflect this account as an account in collections. \nThe 2022 credit report reflects a balance that is higher than that listed in the SOR. Any \nadverse information not alleged in the SOR, such as the increased balance associated \nwith the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.b cannot be used for disqualification purposes, however \nit may be considered in assessing an applicant\u2019s credibility; in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; in considering whether \nthe applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; and in applying the whole-\nperson concept. (ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017)). He has \nneither resolved, nor is he in the process of resolving, any of the SOR debts. He \npresented no evidence to show he has participated in financial counseling or has a \nworking budget. He did not present evidence of his current financial situation. (Items 1, \n3, 8-11) \nApplicant failed to report any financial delinquencies on the Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions (SF 86) he submitted in January 2018. He was required to \nreport the delinquency alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. During his November 2018 security \ninterview, he did not disclose this financial delinquency until the investigator confronted \nhim with it. He denied that he deliberately failed to disclose the delinquent debt in SOR \n\u00b6 1.b because he believed that the debt was not delinquent and he therefore did not \nneed to disclose it.

(Items \n1, 3) \nFrom about September 2015 until about March 2016, Applicant misused his \nemployer-issued credit card by charging about $2,500 to it for personal housing \nexpenses. He claimed that he needed the money because of his separation from his \nspouse. He claimed that he promptly paid the money back through a loan from his \nretirement account. He claimed his employer did not discipline him for this misuse. He \nprovided no documentary evidence related to this incident. (Items 1-3) \nApplicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in July 2005. The bankruptcy court \ngranted him a Chapter 7 discharge in November 2005. There is no evidence in the \nrecord as to the reason he filed bankruptcy or the amount of the debt that was \ndischarged. (Item 7) \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his 2015 separation from his spouse \nand the financial burden of his child support payments. He claimed that he is paying \nabout $3,500 per month for child support, which is more than he earns. He claimed that \nhe is trying to have his ex-wife agree to a lower amount. He provided no documentary \nevidence of the amount of his monthly obligation, how much he earns per month, or any \nefforts to resolve the issue. (Items 1-3, 8-11) \nApplicant\u2019s estranged spouse alleged that in about November 2015, Applicant \nthreatened to harm her repeatedly over the telephone. She alleged that he hacked her \ne-mail account and sent sexually explicit photographs of her to her work colleagues and \nher lawyer. She also alleged that he posted sexually explicit photographs of her online. \nShe alleged that she feared for her safety because of Applicant\u2019s actions and \nstatements towards her. In December 2015, based upon these allegations, she filed a \npetition for injunction for protection against domestic violence against Applicant. On \nFebruary 24, 2016, a court awarded his estranged spouse a final judgment of injunction \nfor protection against domestic violence (\u201cprotection order\u201d or \u201cPO\u201d) against Applicant. \nApplicant was provided notice and an opportunity to be heard at the hearing, but he did \nnot attend. The court found that Applicant\u2019s estranged spouse had been a victim of \ndomestic violence or that she had reasonable cause to believe that she was in imminent \ndanger of becoming a victim of domestic violence by Applicant. In his response to the \nSOR, Applicant admitted sending an unspecified \u201ce-mail,\u201d but denied improperly \naccessing her e-mail account because they both had access to one another\u2019s accounts. \nHe also denied sending sexually explicit photographs of his estranged wife. (Items 1, 5) \nIn about June 2010, Applicant was arrested and charged with battery against his \nthen-girlfriend (now estranged spouse). He was found guilty, sentenced to a month in \njail, placed on probation for a year, and was ordered to attend anger management \ncourses. He claimed that he has fulfilled all the requirements of his conviction. The \narrest and conviction resulted from him throwing a beer can at the victim that hit her in \nthe face. He also pushed her out of a chair. He had been drinking alcohol at the time. \nImmediately following this incident, she agreed to allow him to drive her to a hotel. \nHowever, while she was in the car, she became fearful of him again and jumped out of \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe car while it was at a stoplight. At a minimum, he committed the crime of battery and \nengaged in domestic violence while he was consuming alcohol. (Items 1, 3, 4, 6) \nIn August 2010, Applicant was charged with driving with a suspended license. He \nbelieved that his license was suspended for his failure to pay child support obligations. \nHe was found guilty of this charge. He admitted to the conduct but claimed that he did \nnot realize that his license was suspended. In March 2011 he was charged with \nviolating the terms of his probation because of driving on a suspended license. He was \nfound guilty of violating the terms of his probation. In December 2011, he was again \ncharged with driving on a suspended license. (Items 1, 3, 4, 6) \nIn November 2010, Applicant was charged with violating the terms of his \nprobation when he tested positive for methamphetamine after taking a court-ordered \ndrug test. He claimed that he tested positive because he took some of his wife\u2019s \nprescription Adderall. He did not have a prescription for Adderall when he tested \npositive. He was found guilty of violating the terms of his probation. (Items 1, 3, 6) \nIn about September 2007, Applicant was charged with misdemeanor driving \nunder the influence of alcohol (DUI). The charges were ultimately dismissed after \nApplicant paid fines and attended court-ordered alcohol treatment classes. I consider \nhis payment of fines and attendance of treatment classes as an admission of the \nunderlying criminal conduct. (Items 1, 3, 6) \nIn about January 2004, Applicant was driving with an open container of alcohol in \nhis car. He was charged with a moving violation and pleaded guilty. He was required to \npay fines and he did so. (Items 1, 3) \nBetween about June and July 2002, Applicant attended command-directed \nalcohol counseling and treatment while he was in the military. These counseling \nsessions were about eight hours daily and lasted about four weeks. During this \ntreatment and counseling, he was diagnosed with alcohol abuse. Despite this treatment, \nhe was administratively separated from the Air Force in February 2003 for alcohol \nrehabilitation failure. (Items 1, 3) \nIn about May 2002, Applicant was arrested and charged with battery against his \nfirst wife. He pleaded no contest and was placed on probation and required to pay fines. \nHe was also required to complete an anger management course. He and his ex-wife \nengaged in a physical confrontation when both had been consuming alcohol. Applicant \nhas fulfilled all the requirements that resulted from his pleading no contest. (Items 1, 3, \n5, 6) \nIn about April 2000, Applicant was arrested and charged with disturbing the \npeace outside of a restaurant. He was making threats and appeared to be under the \ninfluence of alcohol. He pleaded no contest and paid required fines. As part of his \nsentence, he was ordered not to return to the restaurant.

(Item \n3) \nUnder Guideline J, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s arrests and underlying \nconduct, the entry of the PO and underlying conduct, and his probation violations and \nunderlying conduct (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a through 2.g). Under Guideline G, the Government \nalleged Applicant\u2019s 2002 alcohol counseling, his \u201calcohol abuse\u201d diagnosis, his \nseparation from the military for alcohol rehabilitation failure, and his 2004 citation for \ndriving with an open alcohol container (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a through 3.c). It also cross-alleged \nhis 2002 arrest for battery, his 2007 arrest for DUI, and his 2010 arrest for battery, along \nwith the underlying conduct (SOR \u00b6 3.d). Under Guideline E, the Government alleged \nthat Applicant falsified his SF 86 because he failed to list his delinquent child-support \naccount in it (SOR \u00b6 4.a). It also cross-alleged the delinquent child-support account, his \nmisuse of his employer-issued credit card, his arrests (and the underlying conduct), his \nprobation violations (and the underlying conduct), the entry of the PO (and the \nunderlying conduct), and it cross-alleged SOR \u00b6\u00b6 3.a through 3.c (SOR \u00b6 4.b). (Item 1) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, check fraud, expense account fraud, mortgage fraud, filing \ndeceptive loan statements and other intentional financial breaches of trust. \nApplicant had several delinquent debts totaling about $78,000. His child support \nbalance, which is the most significant of these debts, has been delinquent for several \nyears. Applicant misused his employer-issued credit card, which constitutes employee \nan intentional financial breach of trust. He needed bankruptcy protection in 2005, so he \nhad earlier financial difficulties. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nIt has been about 17 years since Applicant filed bankruptcy and there is no \nevidence that he has filed again. I find that a bankruptcy filing is unlikely to recur and \nfind in Applicant\u2019s favor with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.j. It has been about seven years since \nhe misused his employer\u2019s credit card. He promptly paid back the money that was \nowed. I find that this behavior happened so long ago that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nI find in Applicant\u2019s favor with respect to SOR \u00b6 1.i. \nThere is no documentary evidence in the record of payments to or payment \narrangements with creditors for the SOR debts. Applicant claimed that he brought the \nchild support account current in 2016 or 2017. This is a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of the debt. However, he did not provide documents to substantiate the \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndispute, such as proof of payment or an acknowledgement from the creditor that the \naccount was current. He did not provide evidence of actions he took to resolve the \ndispute. It is reasonable to expect Applicant to present documentation about the \nresolution of specific debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, \n2016). \nAs there is no documentary evidence to show that the SOR debts were resolved \nor appropriately disputed, I cannot find that Applicant has acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Likewise, I cannot find that he has made a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. He has not provided evidence to show a \ntrack record of financial responsibility. Applicant\u2019s financial issues are ongoing and I \ncannot find that they are unlikely to recur. He has not mitigated the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant has been charged with numerous criminal offenses. For most of these \noffenses there is sufficient evidence of criminal conduct, as he pleaded guilty or no \ncontest, the victim made a credible allegation against him, or there were police reports. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying condition. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment;  \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nWhile acknowledging the serious and violent nature of some of his criminal \nactions, it has been over seven years since Applicant engaged in criminal behavior. The \nsignificant amount of time that has elapsed is persuasive evidence of successful \nrehabilitation, that the criminal behavior is unlikely to recur, and that it no longer casts \ndoubt on his reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. The criminal conduct \nsecurity concerns are mitigated. \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder; \n(d) diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical \nsocial worker) of alcohol use disorder;  \n(e) the failure to follow treatment advice once diagnosed; and \n(f) alcohol consumption, which is not in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations, after a diagnosis of alcohol use disorder. \nApplicant drove while under the influence of alcohol and drove with an open \nalcohol container. While consuming alcohol, he breached the peace and engaged in \nphysical violence against his spouse. He was diagnosed with \u201calcohol abuse.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n22(a), AG \u00b6 22(c), and AG \u00b6 22(d) are established. AG \u00b6 22(e) and AG \u00b6 22(f) are not \nestablished. There is no evidence in the record that Applicant was advised to abstain \nfrom consuming alcohol. Therefore, there is no evidence that his current level of \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nconsuming one to two beers once or twice a week is inconsistent with treatment \nrecommendations. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following is potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment. \nIt has been about 12 years since Applicant has had an alcohol-related incident \nsuch as those described in AG \u00b6 22(a). This extended length of time without alcohol-\nrelated incidents provides sufficient evidence that Applicant no longer habitually \nconsumes alcohol or \u201cbinges\u201d on alcohol to the extent that it impairs his judgment. The \n12 years that has elapsed is persuasive evidence that his excessive alcohol \nconsumption is unlikely to recur, and that it no longer casts doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. The alcohol consumption security concerns are \nmitigated. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity eligibility determination, or other government representative; and \n10 \n (b)\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson assessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nApplicant claimed that he did not divulge his delinquent child support account in \nhis SF 86 or volunteer it during his security interview because he thought he brought the \naccount current in 2016 or 2017. He claimed he did not know the account was \ndelinquent or that he was required to report it. I find this explanation to be a reasonable \none. I also note that Applicant listed other derogatory financial information on his SF 86 \n(misuse of his employer-issued credit card). This action undermines the notion that \nApplicant was deliberately attempting to hide derogatory information. Given these \nconsiderations, I find that there is insufficient evidence that he deliberately provided \nfalse information or concealed or omitted relevant information. AG \u00b6 16(a) and AG \u00b6 \n16(b) are not established. \nApplicant has financial issues. He has committed criminal acts and alcohol was \nconsistently involved in his criminal and other negative incidents. He was diagnosed \nwith \u201calcohol abuse,\u201d and he was separated from the military because of failed alcohol \nrehabilitation. Applicant\u2019s financial issues are covered by Guideline F and are sufficient \nfor an adverse determination under Guideline F. Guideline E is not established with \nrespect to Applicant\u2019s financial issues. His criminal acts and alcohol-related issues, \nwhile covered by Guideline J and Guideline G, are not sufficient for an adverse \ndetermination under those guidelines. These issues support an assessment of \nquestionable judgment, unreliability, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, \nor other characteristics indicating that he may not properly safeguard classified or \nsensitive information. AG \u00b6 16(c) is raised by Applicant\u2019s criminal and alcohol-related \nconduct. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns. The following mitigating condition potentially applies in Applicant's case: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior\nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \n \n \nFor the reasons I included in my analysis of the Guideline J and Guideline G \nmitigating conditions, such as the passage of a significant amount of time without \nrecurrence, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s criminal and alcohol-related conduct is unlikely to \nrecur. For these same reasons, I find that this behavior no longer casts doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Personal conduct security concerns are \nmitigated. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F, J, G, and E in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered \nApplicant\u2019s military service and his honorable discharge. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude he did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns, but he did mitigate the criminal \nconduct, alcohol consumption, and personal conduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i-1.j: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.g: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline G:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 3.a-3.d: \nFor Applicant \n12 \n\n \n \n \n                  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nParagraph 4, Guideline E:    \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 4.a-4.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all of the allegations with explanations. His admissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a careful review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 32 years old. He has worked for a defense contractor since December 2019, as a technology specialist. From October 2019 to December 2019, he was unemployed. He is a high school graduate and has taken some college courses. He is currently engaged and he has one child from this relationship. His significant other also has a child. (Tr. 6-7, 26-27, 46; GE 1) The SOR alleged Applicant had nine delinquent student loans, in collection status, totaling approximately $40,000. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.i) It also alleged that he failed to file his 2017 to 2021 federal and state income tax returns, as required, (SOR \u00b6 1.j) Applicant admitted the nine delinquent student loans. He took out the student loans in the period of 2010 to 2014 when he attended art school. He further admitted that he has not made any payments toward these debts. The reasons he gave for failing to pay toward the debts were that he believed his parents were paying these loans until he had a falling out with them. He admitted not following up to set up his own payment process. The other reason he gave was that when he checked with a commercial credit reporting service, it indicated that the student loans had reverted back to the government.

The record remained open and Applicant \nsubmitted AE C-D, which were admitted into evidence. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on September 22, 2023. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations with explanations. His admissions are \nadopted as findings of fact. After a careful review of the pleadings and evidence, I make \nthe following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 32 years old. He has worked for a defense contractor since \nDecember 2019, as a technology specialist. From October 2019 to December 2019, he \nwas unemployed. He is a high school graduate and has taken some college courses. \nHe is currently engaged and he has one child from this relationship. His significant other \nalso has a child. (Tr. 6-7, 26-27, 46; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged Applicant had nine delinquent student loans, in collection \nstatus, totaling approximately $40,000. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.i) It also alleged that he failed to \nfile his 2017 to 2021 federal and state income tax returns, as required, (SOR \u00b6 1.j) \nApplicant admitted the nine delinquent student loans. He took out the student \nloans in the period of 2010 to 2014 when he attended art school. He further admitted \nthat he has not made any payments toward these debts. The reasons he gave for failing \nto pay toward the debts were that he believed his parents were paying these loans until \nhe had a falling out with them. He admitted not following up to set up his own payment \nprocess. The other reason he gave was that when he checked with a commercial credit \nreporting service, it indicated that the student loans had reverted back to the \ngovernment. He thought that meant he no longer was responsible to pay them. He did \nnot take any further action until he received the SOR when he contacted the \nDepartment of Education directly and found out about the delinquent status of his loans. \nDocumentation from his current student loan servicer showed that as of July 2023, his \nstudent loans were in excess of $51,000. (Tr. 28, 30-31; AE C) \nApplicant claimed that he set up a payment plan but that plan was put on hold \nbecause of the student loan relief legislation resulting from COVID-19. His credit report \nfrom February 2022, shows that all of his student loans were placed in collection status \nin 2017, years before the COVID-19 relief. He most recently was sent a notice by his \nstudent loan servicer telling him that his loan payments will resume in October 2023. He \ndid not provide any payment information after receiving this notice. His student loans \nremain unresolved. (Tr. 28; GE 3; AE D) \nApplicant admitted that he failed to timely file his 2017-2021 federal and state tax \nreturns. In his October 2022 interrogatory responses, he stated the reason for his failure \nto file was because he did not have the means or resources to file and that \u201clife was \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \ndifficult.\u201d After receiving the SOR, he contacted a tax professional to assist in preparing \nhis unfiled tax returns. She supplied a letter on December 5, 2022, indicating that she \nwould have the returns prepared by December 7, 2022. Applicant claims his 2017-2021 \nfederal and state returns have been filed, although he does not remember when exactly. \nHe did not provide documentation of any returns received by the IRS or the state tax \nauthority. He provided a copy of a U.S. Postal Service receipt showing that on August 8, \n2023, three documents were mailed to his state\u2019s taxing authority and one document \nwas mailed to his regional IRS office. He provided no other correspondence concerning \nhis tax filing status. He testified that he has not filed his 2022 federal or state tax returns \n(I will not use his 2022 tax information for disqualifying purposes, but I may use it in my \ncredibility, mitigation, and whole-person analyses). His unfiled tax return issues remain \nunresolved. (Tr. 27-28, 38-43; AE A-B) \nApplicant produced a character letter from a personal friend who is a special \nagent for another government agency. The friend believes Applicant is honest, \ndemonstrates integrity, and possesses the highest moral character. The letter does not \nstate whether the author is aware of the circumstances of Applicant\u2019s case. (AE E). \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b6 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nApplicant has delinquent student loans that remain unpaid. He also failed to \ntimely file his 2017-2021 federal and state income tax returns. I find all the above \ndisqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns \narising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under \nAG \u00b6 20 and the following potentially apply: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant claims he filed all his state and federal tax returns for 2017-2021, \nhowever, he failed to provide documentation corroborating that claim. Even giving him \nthe benefit of the doubt that he did file those returns, such filing did not occur until after \nAugust 2023, years after they were due. He ultimately sought the services of a tax \npreparation professional, but again not until after he received the SOR. Since his action \nwas only prompted by receiving the SOR, his reliability and trustworthiness are called \ninto question. Applicant failed to describe any conditions beyond his control as a reason \nfor not timely filing his tax returns. Neither of the mitigating circumstances apply. \nApplicant failed to pay, or act upon, his delinquent student loans until he received \nthe SOR. His loans were delinquent before they went into COVID-19 deferment status. \nAs of October 2023, they are once again in an active pay status and Applicant did not \ndocument any plans to pay these loans. He did not provide sufficient mitigation \nevidence to establish the applicability of AG \u00b6 20(b), or any other mitigating condition. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered favorable character \nevidence. However, Applicant has not established a track record of financial \nresponsibility. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRobert E. Coacher \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",

(Items 2, 9, 10) \nIn about April 2021, Applicant began dating a woman (girlfriend). After several \nmonths, he and his girlfriend began having problems with their relationship. In June \n2021, they had an argument and he grabbed her by her hair and attempted to pull her \ninto his car. In September 2021, he attempted to strangle her. His girlfriend did not file \ncriminal charges at the time these events occurred. (Items 2, 4-7, 9) \nIn late December 2021, Applicant was visiting his girlfriend from out of town \naround Christmastime. At some point during his visit, they began arguing. During the \nargument, he attempted to strangle her and threatened to \u201cslump\u201d her and her family. \nGiven the context, I find that he meant that he would physically harm her and her family. \nOn December 24, 2021, his girlfriend went to the local magistrate\u2019s office and had a \nprotective order (PO) issued against him. The PO prohibited him from having contact \nwith his girlfriend. While she was applying for the PO, he harassed her by calling her on \nher cell phone numerous times. (Items 2, 4, 6) \nEarly on December 25, 2021, when police attempted to serve Applicant with the \nPO, he evaded their efforts and was verbally abusive towards them over the phone. \nPolice eventually found him \u201chunkered down in the driver\u2019s seat\u201d of his vehicle, which \nwas across the street from his girlfriend\u2019s residence. They asked him to exit his vehicle, \nbut he refused, so they physically escorted him. They served him with the PO and \narrested him. Police charged him with stalking and obstruction of justice. Later that \nmorning, he was released on bond and admonished that he must abide by the terms of \nthe PO.

After this incident, she drove to the police department \nto file criminal charges against him. Uncowed, he followed her in his vehicle at least part \nof the way to the police station. (Items 2, 4, 6-9) \nThat same day, police arrested Applicant again and charged him with violating \nthe PO, stalking, and assault and battery. The next day, his girlfriend filed a criminal \ncomplaint against him for grabbing her by the hair in June 2021 and strangling her in \nSeptember 2021. On December 28, 2021, he was arrested for the third time in four days \nand charged with committing assault and battery in September 2021. Courts ultimately \nfound him guilty of two violations of the PO. He was sentenced to six months in jail with \nfive months and 29 days suspended. The court either dismissed or entered orders of \nnolle prosequi on the remaining charges. The court also entered additional protective \norders that prohibited Applicant from having contact with his girlfriend until as late as \nFebruary 2024. On December 28, 2022, because of his criminal charges, he was barred \nfor 30 days from the military base where he worked. All his aforementioned criminal \nbehavior is corroborated by police reports and court records. (Items 2, 4-10) \nApplicant was required to divulge the crimes that resulted in his December 2021 \narrests on the Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) he submitted in \nJanuary 2022 (six days after his last arrest). He failed to do so. While it was not alleged \nin the SOR, he did not volunteer these arrests to the DOD investigator during his August \n2022 security interview. Instead, he was evasive about his criminal conduct. When the \ninvestigator asked Applicant about these arrests, he declined to elaborate on them, \nmerely claiming that he and his girlfriend were going through \u201cstuff\u201d and \u201crelationship \nthings.\u201d Applicant failed to elaborate on his underlying conduct related to these arrests \nuntil the DOD investigator asked him multiple times and confronted him with his arrests. \nHe has denied stalking or physically harming his girlfriend. He also denied threatening \nto harm his girlfriend and her family. He has not undergone any behavioral counseling \nor treatment. He claimed he did not divulge his criminal charges on the SF 86 because \nhe did not read the questions carefully, and he thought he did not need to disclose \ncharges for which he was awaiting court dates. (Items 2-9) \nA credit report reflects that Applicant\u2019s federal student loan account was charged \noff by August 2022. The Government listed this account in SOR \u00b6 2.a. An August 2022 \ncredit report reflected a last payment date of July 2021. The credit reports reflect that \nthe account was past due in the amount of $4,718 with a total loan balance of $44,082. \nA February 2023 credit report reflects that the account is still charged off, but that \nApplicant is paying under a partial payment agreement of $222 per month. This credit \nreport reflects a last payment date of January 2023. However, since about March 2020, \nfederal student loans repayments have been deferred under various executive orders \nbecause of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s federal \nstudent loan account was delinquent before the payments on it were deferred by \nPresidential executive order.

(ISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017)). \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.

By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant has been charged with several serious criminal offenses, and there is \nsufficient evidence of his criminal conduct in the form of guilty pleas, police reports, \ncourt records, and credible allegations from his victim. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthe above disqualifying condition. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIt has only been about one and one-half years since Applicant last engaged in \ncriminal behavior. His most serious criminal conduct occurred when he was having \nissues with a romantic relationship. While there is no bright line rule of how much time is \nsufficient to show mitigation, given the seriousness of his conduct, and his willingness to \ncontinue it despite being arrested the first time, I find that it has not been long enough. \nMoreover, problems with romantic relationships are not unusual. I cannot find that the \ncircumstances that led to his criminal behavior are unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 32(a) does not \napply. \nApplicant continues to deny that he assaulted or stalked his girlfriend. I find that \nhe did both. I believe he is being untruthful about a material fact relevant to a security \nclearance adjudication. Falsifying material information in a security clearance \nadjudication is a criminal offense under 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1001. Therefore, Applicant \ncontinues to engage in criminal behavior, further undercutting his efforts at mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6 32(a), as well as under AG \u00b6 32(d), which require the passage of time \nwithout recurrence of criminal acts. Given the recency of criminal activity, and his lack of \nacceptance of responsibility, AG \u00b6 32(a) and AG \u00b6 32(d) do not apply. AG \u00b6 32(c) does \nnot apply because there is reliable evidence of criminal conduct in the form of credible \nallegations, police reports, and court records. None of the Guideline J mitigating \nconditions apply. The criminal conduct security concerns are not mitigated. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s federal student loan payments were deferred because of the COVID-\n19 pandemic. There is no evidence that he defaulted on this loan prior to the automatic \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \ndeferral. The evidence is not sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. I find \nin his favor with respect to the Guideline F security concerns. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; and \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. \nApplicant did not divulge his December 2021 criminal charges on his SF 86 \ndespite being required to do so. He claimed that he did not understand that he had to \nreport criminal activity for which he had not gone to court. I find this explanation lacks \ncredibility and that he deliberately omitted these arrests. AG \u00b6 16(a) is established with \nrespect to his omissions. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nApplicant has committed several driving infractions and violated his probation \nrelated to one of those violations. These actions support an assessment of questionable \njudgment, unreliability, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that he may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive \ninformation. AG \u00b6 16(d) is raised by this conduct. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate personal conduct security \nconcerns. The following mitigating conditions potentially apply in Applicant's case: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nDeliberately omitting information from an SF 86 is not minor as it strikes at the \nheart of the security clearance process. Applicant did not volunteer his December 2021 \narrests before he was confronted by the investigator during his security interview. \nInstead, when the investigator asked about these arrests, Applicant attempted to \nconceal the specifics and minimize their severity. There is no evidence that he has \nobtained counseling or taken any other positive steps to show that such behavior is \nunlikely to recur or to reduce vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. None \nof the Guideline E mitigating factors apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances.

(GE 2) \nBetween April 2007 and February 2016, Applicant resided with his then-fiance \nwho in 2012 became his second spouse. (GE 2) For the first four years of their \nrelationship, Applicant shared half of his fiance\u2019s mortgage expenses. (GE 2) \nSeparating from his spouse in February 2016, Applicant briefly resided in a State A \napartment (February 2016 to July 2016) before moving on to State B without any \nevidence of voluntary spousal and child support to his second spouse of four years and \ntwo small children. (GE 2) \nWhat steps Applicant\u2019s second spouse pursued to induce Applicant to provide \nvoluntary spousal and child support prior to their May 2017 divorce is not fully \ndeveloped in the record. Some evidence of his possible post-divorce voluntary efforts to \nprovide monetary support to his wife and children is reflected in his 2021 personal \nsubject interview (PSI) acknowledgements that he became delinquent on his child \nsupport \u201cpayment of $10,000\u201d to his former spouse and children \u201cafter he lost his job.\u201d \n(GE 3) any pre-divorce child and spousal discussions he may have had with send \nspouse is not evidenced in the record. \nCredit reports confirm Applicant\u2019s accumulation of five delinquent consumer \naccounts between 2018 and 2021 as follows: SOR \u00b6 1.a (for $3,932); 1.b (for $556); 1.d \n(for $1,634); 1.e (for $1,021); and 1.f (for $6,558). (GEs 5-6) While Applicant disputed \none of these listed SOR debts (SOR \u00b6 1.a), he provided no documentary support for his \ndispute of the debt. None of the remaining consumer debts listed in the SOR are \nsupported by any documentation or other corroborating evidence of payment or \npayment arrangements. \nIncome withholding orders (IWOs) were issued by State B\u2019s child support \nservices agency to Applicant\u2019s employer in October and December 2018, respectively,\nin accordance with an issued 2016 court order in State A to withhold from Applicant\u2019s\nmonthly pay portions of his income to cover current and arrears child and spousal\nsupport. (AEs A-B) The 2018 IWOs issued by the State B child support services agency\ndirected Applicant\u2019s employer to deduct monthly amounts as follows: $1,413.90 a month\nfor current child support; $468.70 a month for past-due child support-(arrears greater\nthan 12 weeks); $23.55 a month for current cash medical support; $7.98 a month for\npast-due medical support; and $1,516.16 a month for past-due spousal support, for a\ntotal amount withholding of $3,928 a month. (GEs 1-6 and AEs A-B; Tr. 18)  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBy all accounts, portions of Applicant\u2019s monthly income have been regularly \nwithheld by his employer between October 2018 and February 2023 in partial \ncompliance with the 2018 IWOs. (GEs 1-2) Asked at hearing whether spousal and child \nsupport have been withheld from his monthly pay, Applicant responded in the \naffirmative. (Tr. 27-28, 42-3) Applicant\u2019s acknowledgements were credible and were \naccepted by the Government in closing. (Tr. 48) Because Applicant\u2019s monthly \nwithholding has been consistently less than what was prescribed in the IWOs, his \nwithheld payments have never come close to the withholding amounts prescribed in the \n2018 IWOs.

(GEs 5-6) Without any credited \nreduction in the reported balance owing, the principal balance of the arrears can be \nexpected to increase over time. \nApplicant\u2019s efforts between 2019 and 2022 to meet with child support services \npersonnel \u201cto have the amount owed reduced and my child support order modified,\u201d to \ninclude reductions in his monthly child support withholding and overall principal balance, \nwere never successful. (GE 1; Tr. 28) And, meeting requests by the State B child \nsupport services agency to discuss Applicant\u2019s pay status could never be agreed on \nwith Applicant. (Tr. 27) \nA revised IWO was issued to Applicant\u2019s employer in February 2023. (GE 7) In \nthis IWO, Applicant\u2019 s employer was directed to withhold portions of Applicant\u2019s pay in \naccordance with a revised withholding schedule, Applicant\u2019s employer was directed to \nwithhold monthly amounts from Applicant\u2019s pay as follows: $1,413.90 a month for \ncurrent child support; $180.68 a month for past-due child support (arrears greater than \n12 weeks); $23.55 a month for current cash medical support; $4.65 a month for past-\ndue cash medical support, and $314.67 a month for past-due spousal support, for a \ntotal amount withheld of $1,937.45 a month. (GE 7)  \nCurrently, Applicant\u2019s employer withholds between $150 to $200 bi-weekly (still \n50 % of his take-home pay) to cover the withholding criteria se by State B\u2019s withholding \norders. (Tr. 40) Based on the evidence presented, Applicant and his employer have \ncomplied with been in compliance with the issued February 2023 IW0. Applicant \ncurrently makes $20 an hour, which represents a increase over his hourly pay in 2018 \n(only $15 an hour). (Tr. 21) In addition to his hourly wages, he receives a 70 % disability \nfrom the Veterans Administration (VA) that amounts to $2,000 a month. While he was \nunemployed for a year after being \u201cwritten off of his contract\u201d in September 2017, he \nmade no child support payments; even though he received notices of the IWOs from the \nchild support agencies in both State A and State B. (GE 2; Tr. 24) \nApplicant\u2019s efforts to enforce his child visiting rights with his ex-spouse and \nmother of his two children have not been successful. She has consistently denied him \nvisiting privileges with his children. (Tr. 46) Further, he has had no communications with \nhis ex-spouse about enlisting her support and assistance in his efforts to obtain child \nsupport reductions. (Tr. 45) \nApplicant currently rents his home ($1,000 a month) and expends $840 a month \non an expensive vehicle he purchased in 2019, which he characterized as his \u201cdream \ncar.\u201d (GEs 5-6; Tr.30-31, 38) He is in compliance with his payment obligations with his \ncurrent credit card accounts.

These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. These guidelines must be \nconsidered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive \nreliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in \narriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds. .  .  . AG \u00b6 18. \n  Burdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. \n2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

These collective debt delinquencies and 2023 child and \nspousal support order in place warrant the application of three of the disqualifying \nconditions (DC) of the financial considerations guidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to \nsatisfy debts\u201d; 19(b), \u201cunwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so\u201d; \nand 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d Each of these DCs apply to \nthe specific facts of Applicant\u2019s situation. \nApplicant\u2019s admitted delinquent debts require no independent proof to \nsubstantiate them. See Directive 5220.6 at E3.1.1.14; McCormick on Evidence \u00a7 262 \n(6th ed. 2006). His admitted delinquent debts are fully documented and create judgment \nissues as well over the management of his finances. See ISCR Case No. 03-01059 \n(App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004). \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies is critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nApplicant\u2019s cited explanations for his debt delinquencies (primarily due to losing \nhis job in 2017 and becoming depressed with suicidal symptoms) are insufficient to \nwarrant the full application of any of the potentially available mitigating conditions to his \nreported delinquent consumer debts. MC \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d has some application to Applicant\u2019s \ncircumstances in light of his cited periods of unemployment and spousal separations. \nApplication of MC \u00b6 20(b) is very limited Applicant\u2019s case, however, for he has failed to \nsatisfy the \u201cthe acting responsibly\u201d prong of MC \u00b6. 20(b) following his return to full-time \nemployment in 2018. \nCurrently, Applicant has no well-developed financial plan or refined budget in \nplace to aid him in mitigating the Government\u2019s financial concerns over his delinquent \ndebts. And, with the exception of the consumer debt covered by SOR \u00b6 1.a (which he \ndisputes without documentary support), he has made no concerted efforts to resolve his \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ndelinquent accounts with the ample resources available to him over the past four years \nin which he has been gainfully employed on a full-time basis. \nOf continuing security concern are the two State B IWOs covering Applicant\u2019s \nchild and spousal support owed to his ex-wife residing in State A. By far, these IWOs \nthat have since been revised and consolidated under a February 2023 IWO represent \nApplicant\u2019s largest debt and currently exceed $146,307 in current and arrears child and \nspousal support. These IMOs have been in force since 2018 have consistently been \nenforced and complied with over the past five years without any breaks in withholding of \nthe calculated amounts deducted from Applicant\u2019s monthly income. \nWhile the income withheld from Applicant\u2019s monthly pay under the IWOs in force \nhave been involuntary, the withholdings are distinguishable from garnishments and \nattachments customarily used in enforcement actions. See ISCR Case No. 20-03457 at \n3-4 (App. Bd. June 15, 2023) Unlike customary garnishments, Applicant\u2019s withheld \nincome for child and spousal support (both current and arrears) are not considered \npunitive under the laws of his current state of residence. See A.R.S., \u00b6\u00b6 25-505 and 25-\n505.01. Rather, IWOs are treated as imposed payment obligations on Applicant to \nensure his children\u2019s comfort and well-being. Put another way, the income withholding \n(for both current and arrears child and spousal support) imposed on Applicant are \nconsidered under the IWO law of State B to be withholding for both current and arrears \namounts due and in this respect is distinguishable from garnishment.     \nStill, Applicant\u2019s income withholding in compliance with the IWOs in force in \nStates A and B cannot be considered sufficient to fully meet the good-faith repayment \nrequirements of MC \u00b6 20(d). For Applicant\u2019s withheld income to reflect good-faith \npayment initiatives, some form of voluntary acceptance of withholding on his part was \nrequired. Nothing in the recitations of the IWOs in issue make any mention of \nApplicant\u2019s concurrence in the issued IWOs. So while the IWOs in issue are \ndistinguishable from garnishments, they do not equate to any form of voluntary, good-\nfaith repayment actions on Applicant\u2019s part. \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nthe voluntary payment of accrued debts. See ISCR Case No. 19-02593 at 4-5 (App. Bd. \nOct. 18, 2021); ISCR Case No. 19-01599 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2020). Based on the \nevidence presented, Applicant is not able to demonstrate a sufficient tangible track \nrecord of actual debt reduction with respect to his consumer debt delinquencies to \nsatisfy Appeal Board guidance. \nBy contrast, the State B IWOs in force over the past five years that have dictated \nthe withholdings of his income to cover his current and arrears child and spousal \nsupport, reflect a considerable period of IWO compliance, even if they have not been \nfully implemented due to Applicant\u2019s minimal monthly income subject to withholding. \nFor so long as Applicant remains employed by his current employer, or other employer \nin State B, he can be expected to be subject to the IWOs in place until they expire, or \nare otherwise withdrawn. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n            \n \n \n                                      \n \n               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                            \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his finances are fully compatible with minimum standards for \nholding a clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 43 years old. He has been employed by a defense contractor since June 2020. He retired honorably with the rank of chief warrant officer 5 from the United States Army after 23 years and three months of service in September 2020. He has held a security clearance since 2001. He has a high school diploma and is taking university courses online. The most recent information available indicates that he is married and has four children ages 24, 10, 7, and 6. He is twice divorced. (Item 3) The SOR alleges four delinquent accounts that have been charged off totaling $25,139 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.d) and a utility account placed for collection for $133 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). Applicant admits all the debts. Though Applicant disputes he owed the money, after the SOR\u2019s issuance, he paid the utility account. The alleged debts are listed on a March 19, 2021 credit report, an April 1, 2022 credit report, and an October 19, 2022 credit report. (Items 1, and 5-7) Applicant reported a debt on a delinquent car loan in his Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), which he submitted in March 2021. He did not list any other delinquent debts. During his background interview in April 2021, Applicant admitted a past-due car loan that he said was not currently delinquent. He stated in March 2020 he was unable to keep his payments current due to his wife\u2019s job loss and COVID-19. He confirmed his answers in the SF-86 and noted no further debts.

He has been employed by a defense contractor since \nJune 2020. He retired honorably with the rank of chief warrant officer 5 from the United \nStates Army after 23 years and three months of service in September 2020. He has held \na security clearance since 2001. He has a high school diploma and is taking university \ncourses online. The most recent information available indicates that he is married and \nhas four children ages 24, 10, 7, and 6. He is twice divorced. (Item 3) \nThe SOR alleges four delinquent accounts that have been charged off totaling \n$25,139 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.d) and a utility account placed for collection for $133 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.e). Applicant admits all the debts. Though Applicant disputes he owed the money, after \nthe SOR\u2019s issuance, he paid the utility account. The alleged debts are listed on a March \n19, 2021 credit report, an April 1, 2022 credit report, and an October 19, 2022 credit \nreport. (Items 1, and 5-7) \nApplicant reported a debt on a delinquent car loan in his Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions (SF 86), which he submitted in March 2021. He did not list any other \ndelinquent debts. During his background interview in April 2021, Applicant admitted a \npast-due car loan that he said was not currently delinquent. He stated in March 2020 he \nwas unable to keep his payments current due to his wife\u2019s job loss and COVID-19. He \nconfirmed his answers in the SF-86 and noted no further debts. When confronted with the \ndebts during his ROI, Applicant admitted them. He stated he did not list them due to an \noversight regarding the requirements for listing. Applicant stated the debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d were solo credit cards. Further, he was not aware of the debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.c but did not dispute it. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e (a utility bill) he stated \nwas his, but he disputed the underlying charge due to a former landlord\u2019s failure to remove \nhim from the bill after he had moved. (Items 2-6) \nApplicant admitted the debts alleged in the SOR in his response to an interrogatory \nfrom the DODCAF. For the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.d, he admitted they were not \npaid, payment arrangements had not been made, and he was not making payments. He \nstated the alleged debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e had been paid. He stated he had run into hard times \nwith his family\u2019s expenses post his Afghanistan deployment and he overextended his \nfamily\u2019s finances. He admitted poor financial planning while on active duty. He states he \nhad been working with a credit counseling team to pay down his debts, but these were \ncharged off while he was actively paying on them. He states further, \u201c[n]ow that I am \nretired and able to afford to fix my mistakes, I am trying to do so by leveraging planners \nas well as legal to reduce the amount I have to pay and fix my credit within all the laws \nthat exist.\u201d He states that he stopped paying his charged-off debts on the advice of a \nwealth manager. He attached his 2021 W-2 and his 02/11/2022 pay stub as proof he has \nsufficient means to satisfy these debts. His personal financial statement indicates \nsufficient discretionary funds monthly. His credit reports also indicate he was able to pay \nseveral sizable car loans, though not always on time. (Items 4-7) \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant confirmed the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \n- 1.d. He reaffirmed he was not making payments, again based on the advice of his \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfinancial planner.

As in his response to the DODCAF interrogatories, \nhe again states he now has sufficient financial means, \u201cnow I have a great job, my wife is \nworking, and we are making good money and can pay off the debt. I sent my W2s in with \nthe original request for information showing that between retirement and salary I make \nover $300k\u2026I am in the best financial position that I have ever been in over the past 20 \nyears that I have had a clearance.\u201d (Item 1) \nApplicant provided evidence he has sufficient means to pay off the debts but has \nchosen not to do so based on his financial planner\u2019s advice. He has stated both in his \nresponse to the DODCAF interrogatories and in his response to the SOR that he \u201ccould \npay of the debt, but that will not clear it from [his credit] report.\u201d He asserted, as he did in \nhis response to the DODCAF interrogatories, that he would \u201cset up payments ASAP\u201d if \nhis clearance were at risk. (Items 1, 4) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of several variables known as the \u201cwhole-\nperson concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship transcends \nnormal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government reposes a \nhigh degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .. An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or \notherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including delinquent debts. He has \nprovided evidence of sufficient financial means to pay his debts but expressed his \nintention to leave them unsatisfied. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20.

It \ndoes not appear on the most recent credit report. That debt is mitigated. \nApplicant has known about the remaining debts for some period. He made \nassertions he had begun paying some of them but was then financially unable to do so \nwhile still on active duty. Though he provided evidence of his current financial situation, \nhe has expressly chosen to ignore the remaining debts. He mentioned he may have been \nthe victim of identity theft, that he had worked with fraud sections, and had gotten a debt \nconsolidation loan, but provided no additional corroboration to support his statements. He \nwas on notice his debts were of a concern to the government. He was confronted during \nhis interview regarding concerns about these debts, received and answered the \nDODCAF\u2019s interrogatories regarding concerns about these debts, received and replied to \nthe SOR specifically noting concerns about these debts, and received Department \nCounsel\u2019s File of Relevant Material, which also pointed to the concern over these debts. \nHe has demonstrated he has the means to resolve them and admits to affirmatively \nchoosing not to do so. He has stated he would attempt to do so should they put his \nclearance at risk. However, potential undefined intentions to resolve debts in the future \nare not a substitute for a track record of debt repayment or other responsible approaches. \nSee ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are the result of his admitted overextension of family \nfinances while on active duty and were exacerbated with his wife\u2019s loss of her job in 2020 \nand during the COVID-19 crises. Though he states he will attempt to resolve these debts \nif they will have an effect on his clearance, this inaction does not constitute good faith as \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncontemplated by Appeal Board precedent. It does not mitigate the security concerns \nraised by his conduct. It appears the primary catalyst that might lead him to address his \ndelinquencies is the desire for a security clearance. He has had the ability to pay his debts \nbut has chosen not to. His failure to act responsibly regarding his financial obligations \npreclude finding that he has good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) - 20(d) are not established \nregarding the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.d. Applicant did not meet his burden to mitigate \nthe financial concerns set out in the SOR. They continue to cast doubt on his current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that the security concerns arising out \nof Applicant\u2019s remaining delinquent debts are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 44 years old. He is married with five children. He has a high school diploma and some college. He is employed by a defense contractor as an Engineer. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. Guideline F - Financial Considerations The Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he made financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. The SOR alleges that the Applicant is indebted to eleven delinquent accounts totaling in excess of $20,156. Applicant admits each of the debts listed in the SOR. Credit reports of the Applicant dated September 7, 2007; February 17, 2018; September 30, 2021; April 22, 2022; and March 31, 2023, confirm the indebtedness. (Government Exhibits 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.) Applicant served in the U.S. Army from September 2000 until March 2006, and received an honorable discharge. He began working for his current employer in October 2017. Applicant stated that his financial problems resulted from an unexpected 55 percent salary reduction at work. His loss of income caused him to quit his job and move in order to find a job that paid enough to support his family. Applicant\u2019s wife lost her job about the same time.

The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information, \neffective within the DoD after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR (Answer) on March 3, 2023. (Item 2.) He \nrequested that his case be decided by an administrative judge on the written record. \nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on April 5, 2023.

Items \n1 through 9 will hereinafter be referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 9. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 44 years old. He is married with five children. He has a high school \ndiploma and some college. He is employed by a defense contractor as an Engineer. \nHe is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. \nThe SOR alleges that the Applicant is indebted to eleven delinquent accounts \ntotaling in excess of $20,156. Applicant admits each of the debts listed in the SOR. \nCredit reports of the Applicant dated September 7, 2007; February 17, 2018; September \n30, 2021; April 22, 2022; and March 31, 2023, confirm the indebtedness. (Government \nExhibits 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8.) Applicant served in the U.S. Army from September 2000 until \nMarch 2006, and received an honorable discharge. He began working for his current \nemployer in October 2017. \nApplicant stated that his financial problems resulted from an unexpected 55 \npercent salary reduction at work. His loss of income caused him to quit his job and \nmove in order to find a job that paid enough to support his family. Applicant\u2019s wife lost \nher job about the same time. Applicant explained that as a parent with a large family he \nfelt compelled to make some difficult decisions to make sure that he fed and took care \nof his family\u2019s needs. As a result he provided for his family and did not pay his bills. He \nstated that he is currently working with a credit repair company to begin to resolve his \ncredit card debts. He plans to start paying the debts starting with the lowest balances \nfirst. \nApplicant attached to his Answer to the SOR an email from a credit repair \ncompany showing a payment that Applicant made to a creditor. \nThe following delinquent debts set forth in the SOR are of security concern: \n1.a. A delinquent debt is owed to a creditor for an account that was placed for collection \nin the approximate amount of $8,998. The debt remains owing. \n1.b. A delinquent debt is owed to a creditor for an account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $6,514.

A delinquent debt is owed to a creditor for an account that was charged off in the \napproximate amount of $387. The debt remains owing. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and   \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nDue to a drastic salary reduction at work, Applicant could not afford to pay his \nbills and support his family at the same time. His wife also lost her job. He incurred \ndelinquent debt he could not afford to pay. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20; \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nand    \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nCircumstances largely beyond Applicant\u2019s control initially caused his financial \nproblem, namely his unexpected 55 percent salary reduction at work. As a result, he \nwas forced to quit the job and move to obtain new employment in order to support his \nfamily. His wife also lost her job about the same time. However, since October 2017, \nhe has been employed full time. He gives no reasonable excuse why his excessive \nindebtedness still exists when he has been employed on a full-time basis since October \n2017, over five and half years. While Applicant claims that he has started working with \na credit repair company and is making payments towards resolving his debts, he has \nsubmitted little documentary evidence to support this claim. From the limited evidence \npresented, his debts remain delinquent and owing. Applicant\u2019s inaction for so long \nreflects a pattern of unreliability, untrustworthiness, and poor judgment. Accordingly, \nApplicant does not meet the requirements to access classified information. \nThere is nothing in the record to demonstrate that Applicant has made efforts to \nmitigate the Government\u2019s concerns under Guideline F.

The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nWhile Applicant claims that he is making payments towards his debts, (with the \nexception of an email from the credit repair company showing a payment he made in \nthe amount of $213.66 to a creditor not listed in the SOR), he has submitted no other \ndocumentary evidence to support his claims. I considered the potentially disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions in light of all relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this \ncase. I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the Financial Considerations security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.k. \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admits to all allegations in the SOR. Applicant is a 26-year-old employee of a DOD contractor who seeks a security clearance. This is his first time applying for a security clearance. He has been employed with his current employer, Employer A, since September 2021. He also interned for Employer A while in college from June 2020 to December 2020. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2021. He is single and has no children. (GE 1, Tr. 15-17; AE F) (Note: The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment, names of witnesses, or locations in order to protect Applicant\u2019s and his family\u2019s privacy. The cited sources contain more specific information.) 2 Personal Conduct Under the Personal Conduct security concern, the SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s offer of employment was rescinded from Employer B because he failed a drug test. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) Applicant admits this allegation. In May 2021, Applicant received a job offer from Employer B. His employment was contingent upon Employer B\u2019s pre-employment screening to include drug testing. Applicant passed his first drug test, which he provided in May 2021. Due to an administrative error, he was required to take a second drug test in June 2021. Applicant used marijuana between the first and second drug test. He failed the second drug test. On August 4, 2021, Employer B rescinded the offer of employment because he failed to successfully pass the drug screen. (Tr. 20-21, 39-41; GE 3) ",

(Tr 38) \n2.b You used marijuana daily from approximately 2018 until at least May \n2021. (Tr. 33) \nThere was no objection to the amended allegation SOR \u00b6 1.c. However, \nApplicant\u2019s counsel objected to the amended allegation SOR \u00b6 2.b because of the short \nnotice given this new allegation. He was not prepared to present evidence on this issue. \nI advised the parties that I intended to keep the record open one month to allow \nApplicant\u2019s counsel to present new evidence regarding the new allegation. Applicant\u2019s \ncounsel mentioned the possibility of Applicant undergoing an assessment pertaining to \nsubstance abuse. Department Counsel objected to this assessment, because they \nwould not have the opportunity to cross-examine the expert who will make the \nassessment. I advised Department Counsel if Applicant submits a substance abuse \nassessment, they have an opportunity to review the assessment and can request to \nreopen the proceedings to allow them the opportunity to cross-examine the expert. (Tr. \n33-37) Both amendments were granted, subject to the conditions in the above \nparagraph. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admits to all allegations in the SOR. \nApplicant is a 26-year-old employee of a DOD contractor who seeks a security \nclearance. This is his first time applying for a security clearance. He has been employed \nwith his current employer, Employer A, since September 2021. He also interned for \nEmployer A while in college from June 2020 to December 2020. He earned a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in May 2021. He is single and has no children. (GE 1, Tr. 15-17; AE F) \n(Note: The facts in this decision do not specifically describe employment, names \nof witnesses, or locations in order to protect Applicant\u2019s and his family\u2019s privacy.

(SOR \u00b6 \n1.a) Applicant admits this allegation. In May 2021, Applicant received a job offer from \nEmployer B. His employment was contingent upon Employer B\u2019s pre-employment \nscreening to include drug testing. Applicant passed his first drug test, which he provided \nin May 2021.  Due to an administrative error, he was required to take a second drug test \nin June 2021. Applicant used marijuana between the first and second drug test. He \nfailed the second drug test. On August 4, 2021, Employer B rescinded the offer of \nemployment because he failed to successfully pass the drug screen. (Tr. 20-21, 39-41; \nGE 3)   \nThe SOR also alleged Applicant falsified material facts during a February 28, \n2022, interview with an authorized investigator for the United States Office of Personnel \nManagement, by answering \u201cNo\u201d when asked about whether he used illegal drugs \nwithin the last seven years. He denied any illegal drug use, even though he had failed a \ndrug test in 2021, and smoked marijuana on a regular basis while in college. He lied \nbecause he thought he would lose another job if he admitted that he used illegal drugs. \nHe wanted to protect his job. (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Tr. 24-25; GE 2 at 7) \nAs stated above, the SOR also alleged Applicant deliberately falsified material \nfacts on a security clearance application, dated June 2, 2021, when he answered \u201cNo\u201d \nin response to \u201cSection 23 \u2013 Illegal Use of Drugs and Drug Activity \u2013 Illegal Use of \nDrugs or Controlled Substances \u2013 \u201cIn the last seven years, have you illegally used any \ndrugs or controlled substances? Use of a drug or controlled substance includes \ninjecting, snorting, inhaling, swallowing, experimenting with or otherwise consuming any \ndrug or controlled substance.\u201d Applicant failed to list his marijuana use from 2018 to \nMay 2021. (SOR \u00b6 1.c: Tr. 31-32; GE 1 at 32-33) \nAfter Employer B rescinded Applicant\u2019s job offer, he re-applied for a position with \nEmployer A. Employer A offered him a position which he accepted. He completed the \ne-QIP in June 2021, and he passed a drug test in August 2021. He started work at \nEmployer A in September 2021. (Tr. 17, 20-23; GE 1; GE 3) \nApplicant started using marijuana in high school. He began using marijuana \nalmost every day starting his sophomore year in college. He no longer socializes with \nthe people he used marijuana with while in college. None of his personal friends use \nmarijuana. He took and passed two drug tests in October 2022 and July 2023. (AE C \nand AE I) The last time he used marijuana was in May 2021. He has no intention to use \nmarijuana in the future. On October 17, 2022, Applicant signed an affidavit declaring his \nintent to refrain from illegal drug use and acknowledging any future use of illegal drugs \nwill result in the revocation of his security clearance. (Tr. 25 \u2013 29; AE B; AE C; AE I) \nThe use of marijuana is legal in the state where Applicant resides. Applicant was \naware that it remained illegal under federal law. He also admitted that he deliberately \nfailed to disclose his illegal marijuana use on his June 2021 security clearance \napplication because he wanted to hide it.

Based on his testimony, Department Counsel \nmotioned to amend the SOR in accordance with paragraph \u00b6 E3.1.1.17 of the Directive \nas discussed in the Procedural Section above. (SOR \u00b6 1.c: GE 1 at 31-32; Tr. 30-32) \nDrug Involvement \nUnder the drug involvement security concern, the SOR alleged Applicant failed a \nurinalysis test in or about August 2021. (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Gov 3) Applicant admits this \nallegation. However, it is likely Applicant submitted his urine sample in May or June \n2021. He was notified by Employer B that their employment offer was rescinded in early \nAugust 2021. \nOn August 12, 2023, Dr. E., Ph.D., ABPP, a board-certified psychologist \nevaluated Applicant. The purpose of the evaluation was to determine whether Applicant \nhad a substance use condition, personality patterns, or behavioral propensities that \ncould negatively impact his reliability, trustworthiness or judgment. Applicant provided \nthe information about the issues with his security clearance to Dr. E. Upon reviewing the \ndocuments, interviewing Applicant, and conducting several tests, Dr. E. concluded \nApplicant does not exhibit signs or symptoms of a substance use disorder at the present \ntime, and it is unlikely he has ever met criteria for such a condition in the past. He notes \nthat while Applicant\u2019s marijuana use in college was unhealthy and ill-advised, it is not \nunusual for college students to use marijuana. Studies have shown up to 44% of \ncollege-aged adults use marijuana. He notes Applicant last used marijuana in 2021, and \nhe has no desire to use marijuana in the future. He also notes that the risk for future \nmarijuana use by Applicant is extremely low. Applicant\u2019s prognosis for continued \npsychological wellness is excellent. (AE L) \nOn September 5, 2023, Applicant provided another urinalysis sample. His \nsample tested negative for illegal drugs to include marijuana.  (AE M) \nWhole-Person Factors \nApplicant submitted several character letters. Mr. T., his former supervisor \nrecommends him for a security clearance. He describes Applicant as a highly \nprofessional, trustworthy individual. He supervised him for over one and half years. He \nobserved Applicant being respectful and mindful of security policies and restrictions. He \nhas always trusted Applicant and has had no reason to doubt or question him. He finds \nhim worthy of having his security clearance reinstated so that he can continue in his \npromising career. (AE H; AE J) \nMs. B. has known Applicant for 21 years. She describes him as a person of high \nmoral character, consistently demonstrating trustworthiness, honesty, and respect. He \nhas constantly demonstrated \u201cunwavering loyalty, kindness and support\u201d to her family. \n(AE J) \nMs. L. has known Applicant since he was 13 years old.

She says, \u201cHe is smart, and he is a good man, with good values, and \na good head on his shoulders.\u201d She is comfortable with him having a security clearance. \n(AE J) \nTwo other co-workers provided letters on Applicant\u2019s behalf. They both describe \nhis excellent work ethic and integrity. They have no doubt that he is committed to \nupholding the security of the country. (AE J) His fellow employees at Employer A think \nhighly of him. \nApplicant has received several spot awards recognizing his positive contributions \nto Employer A. He was recognized for his collaboration and accountability. (AE E) In \nJuly 2023, he received an Achievement Award for his excellent duty performance. (AE \nN) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nDOD and Federal Government Policy on Marijuana Use \nOn October 25, 2014, the Director for National Intelligence, issued a \nmemorandum titled, \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use,\u201d \naddressing concerns raised by the decriminalization of marijuana use in several states \nand the District of Columbia. The memorandum states that changes to state and local \nlaws do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative Guidelines. \u201cAn individual\u2019s \ndisregard for federal law pertaining the use, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains \nadjudicatively relevant in national security determinations.\u201d \nOn May 26, 2015, the Director of the United States Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) issued a memorandum titled, \u201cFederal Laws and Policies \nProhibiting Marijuana Use.\u201d The Director of OPM acknowledged that several \njurisdictions have decriminalized the use of marijuana, allowing the use of marijuana for \nmedicinal purposes and/or for limited recreational use, but states that Federal law on \nmarijuana remains unchanged. Marijuana is categorized as a controlled substance \nunder Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. Thus, knowing or intentional \nmarijuana possession is illegal, even if the individual has no intent to manufacture, \ndistribute, or dispense marijuana. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement is set out in \nAG & 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of  \nprescription drug and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other \nsubstances that cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a \nmanner inconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find the following drug involvement disqualifying conditions apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case. \nAG \u00b6 25(a) any substance misuse;  \nAG \u00b6 25(b) testing positive for an illegal drug; and \nAG \u00b6 25(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia.  \nThe amended SOR alleges and Applicant admits he used marijuana from 2018 \nto May 2021. Most of his use occurred while he was in college. Marijuana use is legal in \nthe state where he resides, however, he is aware that marijuana use remains illegal \nunder federal law. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that Applicant used and \npossessed marijuana. AG \u00b6 25(a) and AG \u00b6 25(c) apply. \nApplicant tested positive for marijuana during a pre-employment drug test for \nCompany B. AG \u00b6 25(b) applies. \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence and Applicant\u2019s own admissions raise \nsecurity concerns under Guideline H, Drug Involvement. The burden shifted to Applicant \nto produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. \n(Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and \nthe burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02\u00ad\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. September 22, 2005)) \nGuideline H also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from drug involvement. The following mitigating conditions potentially \napply to the Applicant\u2019s case: \nAG \u00b6 26(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \nAG \u00b6 26(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 26(a) applies because Applicant stopped using Marijuana in May 2021. His \npositive pre-employment drug test for Company B \u201cscared him straight.\u201d More than two \nand a half years have passed since Applicant\u2019s last involvement with marijuana. While \nApplicant\u2019s illegal use of marijuana raises questions about his judgment, his use \noccurred primarily in college, and he learned the hard way that it was time for him to \nfollow the law. \nAG \u00b6 26(b) applies because Applicant acknowledged his illegal drug use and \nsigned a statement of intent indicating he will not use marijuana in the future. He \nacknowledged any future illegal use could result in the revocation of his security \nclearance. He testified that he no longer associates with his college friends with whom \nhe used marijuana. \nOverall, Applicant met his burden to mitigate the security concerns raised under \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during the national \nsecurity or adjudicative processes. . . . \nThe following disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 16 potentially apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case: \nAG \u00b6 16(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history \nstatement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine \nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine national \nsecurity eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \nAG \u00b6 16(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or \nconcealing or omitting information concerning relevant facts to an \nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical or mental \nhealth professional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a \nnational security eligibility determination, or other official government \nrepresentative;  \nAG \u00b6 16(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered \nunder any other guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an \nadverse determination, but which, when combined with all available \ninformation, supports a whole-person assessment of questionable \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations, or characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: deliberately providing \nfalse or misleading information; or concealing or omitting information \nconcerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, \ncompetent medical or mental health professional involved in making a \nrecommendation relevant to a national security eligibility determination, or \nother official government representative: (3) a pattern of dishonesty and \nrule violations; and \nAG \u00b6 16(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the \nindividual to the employer as a condition of employment.  \nAG \u00b6 16(a) applies. Applicant admits that he deliberately omitted his illegal \nmarijuana use in response to Section 23 on his June 2021 security clearance \napplication. He omitted his marijuana use out of fear he would lose his job. \nAG \u00b6 16(b) applies. Applicant deliberately lied to the investigator conducting his \nbackground investigation in February 2022, when he denied using illegal drugs within \nthe past seven years, when he had, in fact, used marijuana on a regular basis from \n2018 to May 2021. This response is aggravated by the fact that Applicant was aware at \nthe time that he lost the job offer with Employer B in August 2021 because of his \npositive drug test. Applicant admits he lied because he was worried about getting a \nsecurity clearance and the potential for losing his job with Employer A. \nAG \u00b6 16(d) applies with regards to Applicant\u2019s pattern of dishonesty throughout \nthe security clearance process regarding his illegal marijuana use. His lack of candor \nraises questions about his judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. \nAG \u00b6 16(f) applies pertaining to his positive drug test, which resulted in Employer \nB rescinding the offer of employment because a clean drug test was a pre-condition of \nhis employment. \nUnder Guideline E, the following mitigating conditions potentially apply in \nApplicant\u2019s case: \nAG \u00b6 17(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; \nAG \u00b6 17(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the\nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nalleviate the stressors, circumstances,or factors that contributed to \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such \nbehavior is unlikely to recur; and \nAG \u00b6 17(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nAG \u00b6 17(a) does not apply. Applicant withheld his deliberate omission of illegal \nmarijuana use until after the SOR was issued. While credit is given to Applicant for fully \ndisclosing the extent of his illegal marijuana use during the hearing, his disclosure \ncannot be considered prompt. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply. Applicant deliberately lied to the federal government \non several occasions about his illegal drug use during the security clearance process. \nWhile he fully disclosed his illegal marijuana use during the hearing, he admitted he lied \npreviously because he was afraid he would not be granted a security clearance and \nlose his job. While Applicant eventually provided full disclosure, his numerous deliberate \nfalsifications still raise questions about his trustworthiness and judgment. \nAG \u00b6 17(d) partially applies. Applicant fully disclosed the extent of his illegal \nmarijuana use during the hearing. I found him cooperative. He was assessed by a \nlicensed psychologist who found no substance abuse issues. However, this mitigating \ncondition is given less weight because of the extent of Applicant\u2019s false statements. \nWhile Applicant has made steps to fully disclose his illegal drug use to the federal \ngovernment, his deliberate falsifications during the security clearance process created \ndoubt about his judgment and truthfulness. The federal government expects security \nclearance holders and applicants for a security clearance to be truthful with the \ngovernment at all times. Deliberate falsifications during the security clearance process \nare serious violations of the government\u2019s trust and raise doubts about Applicant\u2019s \nability to work with and protect classified information. Personal Conduct security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n10 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n           I considered Applicant\u2019s performance awards and favorable character \nreferences. I considered he ultimately disclosed his illegal marijuana use during the \nhearing and expressed remorse for his past conduct. I considered that he learned a \ndifficult lesson after his positive marijuana test in 2021 and stopped using marijuana in \nMay 2021. I find Applicant mitigated the security concerns under Guideline H because it \nhas been more than two and half years since he last used marijuana and he signed a \nstatement of intent to no longer use illegal drugs in the future.  \n \n          \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nUnder Personal Conduct, a security concern remains about Applicant\u2019s deliberate \nlies about his illegal marijuana use during the security clearance process. He \ndeliberately lied about his illegal marijuana use on his June 2021 security clearance \napplication and during his February 2022 background investigation interview. Questions \nabout Applicant\u2019s truthfulness remain. The security concerns under Personal Conduct \nare not mitigated. \nFor the reasons stated above, I cannot grant Applicant a security clearance at \nthis time. If he continues to progress, remains truthful, and continues to abstain from \nillegal drug use, he is likely to be granted a security clearance at some point in the \nfuture. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions as well as the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. The security concerns under Personal \nConduct are not mitigated. The security concerns under Drug Involvement are \nmitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \nSOR, as required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a \u2013 2.b: \nFor Applicant \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Miller, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n05/01/2023 \nDecision \nRICCIARDELLO, Carol G., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant failed to mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn August 19, 2022, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline F, financial \nconsiderations. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the \nDOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 19, 2022, and elected to have his case \ndecided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), and Applicant received it on November \n25, 2022. He was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM.

Applicant \ndid not submit a response to the FORM or object to the Government\u2019s evidence. Items 2-\n7 are admitted into evidence. The case was assigned to me on January 27, 2023.\n \n \n \n \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.r except for 1.k, which he \ndenied. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and \ncareful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of \nfact. \nApplicant is 42 years old. He married in 2021 and has no children. He attended \ntechnical college from June 2002 to May 2006 and earned an associate\u2019s degree. He also \nattended another college from August 2004 to May 2009 and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree. \nHe then attended college from August 2010 to May 2011 but did not earn a degree. He \nis being sponsored for a security clearance, but apparently, he is not yet employed by his \nsponsor, a defense contractor. \nApplicant attributed his financial hardship to work being slow and he was unable \nto find a job. He disclosed periods of unemployment from August 2010 to September \n2011, January 2012 to May 2012, August 2012 to February 2013, and April 2020 to May \n2021. He also reported he experienced underemployment. He stated in his SOR answer \nthat when he graduated from college in 2009, he was overwhelmed by the magnitude of \nhis student loans. He hoped to get a good job and begin paying them within six months. \nHe was unable to get a job commensurate with his degree and had to accept lower-paying \nemployment to pay his expenses. He further stated that he attempted to rectify his \nfinancial difficulties with loans but was unable to pay any \u201cup-front payments required by \nthe agencies on an exact date given.\u201d (Item 2) \nApplicant also stated in his SOR answer that he has a hearing disability that makes \nit challenging to rectify his financial issues over the phone. He said, \u201cI have taken the \nnecessary steps with the granting agencies in a good-faith effort to repay if current debt \ncould be restructured based on current income, resolve some of the debt in full, and/or to \nmake restitution with set monthly payments.\u201d (Item 2) He did not provide documents to \nshow what specific agreements or steps he has taken toward a particular debt. He also \nhoped to use future income tax refunds to satisfy his debts. (Items 2, 3, 4) \nThe SOR alleged 14 delinquent debts totaling approximately $114,000 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a through 1.n), additional allegations for failure to pay federal income taxes for tax years \n2017, 2018, and 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.o - $8,892), and failure to pay state income taxes for tax \nyears 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.p - $4,521). The SOR also alleged Applicant \nfailed to timely file his 2017 and 2018 federal income tax returns and his 2017 state \nincome tax return (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.q-1.r). \nApplicant\u2019s SOR admissions, SOR answer, statements made to the government \ninvestigator that were affirmed in his interrogatories, tax transcripts, and credit reports \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfrom July 2021, February 2022, and July 2022 corroborate the SOR allegations. (Items \n2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR regarding the allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.f, 1.g, 1.h, \n1.j, 1.l, 1.m, 1.n, 1.o, and 1.p, he states that he will pay the debts or enter into a settlement \nagreement if he is able to attain a security clearance and employment. These debts are \nunresolved. \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR regarding the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e, \nhis delinquent student loans (approximately $99,875), he provided a copy of \ncorrespondence with the Department of Education from July 2022 indicating his student \nloans were in forbearance under the CARES Act and were not currently being collected. \nHis loans were delinquent prior to the CARES Act. During his August 2021 interview with \na government investigator, which he affirmed its accuracy in his July 2022 interrogatories, \nApplicant said that he got behind on paying his loans in August 2017, and he could not \nafford payments. He said he experienced financial hardship at that time and then later \nduring the pandemic. No evidence was provided regarding any payments he made on the \nstudent loans or attempts to address them prior to the forbearance. He stated in his SOR \nAnswer that he has submitted a loan rehabilitation income and expense form to the \ncreditor so he can get an affordable monthly payment plan. This will not be acted upon \nuntil the CARES Act expires. He is also requesting a $10,000 to $20,000 loan forgiveness \nto be credited to the balance he owes. (Item 4) \nApplicant admitted that he owed the IRS approximately $8,892 for delinquent taxes \nfor tax years 2017, 2018, and 2019. In his SOR answer he stated: \u201cPayment has been \nstopped until income is acceptable to satisfy debt owed. If I attain this clearance and job \nI will be able to agree to a settlement to satisfy debt.\u201d (Item 2) He did not provide evidence \nthat he made any payments. He provided a document from the IRS that stated he had \nvisited the IRS Taxpayer Assistance Center in his home state. The letter references tax \nyear 2019 and states: \u201c[Applicant] has come into the Taxpayer Assistance Center to get \na letter that says he is in Currently Not Collectable status. This letter is to show that he is \nindeed currently not collectable for 2019.\u201d No other information was provided regarding \npayment of his federal tax debt. (Item 2) \nIn response to government interrogatories, Applicant stated he had filed his 2017 \nand 2018 federal income tax returns in July 2020. He disclosed that he owed federal \nincome tax for tax years 2017, 2018, and 2019. He provided copies of federal income tax \nreturn forms for 2017 and 2018, but they were not signed and there is no proof they were \nmailed and accepted. IRS account transcripts from July 2022 reflect the 2017 and 2018 \ntax returns had not been filed. (Items 2, 4) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to pay his 2015, 2017, 2018, and 2019 state \nincome taxes. It also alleged that he failed to timely file his 2017 state income tax return. \nApplicant indicated in his response to interrogatories that he filed his 2015, 2017, 2018 \nstate tax returns in January 2021. State tax forms he provided are unsigned and there is \nno proof that he mailed or filed his 2017 return electronically. A letter included in his \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nanswer to the SOR from his state department of revenue from July 2016 shows Applicant \nwas assessed $45 for tax period 2015. There is no proof it was paid. Another letter from \nJanuary 2021 to Applicant in bold letters and capitalized says \u201cREMINDER-WE HAVE \nNOT RECEIVED YOUR TAX RETURN.\u201d It also states that he owes $1,050 for tax year \n2017. Letters for tax years 2018 and 2019 show tax debts of $1,711 and $1,519, \nrespectively. Applicant did not provide evidence that he paid these taxes. (Item 2) \nApplicant provided no explanation for his failure to timely file his federal and state \nincome tax returns. Transcripts show his total federal tax balance is $8,892. It is unknown \nhow the \u201ccurrently not collectable\u201d status for his 2019 taxes is viewed, as it appears the \namount owed for that year ($3,810) is included in the total balance. Although 2019 taxes \nmay not currently be collectible, it does not mean it was not owed or will not be collected \nin the future. (Items 2, 4) \nApplicant denied owing the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.k ($719) claiming he never signed a \ncontract with the creditor, and that he has contacted the creditor and collection company \nnumerous times. The debt is not listed on his most recent credit report and is resolved in \nhis favor. \nRegarding the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($1,187), Applicant admitted owing the debt and \nmerely states it was charged off and should be removed from his credit report. It is \nunresolved. For the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($56) and 1.i ($454), he admitted the debts and \nnoted the collection accounts were charged off and will not be reopened for payment. No \nevidence was provided to show he resolved these debts. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \n4 \n\n \n \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \n5 \n\n \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has approximately $15,198 of delinquent consumer debt and $99,875 of \nstudent loan debt that is presently in forbearance but was delinquent prior to the CARES \nAct moratorium on student loans. He owes $8,892 for delinquent federal income taxes \nand approximately $4,325 for delinquent state income taxes. In addition, he failed to \ntimely file his 2017 and 2018 federal income tax returns and his 2017 state income tax \nreturn. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe persons control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant did not provide evidence that he has paid or attempted to pay any of his \ndelinquent debts. He began having financial difficulties in 2017 due to underemployment \nand unemployment. He did not provide an explanation for why he failed to timely file his \nfederal income tax returns for 2017 and 2018, nor did he provide proof that they are now \nfiled. He failed to provide proof that his 2017 state income tax return is filed. Applicant \nfailed to provide evidence of any actions he may have taken at the time to make payment \narrangements with the IRS or his state tax authority. Although, his student loans are in \nforbearance due to the CARES Act, they were in delinquent status before then, and he \nsaid he has been unable to pay them since 2017. Applicant\u2019s plan to resolve most of his \ndebts is contingent upon attaining a security clearance for a job he has been offered but \nnot yet started. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply because Applicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing, \nunresolved, and there is insufficient evidence they are unlikely to recur. His \nunemployment and underemployment may have been beyond his control. For the full \napplication of AG \u00b6 20(b) Applicant must have acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Applicant provided minimal evidence regarding actions he has taken to \nresolve any of his delinquent debts. There is no evidence he has received financial \ncounseling or has made a good-faith effort to resolve his debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), 20(d), and \n20(g) do not apply. I have given Applicant credit regarding the debt he disputed (SOR \u00b6 \n1.k) and find AG \u00b6 20(e) applies to that debt. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n7 \n\n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nIn ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis omitted, the \nDOHA Appeal Board has commented: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established government rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with these things is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). \nSomeone who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal obligations does not \ndemonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability required of \nthose granted access to classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. August 18, 2015). See Cafeteria & Restaurant \nWorkers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, 183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), \naff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). ISCR Case No. 12-10933 at 3 (App. Bd. June \n29, 2016). \nApplicant has not met his burden of persuasion. He does not have a reliable \nfinancial track record of paying his debts and filing and paying his federal and state \nincome tax returns and taxes. The record evidence leaves me with serious questions and \ndoubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under \nGuideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.l-1.r: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCarol G. Ricciardello \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

He \nsaid in the interview summary that as a result, his clearance was suspended for one \nyear, and was reinstated in March 2021. (Item 4 at 10) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges (and SOR \u00b6 2.a cross-alleges) that Applicant \u201csolicited escorts \nfor sexual services with varying frequency from approximately 2012 to at least 2020.\u201d In \nhis SOR response, Applicant crossed out the words \u201cat least\u201d and wrote: \nI admit to the Statement of Reasons as Amended with the retraction of the \nphrase \u2018at least.\u201d Since the revocation of my clearance in March 2020, I \nhave discontinued the solicitation of escorts for sexual services as \npromised in a previous telephone conversation. I will not further engage in \nsaid illegal activities. (Item 2) \nApplicant did not elaborate. He did not submit any other statement or evidence with his \nanswer to the SOR and he did not respond to the Government\u2019s FORM, so he provided \nno additional information in mitigation. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has noted, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline D: Sexual Behavior \nAG \u00b6 12 expresses the security concern for sexual conduct: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of \njudgment or discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, \nmay \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual's \njudgment, \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \nSexual behavior includes conduct occurring in person or via audio, visual, \nelectronic, or written transmission. No adverse inference concerning the \nstandards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the basis of the sexual \norientation of the individual. \nAG \u00b6 13 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are applicable to Applicant\u2019s \nadmitted conduct: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of discretion or \njudgment. \nAG \u00b6 14 sets forth the potentially applicable mitigating conditions for sexual \nconduct: \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \nand \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress. \nApplicant\u2019s actions which occurred while he held a security clearance and while \nworking in the defense industry, put him in a position where he might have been subject \nto coercion, exploitation, or duress. He disclosed his engagement with escorts during a \npre-polygraph interview, on his most recent SCA, and in the subsequent background \ninterview. He also says he disclosed the matter to his wife. AG \u00b6 14(c) applies. \nHowever, the extended nature of his activity as well as its relative recency weighs \nagainst application of AG \u00b6 14(b). The fact that he held a security clearance, while not a \ndisqualifying factor, further weighs against mitigation. I cannot conclude that Applicant\u2019s \nactions happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such unusual circumstances, \nand no longer cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. AG \u00b6 \n14(b) does not apply. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 details the security concern regarding personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . .  \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information;  \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing; and  \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity. \nSOR \u00b6 2.a is a cross-allegation of Applicant\u2019s conduct under Guideline D, \ndiscussed above. SOR \u00b6 1.a is \u201csufficient for an adverse determination,\u201d under \nGuideline D, so AG \u00b6 16(c) does not apply to it. However, engaging the services of \nprostitutes satisfies both AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(e)(1) and 16(g). It also satisfies the general personal \nconduct security concern of AG \u00b6 15 due to Applicant\u2019s repeated instances of poor \njudgment and failures to comply with rules and regulations that are clearly established. \nAG \u00b6 17 details the personal conduct mitigating conditions. The following warrant \ndiscussion: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur;  \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activities was unwitting, \nhas ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply to Applicant\u2019s engagement with escorts under \nGuideline E for the same reasons AG \u00b6 14(b) does not apply under Guideline D. \nSimilarly, AG \u00b6 17(e) applies for the same reasons as set forth in AG \u00b6 14(c). \nApplicant has not established that AG \u00b6 17(d) should fully apply. While he has \nacknowledged the behavior and represented that he has ceased it, he did so in a \nblanket statement in his SOR response, without any corroborating or supporting \nevidence. He has not indicated that he has participated in counseling regarding his \nbehavior, or that circumstances have otherwise changed. As with AG \u00b6 17(c), it also \ndoes not fully apply because he did not provide sufficient evidence to establish that his \nconduct will not recur. \nAG \u00b6 17(f) does not apply. Applicant did not establish that the information was \nunsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability. \nAG \u00b6 17(g) applies because Applicant\u2019s engagement with prostitutes has ceased. \nIt was not unwitting, however, and, as addressed above, his actions occurred under \ncircumstances that cast doubt upon his reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or \nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines D and E in my whole-person analysis.

I also had no \nopportunity to observe Applicant\u2019s demeanor, and thus, to assess his credibility. \nApplicant has engaged in a pattern of extremely poor judgment and did so while in \npossession of a security clearance. He did not provide sufficient evidence to establish \nthat he has mitigated the security concerns in this case. He has not shown that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline D: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2: Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant access to classified information. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nBraden M.

He stated that he was \nstill attempting to find an accountant to prepare and file his income tax returns. He \nhoped to have all the returns filed by the end of 2022. (GE 2) \nTax returns for truck drivers can be complicated and tedious. Applicant and his \nwife had a difficult time finding an accountant or tax preparer who had the requisite \nexpertise and was willing to work on their returns. They retained a tax professional in \nJuly 2022, but their tax returns are challenging. He submitted copies of spreadsheets \nshowing expenses for fuel, food, and lodging. It was the tax professional who informed \nApplicant that he owed taxes for 2013. Applicant\u2019s wife testified that she believed that at \nleast some of the back returns had been filed. She was mistaken. The returns have not \nyet been filed. (Tr. at 14-21; 29-31, 35-38; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 3; AE A) \nThe tax professional wrote in July 2023: \nDue to the amount of time it requires to accurately report and file their \ntaxes it is taking our firm longer than expected to complete them.

He did not always pay the full amount owed.

His child is 19 \nyears old and not in high school or college, so the payment for child support should \ncease, and all of the payments will go toward the arrearages. He asserted that he is \ncommitted to filing the back tax returns, paying whatever taxes are owed, and \ncontinuing to pay his child support. (Tr. at 26-28, 57-58; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; \nAE C) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, including unpaid taxes, unfiled tax \nreturns, and child support arrearages. The above disqualifying conditions are \napplicable. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant did not realize he owed taxes for 2013 until his new tax professional \ninformed him. Since that time, he has paid the balance, which was as high as $5,529. \nHis unpaid taxes for 2013 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) are mitigated. \nApplicant paid some child support, just not always the required amount, and not \nenough to lower the arrearages. His child is 19 years old and not in high school or \ncollege, so the payments for child support should cease, at which time all of the \npayments will go toward the arrearages. His child support arrearages (SOR \u00b6 1.c) are in \nthe process of being resolved and are mitigated. \nThe greatest concern in this case are the unfiled returns. Failure to comply with \ntax laws suggests that an applicant has a problem with abiding by well-established \ngovernment rules and systems. Voluntary compliance with rules and systems is \nessential for protecting classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-01726 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2018). A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her legal \nobligations, such as filing tax returns and paying taxes when due, does not demonstrate \nthe high degree of good judgment and reliability required of those granted access to \nclassified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, \n2018). \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nThis is not a case where the returns went unfiled, but the taxes were paid by \nwithholding from pay. IRS account transcripts for 2017 through 2019 and 2022 do not \nreport any funds withheld from pay nor any other payments. Transcripts for 2020 and \n2021 were not submitted in evidence. Applicant\u2019s wife admitted that the last time they \npaid any federal income taxes was a \u201clong time ago.\u201d This begs the question if Applicant \nthought his income tax returns were being filed, why did he never inquire about whether \nhe owed taxes. Applicant was either grossly negligent or intentionally indifferent. I will \ngive him the benefit of the doubt and find him grossly negligent. \nI understand that Applicant and his wife spend much of their time on the road, \nand their accounting and income tax returns are challenging because they have to \naccount for every dollar spent in fuel, food, and lodging. But that is their responsibility as \ntruck owners. Every truck owner on the road has the same challenges. The bottom line \nis that the returns have still not been filed, and nobody has any idea how much taxes he \nwill owe when they are filed. There are no mitigating conditions applicable to the unfiled \ntax returns (SOR \u00b6 1.a). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. There are few things more \nAmerican than being on the road and hauling freight in one\u2019s own truck. However, those \ntrucks run on fuel, and the U.S. Government runs on taxes. Applicant shirked his \nresponsibility to ensure that his tax returns were filed, and any taxes owed were paid. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nFor Applicant  \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and six \nexhibits (AEs A-F). The transcript (Tr.) was received on June 14, 2023. \nProcedural Issues \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the record be kept open to \npermit him the opportunity to supplement the record with additional awards. For good \ncause shown, he was granted seven days to supplement the record. Department \nCounsel was afforded two days to respond. \nWithin the time permitted, Applicant supplemented the record with achievement \nawards he received between 2007 and 2012.

Allegedly, these debts have not been resolved and remain \noutstanding. \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he admitted testing positive for marijuana in \nJune 2021 while holding. a security clearance. However, he denied his using marijuana \nprior to his positive test. He added explanations and clarifications. He claimed he used a \nCBD product sold in local stores to facilitate relief from his aches and pains associated \nwith his disabilities. He acknowledged his mistake to place his trust in a product he did \nnot know anything about and claimed he has since ceased using THC-enhanced drugs. \nAddressing this delinquent debt allegations, Applicant claimed that he is paying \nhis listed delinquent accounts that became delinquent during a period of post-military \nretirement financial difficulties.

(GE \n1; Tr. 23) He has one child (age 14) from his latest marriage. \nApplicant has taken classes from a local university since 2019, about has not \nearned a degree or diploma. (GE 1) He enlisted in in the Army in March 1996 and \nserved almost 20 years of active duty before receiving an Army medical discharge in \nJuly 2016 with a cited 345% disability. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 23, 28) \nSince September 2021, Applicant has been employed by his current defense \ncontractor as a field service representative. (GE 1) Previously, he worked for other \nemployers in various jobs. (GE 1) He reported unemployment between August 2016 \nand September 2019. (GEs 1-3) Applicant held a security clearance throughout his \nArmy enlistment, as well as with his previous employer before his termination in June \n2021 for cited reasons of testing positive for marijuana. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 23) Applicant \ncontinues to receive military disability pay and medical care from the Veterans \nAdministration (VA) to \u201cimprove my way of life.\u201d (Tr. 23) He is currently sponsored by his \nemployer for a security clearance. (GE 1; Tr. 29) \nApplicant\u2019s drug history \nDuring a routine, randomized drug screening in June 2021, Applicant tested \npositive for marijuana. (GE 5) Although the amount of THC in his system was not \nrecorded, enough THC was found to confirm a positive test for marijuana. As the result \nof his positive drug test, he was terminated from his employment. (GEs 1 and 6; Tr. 36) \nOnce Applicant learned of his positive drug test, he disposed of all of his cannabidiol \n(CBD oil). (Tr. 36) Prior to appearing for his scheduled randomized drug test in June \n2021, Applicant failed to notify either the Government or his employer that he was \ningesting CBD oil. (Tr. 28-30) Further, he did not list his taking CBD oil in the security \nclearance application he completed for his current employer. (Tr. 30) \nApplicant denied using marijuana prior to his positive drug test and claimed he \nhad tried a new product (CBD) oil recommended to him by a friend that he purchased in \na local store to help him achieve some relief from the aches and pains associated with \nhis disabilities. (Applicant\u2019s Response; Tr. 23-24) He claimed he did not know the CBD \noil was enhanced with THC, the main component of marijuana. And, for this reason he \ndid not list his use of CBD oil in his electronic questionnaire for investigations \nprocessing (e-QIP) he completed for his current employer. Nor did he notify his current \nemployer that he used CBD oil and was fired from his employer at the time as the result \nof his positive drug test. (GE 1; Tr. 30-31) Asked why he did not disclose his positive \ndrug test to his current employer, Applicant responded that \u201che didn\u2019t think it was \u201cgoing \nto be a big issue because he not smoked marijuana prior to his positive drug test.

(Applicant\u2019s response; Tr. 24, 30-31) He \nbased his entire denial of marijuana in his system when tested on his verbal assurances \nthat he has never used marijuana and has since ceased using any form of CBD oil. \n(Applicant\u2019s Response, Tr. 24) Asked about documented proof of his taking CBD oil \nlaced with THC, Applicant could not provide any product labels, correspondence, or \nother proof to verify his use of CBD oil prior to testing positive for marijuana in his \nsystem. (Tr. 30) Nor could he furnish any documentation of his claimed pre-test \nnotification to his employer at the time of his pre-test use of CBD oil in 2016. (Tr. 30-31) \nWhether the VA would have prescribed CBD oil to Applicant is unclear and really \ndependent upon the levels of THP in the product to be prescribed. \nWhile THC is a chemical element typically found in both CBD-sourced hemp \nplants and marijuana plants, Applicant could furnish no evidence the oil used was \nproven to contain THC at levels that could be mistaken for marijuana in a randomized \ndrug test. (Tr. 32-35). Although traces of THC have been found in studies of CBD oil, \nresearch supporting the drug\u2019s benefits in treating these conditions is still limited. See \nMayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (2023) \nWhen the concentration of THC in tested urine exceeds 50 ng/mL, most tests will \nyield a positive result according to data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention. See https//www.cdc.gov. Currently, the THC content in tested \nmarijuana typically exceeds 13 per cent. See https.//www.urm.rochester.edu. By \ncontrast, THC levels in CBD oils are advertised to contain no THC and typically contain \nno THC, or very small traces (no more than 0.3 percent). See L. Hellicar, Does \ncannabidiol (CBDZ) Contain THC? in https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/does-\ncbd-have-thc. Still, studies caution that in some lower-grade CBD products (depending \non the source of the marketed CBD oil), tested CBD products can contain sufficiently \nhigh levels of THC to result in a positive marijuana test under random drug testing \nprograms. See id. \nAsked to identify the specific CBD oil product he was taking, Applicant could not \n(a) identify the type of CBD product he used, (b) document the labels of the product, or \n(c) supply any other evidence to refute the positive results for marijuana reported in the \ntest results of his June 2021 test (Tr. 32) Because of the risk that CBD products can \npotentially contain varying amounts of THC that exceed the federally and state-\nmandated maximum THC percent levels for public marketing (i.e., 0.3 per cent), \nindividuals are generally advised to check the labels of the CDC products they purchase \nin retail stores licensed to sell CBD products. See Mayo Foundation for Medical \nEducation and Research, supra. (GE 5) \nBased on the evidence produced, interpretation of the test results associated \nwith Applicant\u2019s June 2021 positive drug test leaves only two plausible explanations: \nEither the marijuana tested was marijuana as reported that exceeds recognized cut-off \nlevels for marijuana or related products (inclusive of CBD oil), or the product tested \ncontained THC amounts that exceeded accepted federal and state approval levels of \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n             \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTHC content (i.e., 0.3 per cent).

(GEs 2-4; Tr. 25) Credit reports document that he defaulted in \nhis monthly payments on these two accounts in June 2022.

Although, \nthe guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nDrug Involvement \nThe Concern: The illegal use of controlled substances, to include \nthe misuse of prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled \nsubstance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802.

An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds .  . . . AG \u00b6 18. \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd.

Additional security concerns are initially raised over Applicant\u2019s \naccumulation of delinquent debts \nDrug involvement concerns \nApplicant\u2019s randomized positive test for marijuana in 2021 warrants the \napplication of three disqualifying conditions (DCs) of the AGs for drug involvement. \nApplicable DCs are DC \u00b6\u00b6 25(a), \u201dany substance misuse\u201d; 25(b) \u201ctesting positive for an \nillegal drug\u201d; and 25(c), \u201cillegal possession of a controlled substance, including \ncultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia.\u201d \nLegally, licensed sales of hemp-derived CBD oil is not prohibited under either the \nFarm Bill of Applicant\u2019s state of residence or under the federal law enacted in December \n2018 (Public Law 115-334), provided that the hemp-related CBD product contains less \nthan 0..3 per cent of THC content. Important to keep in mind is the generally recognized \nfact that broad spectrum CBD oil can be expected to contain almost no THC, while full \nspectrum CBD products can obtain up to 0.3 per cent of the ingredient. In either \nsituation, for Applicant to produce positive test results for marijuana for what Applicant \ninsists was CBD oil he ingested, reliable findings of CBD oil with THC levels below the \n0.3 per cent THC levels allowed the accepted minimum allowable in his system (and not \nmarijuana) would be needed. \nPlausible explanations for the positive test results for marijuana in June 2021 are \nquite limited based on the evidence in the record. One possibility is Applicant\u2019s \npurchase of poor-quality CBD oil from an unlicensed retailer of CBD produced from a \nhemp plant by an unlicensed farm source containing THC content in excess of 0.3 \npercent. The other possibility is Applicant\u2019s purchasing marijuana from the same or \nother illegal source that exceeded the recognized 50 ng/mL grace amount. Either \noccurring event places Applicant in violation of federal and state criminal laws \ncontrolling the use of THC-laced products in CBD and marijuana in Applicant\u2019s state of \nresidence. \nTo his credit, Applicant has committed to abandoning all involvement with CBD \nand any other substances that could potentially place him at risk to testing positive for \nmarijuana. His assurances of sustained avoidance of CBD oil and any other products \nthat could contain THC warrant partial application of one mitigating condition (MCs) of \nthe drug involvement guideline: MC \u00b6\u00b6 26(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was \nso infrequent, or happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nor does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.\u201d \nStill, with the positive drug test for marijuana coming only two years prior to his \nhearing, coupled with his inability to document the type of CBD oil he claims to have \nused prior to his positive drug test, it is too soon to absolve Applicant of risks of \n8 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nrecurrence. Without more time to establish a probative pattern of sustained abstinence \nfrom the use of CBD oil and any other products that could potentially contain the \nprincipal marijuana ingredient (THC), none of the remaining mitigating conditions are \nfully available to Applicant at this time. \nWith only two-plus years of elapsed time since his 2021 positive drug test, more \ntime with more corroborating evidentiary sources to support his continued abstinence \nfrom CDC oil products and other marijuana products that contain levels of THC beyond \ndiscounted traces. More evidence of sustained abstinence is needed from Applicant to \nfacilitate safe predictions that he is no longer a recurrence risk. \nFinancial concerns \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s reported accumulation of two \ndelinquent debts exceeding $13,000. These debt delinquencies warrant the application \nof two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the financial consideration guidelines: DC \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d Each of these DCs apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical \nto an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in \nfollowing rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified \ninformation or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. \nBd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nApplicant\u2019s cited difficulties in finding employment following his Army discharge in \n2016 warrant the application of several mitigating conditions. Applicable mitigating \nconditions (MC) include MC \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial \nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances,\u201d and 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated and is adhering \nto a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance \nof a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through \nthe voluntary payment of accrued debts. See ISCR Case No. 19-02593 at 4-5 (App. Bd. \nOct. 18, 2021); ISCR Case No. 19-01599 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 20, 2020).

A hearing was scheduled for June 6, \n2023, and heard on the date as scheduled. At the hearing, the Government\u2019s case \nconsisted of six exhibits (GEs 1-6). Applicant relied on one witness (himself) and six \nexhibits (AEs A-F). The transcript (Tr.) was received on June 14, 2023. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline H, Applicant allegedly (a) used marijuana from about April 2021 \nthrough June 2021; (b) tested positive for marijuana in about June 2021 during a routine \ndrug screening; and (c) used marijuana and tested positive for the substance after being \ngranted access to classified information in about 2020. \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly accumulated two delinquent debts \nexceeding $13,000. Allegedly, these debts have not been resolved and remain \noutstanding. \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he admitted testing positive for marijuana in \nJune 2021 while holding. a security clearance. However, he denied his using marijuana \nprior to his positive test. He added explanations and clarifications. He claimed he used a \nCBD product sold in local stores to facilitate relief from his aches and pains associated \nwith his disabilities. He acknowledged his mistake to place his trust in a product he did \nnot know anything about and claimed he has since ceased using THC-enhanced \nsubstances (i.e., CBD oil). \nAddressing this delinquent debt allegations, Applicant claimed that he is paying \nhis listed delinquent accounts that became delinquent during a period of post-military \nretirement financial difficulties. He further claimed he was taking responsibility for his \ndelinquent accounts, and he added that he is currently paying off his two delinquent \ndebts. \nA final decision on the merits was issued on August 16, 2023. Applicant \nappealed the decision. On appeal, Applicant asserted the trial judge (a) failed to \nproperly consider all available evidence; (2) applied facts not supported by the record, \nrendering his adverse decision arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law; and (3) failed to \nproperly apply the mitigating conditions and conduct a whole-person analysis.

Specifically, the Board instructed the trial judge on remand to \nreopen the record, provide the parties with the specific administrative notice upon which \nhe will rely, and give them the opportunity to respond to those documents and submit \nadditional evidence or argument.\u201d (Appeal Board Decision at 4) \nNoting additional error in the trial judge\u2019s failure to make specific findings on a \nmaterial issue of whether Applicant\u2019s positive drug test for THC (presumably marijuana) \nwas the result of innocent use of CBD products, the Appeal Board further instructed the \ntrial judge on remand to assess and conclude whether Applicant \u201csufficiently established \nhis innocent use or consumption claim to refute the Guideline H SOR allegations before \nconducting a mitigation analysis.\u201d (Appeal Board Decision at 6) \nIn compliance with the Appeal Board\u2019s remand instructions, I reopened the \nrecord. In compliance with the Appeal Board\u2019s instructions, I furnished the parties \ncopies of the post-hearing materials I previously advised that I would be looking to for \nguidance on the question of positive tests for ingested CBD oil with THC content. (HE 1) \nConsideration of the reference materials was never intended for official or administrative \nnotice of undisputed facts in the public domain, but rather as reference materials to be \nused for guidance. After consideration of the respective objections and comments of the \nparties, I admitted these materials as hearing exhibits to be used solely for evidentiary \nguidance purposes. Assigned hearing exhibit numbers for these hearing exhibits are \nHEs 2 through 5. \nBesides reopening the record to furnish the parties copies of the articles \nreferenced in my initial decision, I offered them opportunities to provide comments and \nobjections to the articles and afforded them the opportunities to address the issue of \nwhether Applicant\u2019s use of CBD oil without any knowledge of whether the product \ncontained THC oil in excess of federal allowances, I referred the parties to a recent \nSupreme Court case (Ruan v. United States, 142 S. Ct. 2370 (2023)) to examine the \nknowledge criteria used by the Court to make credibility assessments of claims of \ninnocence. (HE 1) \nWithin the time permitted the parties provided post-remand briefs (inclusive of \nattachments to Applicant\u2019s brief) with additional comments and suggestions. The \nparties\u2019 briefing submissions were timely filed and addressed the issues covered by the \nRemand Order and my post-remand emails and were received and marked as HEs 6-8. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 54-year-old employee of a defense contractor who seeks a security \nclearance.

(GE \n1; Tr. 23) He has one child (age 14) from his latest marriage. \nApplicant has taken classes from a local university since 2019, but he has not \nearned a degree or diploma. (GE 1) He enlisted in the Army in March 1996 and served \nalmost 20 years of active duty before receiving an Army medical discharge in July 2016 \nwith a cited 345% disability that covered multiple pain issues in different areas of his \nbody. (GEs 1-2; Tr. 23, 28) \nSince September 2021, Applicant has been employed by his current defense \ncontractor as a field service representative. (GE 1) Previously, he worked for other \nemployers in various jobs. (GE 1) He reported unemployment between August 2016 \nand September 2019. (GEs 1-3) Applicant held a security clearance throughout his \nArmy enlistment, as well as with his previous employer before his termination in June \n2021 for cited reasons of testing positive for CBD oil containing THC. (GE 1; Tr. 23) \nApplicant continues to receive military disability pay and medical care from the Veterans \nAdministration (VA) to \u201cimprove my way of life.\u201d (Tr. 23) He is currently sponsored by his \nemployer for a security clearance. (GE 1; Tr. 29) \nApplicant\u2019s drug history \nDuring a routine, randomized drug screening in June 2021, Applicant tested \npositive for marijuana. (GE 5) Although the amount of THC in his system was not \nrecorded, enough THC was found to confirm a positive test for marijuana. As the result \nof his positive drug test, he was terminated from his employment. (GEs 1 and 6; Tr. 36) \nOnce Applicant learned of his positive drug test, he disposed of all of his \ncannabidiol (CBD oil). (Tr. 36) Prior to appearing for his scheduled randomized drug \ntest in June 2021, Applicant failed to notify either the Government or his employer at the \ntime that he was ingesting CBD oil. (Tr. 28-31) He neither challenged the positive test \nresults nor offered explanations to his then-employer of what might have caused his \npositive drug test. \nApplicant denied using marijuana prior to his positive drug test and claimed he \nhad tried a new product (CBD oil) recommended and given to him by a friend who \n\u201cbrought\u201d the CBD oil from another state (Applicant\u2019s Response; Tr. 23-24, 37) Before \nusing the brand CBD oil recommended to him by his friend at the time, he was gifted \nCBD oil on two prior occasions \u201cfrom a different source \u201cat a local gas station. (Tr. 23-\n24) Claiming he did not know the CBD oil he obtained was enhanced with THC (the \nmain psychoactive component of marijuana), he neither checked the contents of the \nproduct on his pre-test form he completed for his prior employer (Tr. 30-31) nor listed \nhis use of CBD oil in his electronic questionnaire for investigations processing (e-QIP) \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhe completed for his current employer. Asked why he did not disclose his positive drug \ntest to his current employer in the e-QIP section, covering illegal drugs, Applicant \nresponded that (a) \u201che didn\u2019t think it was \u201cgoing to be a big issue\u201d because he had not \nsmoked marijuana prior to his positive drug test and (b) his use of CBD oil was not court \nrelated. (Tr. 27) \nApplicant acknowledged his mistake of using pre-test CBD oil without providing \nany documented evidence of pre-test CBD oil in his system and its potential for \nproducing positive test results for marijuana. (Applicant\u2019s response; Tr. 24, 30-31) He \nbased his entire denial of marijuana in his system when tested on his verbal assurances \nthat he has never used marijuana and has since ceased using any form of CBD oil. \n(Applicant\u2019s Response, Tr. 24) Asked about documented proof of his taking CBD oil \nlaced with THC, Applicant could not provide any product labels, correspondence, or \nother proof to verify his use of CBD oil prior to testing positive for marijuana in his \nsystem. (Tr. 30) Whether the Veterans Administration (VA) would have prescribed CBD \noil to Applicant is unclear and may be dependent upon the levels of THC in the product \nto be prescribed. (Tr. 30) \nWhile THC is a chemical element typically found in both CBD-sourced hemp \nplants and marijuana plants, Applicant could furnish no evidence the oil used was \nproven to contain THC at levels that could be mistaken for marijuana in a randomized \ndrug test. (Tr. 32-35). Although traces of THC have been found in studies of CBD oil, \nresearch supporting the drug\u2019s benefits in treating these conditions is still limited. See \nBauer, What are the Benefits of CBD-and is it Safe to Use, Mayo Clinic Press (2023). \n(HE 3) \nWhen the concentration of THC in tested urine exceeds 50 ng/mL, most tests will \nyield a positive result according to data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention. See Urine Testing for Detection of Marijuana: An Advisory, \nhttps//www.cdc.go. (1983). (HE 2) Currently, the THC content in tested marijuana \ntypically exceeds 13 per cent. See C. Halderman-Englert, Cannabinoid Screen and \nConfirmation, Univ. of Rochester Medical Center, https.//www.urm.rochester.edu. \n(2023). (He 4) \nBy contrast, THC levels in CBD oils are advertised to contain no THC and \ntypically contain no THC, or very small traces (no more than 0.3 percent). See L. \nHellicar, Does Cannabidiol (CBDZ) Contain THC? in Medical News Today (2023). (HE \n5) Still, studies caution that in some lower-grade CBD products (depending on the \nsource of the marketed CBD oil), tested CBD products can contain sufficiently high \nlevels of THC to result in a positive marijuana test under random drug testing programs. \nSee id. Similar studies are cited in the Security Executive Agent\u2019s (SecEA) December \n2021 guidance on the risks associated with using CBD products that may cause \nsignificantly high levels of THC to result in a positive drug test under agency-\nadministered employment or random drug testing programs.

(Tr. \n36) Having cut off all ties and discarding of the products themselves when \u201che was fired \nfrom work), he could not document any evidence of the CBD products he used and \n\u201cexactly how they worked into my case.\u201d (Tr. 36)  \nPressed further at hearing for details on whether he checked to see whether the \nCBD products he used contained THC, he replied that he did not look at the labels on \nthe CBD products he obtained. (Tr. 37) The only helpful information he could provide \nwas that (a) one of his suppliers was a friend who purchased the CBD from a source in \nanother state and (b) his other two transactions were made at a local gas station without \nany acknowledged close checking of labels. (Tr. 37-38) Asked whether CBD is sold in \ngrocery stores or pharmacies, Applicant replied that he was not aware of such \nmarketing of the product, never \u201cwent back to look,\u201d and could offer no proof of his \nclaimed innocent ingestion of THC oil. (Tr. 38-39) \nBecause of the risk that CBD products can potentially contain varying amounts of \nTHC that exceed the federally and state-mandated maximum THC percent levels for \npublic marketing (i.e., 0.3 per cent), individuals are generally advised to check the labels \nof the CBD products they purchase in retail stores licensed to sell CBD products. See B. \nBauer, What are the Benefits of CBD-and is it Safe to Use, supra, (HE 4) \nBased on the evidence produced, interpretation of the test results associated \nwith Applicant\u2019s June 2021 positive drug test leaves only three plausible explanations:\n(1) Applicant knew, or is imputed to have known, there was THC in the CBD that\nexceeded or likely exceeded  authorized federal limits; (2) Applicant did not know the\nCBD he consumed was likely to contain an excessive amount  of THC; or (3) Applicant\nconsumed a substantial amount of CBD oil either at one time or through repeated\ningestion, so that even if the CBD oil met federal legal limits (i.e., 0.3 per cent), it would\nstill result in a positive urinalysis test result. Application of CBD oil use under either of\nthe situations covered in (2) or (3) could produce a favorable innocence result for\nApplicant based on a finding that he ingested a presumably legal product.  Conversely,\napplication of the situation covered (1) would not. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nResolution of Applicant\u2019s innocence claims requires a credibility assessment of \nApplicant\u2019s personal denials of any knowing use of THC-laced CBD oil prior to his \npositive 2021 drug test that takes into all of the surrounding circumstances associated \nwith his positive test and claims of innocent use. In Applicant\u2019s case, potentially \nfavorable alternative explanations of his positive drug test are neither plausible nor \ncredible without more information from Applicant on the identity and sources of the CBD \noil he claims to have obtained and used prior to his June 2021 positive drug test for \nmarijuana.

More corroborating information from Applicant is \nneeded to reconcile his claims of innocent use with the positive test results for \nmarijuana he received in 2021 \nApplicant\u2019s finances \nBetween 2011 and 2016, Applicant opened two consumer accounts exceeding \n$13,000 in the aggregate. (GEs 2-4; Tr. 25) Credit reports document that he defaulted in \nhis monthly payments on these two accounts in June 2022. He attributed these debts to \nhis difficulties in finding employment following his Army discharge in 2016. (GE 2) \nApplicant enrolled in a debt relief program in 2020 and has since paid in full the two \naccounts covered in the SOR (AEs C-F; Tr. 25) He is current with his other accounts \nand has no outstanding delinquent debts. Both of the covered debts in the SOR are \nresolved favorably to Applicant. \nEndorsements \nApplicant is well-regarded by his program and project managers.

These guidelines must be considered before deciding \nwhether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, \nthe guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Drug Involvement \nThe Concern: The illegal use of controlled substances, to include \nthe misuse of prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, \nrules, and regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled \nsubstance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802.

An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds .  . . . AG \u00b6 18. \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant\nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden\nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v.\nWashington Metro.

Important to keep in mind \nis the generally recognized fact that broad spectrum CBD oil can be expected to contain \nalmost no THC, while full spectrum CBD products can obtain up to 0.3 per cent of the \ningredient. In either situation, for Applicant to produce positive test results for marijuana \nfor what Applicant insists was CBD oil he ingested, reliable findings of CBD oil with THC \nlevels below the 0.3 per cent THC levels allowed the accepted minimum allowable in his \nsystem (and not marijuana) would be needed. \nPlausible explanations for the positive test results for marijuana in June 2021 are \nquite limited based on the evidence in the record. One possibility is Applicant\u2019s receipt \nof poor-quality CBD oil from an unlicensed retailer of CBD produced from a hemp plant \nby an unlicensed farm source containing THC content in excess of 0.3 percent. The \nother possibility is Applicant\u2019s receipt of marijuana from the same or other illegal source \nthat exceeded the recognized 50 ng/mL grace amount. Either occurring event places \nApplicant in violation of federal and state criminal laws controlling the use of THC-laced \nproducts in CBD and marijuana in Applicant\u2019s state of residence. Without convincing \nprobative proof of his innocent use of the CBD oil he claims was responsible for his \npositive drug test result, Applicant cannot satisfy his imposed evidentiary burden. \nUltimately, Applicant did not meet his evidentiary burden of proving he did not \nknow, or through reasonable inquiries could not have known that the CBD oil he \nobtained did not contain THC above the .03% limited set by the Farm Bill and endorsed \nin his home state of residence. Without more documented explanations from Applicant \non his good-faith efforts to ascertain the contents of the THC products he purchased \nbefore purchasing and using them, he failed to meet the evidentiary burden required to \nestablish his innocence under both Ruan requirements and the procedures prescribed \nby the Directive\u2019s procedural guidance for meeting an applicant\u2019s burden of proof. \nTo his credit, Applicant has committed to abandoning all involvement with CBD \nand any other substances that could potentially place him at risk to testing positive for \nmarijuana.

Without more time to establish a probative pattern of sustained abstinence \nfrom the use of CBD oil and any other products that could potentially contain the \nprincipal marijuana ingredient (THC), none of the remaining mitigating conditions are \nfully available to Applicant at this time. With only two-plus years of elapsed time since \nhis 2021 positive drug test, additional time with more corroborating evidentiary sources \nto support his continued abstinence from CDC oil products that contain levels of THC \nbeyond the legally authorized limits approved by federal law, more evidence of \nsustained abstinence is needed from Applicant to facilitate safe predictions that he is no \nlonger a recurrence risk. Mitigation is not available to Applicant at this time. \nFinancial concerns \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s reported accumulation of two \ndelinquent debts exceeding $13,000. These debt delinquencies warrant the application \nof two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the financial consideration guidelines: DC \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d; and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d Each of these DCs apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that \nentitles the person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving debt delinquencies are critical to an \nassessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in following \nrules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified information or to \nholding a sensitive position.

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nApplicant did not mitigate financial consideration concerns. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information or to hold a sensitive position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn September 21, 2022, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \n(DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) \nto Applicant detailing reasons why under the financial considerations guideline the DoD \nCAF could not make the preliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a \nsecurity clearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine \nwhether a security clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.

(Items 3 and 9) Afforded opportunities to document \nhis tax filings for these tax years, Applicant failed to provide any documentary proof \n(preferably tax transcripts) of his filing his tax returns for these years. \nBudgeting information to facilitate an assessment of Applicant\u2019s current financial \nsituation was not furnished. Without more documented evicence from Applicant about \nhow he is addressing his individual delinquent SOR debts and his 2016-2017 tax \nreturns, favorable inferences cannot be drawn. \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied.

The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern:  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds.  .  .  .  AG \u00b6 18.   \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant \nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions \nentail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, rather than \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nactual, risk of compromise of classified information.

See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. \n2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

While the principal concern of a \nsecurity clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and \ninfluence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving delinquent debts. \nHistorically, the timing of addressing delinquent accounts are critical to an \nassessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment in following \nrules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified information or to \nholding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23. \n2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015); ISCR Case No. 14-\n00221 at 2-5 (App. Bd.

In the past, the Appeal Board has \nconsistently imposed evidentiary burdens on applicants to provide documentation \ncorroborating actions taken to resolve financial problems, whether the issues relate to \ntax, consumer, medical, or other debts and accounts. See ISCR Case No. 19-02593 at \n4-5 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, 2021); ISCR Case No. 19-01599 at 3 (App. Bd.

Overall trustworthiness, reliability, and good judgment have not been \nestablished. \nBased on a consideration of all of the facts and circumstances considered in this \ncase, it is too soon to make safe predictions that Applicant will be able to undertake \nreasoned, good-faith efforts to mitigate the Government\u2019s financial concerns within the \nforeseeable future. More time is needed for him to meet the requisite levels of stability \nwith his finances to establish his overall eligibility for holding a security clearance. I have \ncarefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 \n(1988), Exec.

His friends \nwere using marijuana, and he wanted to feel involved. With the birth of his second child \nin 2014 and his relocation of his family to a state across the country late that year, he saw \nlittle of his camping friends with one exception. He used marijuana with that friend in 2015 \nand 2016. He used marijuana again one last time in December 2018. He has not used \nmarijuana in more than four years because he is a \u201cfamily man\u201d and is dedicated to \nworking hard to support his family. He also noted that he understands that using \nmarijuana is inconsistent with holding a security clearance and he no longer enjoys it. \n(Item 3 at 41; Item 4 at 10, 32; Item 6 at 3.) \n1.b. Use of marijuana after submitting his 2012 SCA. Applicant continued to use \nmarijuana after he signed his 2012 e-QIP, as described above. He commented in his \n2012 e-QIP that he does not plan on using marijuana again. (Item 3 at 41; Item 4 at 34; \nItem 5 at 3-4, 8.) \n1.c. Use of marijuana in December 2018 while holding a security clearance. \nApplicant was granted national security eligibility and a security clearance in about May \n2012. This allegation is focused solely on Applicant\u2019s one-time use in December 2018 \nwhile holding a security clearance. The reason for this limitation is unclear. In his e-QIP, \nApplicant wrote that his use of marijuana was \u201cvery infrequent\u201d and was \u201cless than once \na year at most\u201d during the past seven years (2013 to 2020). He also wrote in his e-QIP \nand in his Answer that he does not intend to use marijuana in the future because of his \nfamily responsibilities and his \u201crewarding career.\u201d In his Response, Applicant noted that \nhe intends \u201cto continue to abstain from all drug involvement and acknowledge[s] that any \nfuture involvement is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.\u201d He wrote that \nhis one-time use in 2018 at a New Year\u2019s Eve party in December of that year \u201cwas the \nlast time I ever used THC. He also wrote that the use of marijuana was \u201cnot an enjoyable \nexperience.\u201d He expressed his regret for \u201chis momentary lack of judgment\u201d \u201clate in the \nevening\u201d in which another person possessed the illegal drug. He also noted that he has \npromised his wife that he will never again take any action that might jeopardize his ability \nto support her and their two children. Applicant noted that he takes this promise very \nseriously. (Item 2 at 1, 2; Item 3 at 41; Item 4 at 32; Item 6 at 4; Response at 4.) \nParagraph 2 \u2013 Guideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe Government cross-alleged the three allegations set forth in paragraph 1 of the \nSOR under the Personal Conduct guideline. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 - Guideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for drug involvement and substance \nmisuse are set out in AG \u00b6 24, which reads as follows: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above.      \nAG \u00b6 25 describes two conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThe admitted facts in this case establish both disqualifying conditions and shift the \nburden to Applicant to provide mitigation of the Government\u2019s security concerns. \nAG \u00b6 26 includes two conditions in that could mitigate the security concerns arising \nfrom Applicant\u2019s drug involvement and substance misuse: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome the problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs are \nused; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging \nthat any future involvement or misuse is grounds for \nrevocation of national security eligibility. \nThe record evidence establishes both of the above mitigating conditions. \nApplicant\u2019s past use of marijuana while holding a security clearance occurred so long ago \nand was so infrequent that it is unlikely to recur. His limited number of uses in which he \nwas offered puffs of marijuana by others last occurred more than four years ago. His past \nbehavior does not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nHe has outgrown his prior errors in judgment, including his use of marijuana after \ncommitting to not use marijuana again in his 2012 e-QIP. \nIn addition, Applicant has acknowledged his past drug involvement with candor \nand openness. He has committed to abstain from using marijuana by promising his wife \nthat he will never again do anything to jeopardize his ability to support his family. He has \nalso promised himself that he will not jeopardize his career, which is important to him, by \nusing marijuana again. When he and his wife had their second child, they relocated across \nthe country to be near their families. Applicant is far away from his college environment \nand the college friends with whom he used to smoke marijuana on camping trips. He has \ncandidly admitted that he remains in contact with one close friend from his past, but that \nthere is no reason to believe that he cannot manage his relationship with that friend \nwithout using marijuana. Significantly, he has also signed his Response in which he \nformally committed to abstain from future drug involvement and acknowledged that and \nfuture involvement would be grounds for the revocation of his national security eligibility. \nApplicant has established mitigation of the security concerns raised by his past \nuse of marijuana before, and a few times after, being granted a security clearance. \nParagraph 1 is found for Applicant. \nParagraph 2 \u2013 Guideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for personal conduct are set out in \nAG \u00b6 15, which states: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes one condition that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information. \nApplicant\u2019s past use of marijuana after being granted a security clearance \nis certainly credible adverse information under the guideline for Drug Involvement \nand Substance Misuse. I have concluded that the record evidence does not \nsupport an adverse determination under that guideline. However, I also conclude \nthat his actions do not support application of the above-quoted potentially \ndisqualifying condition. As discussed below in my whole-person analysis, the \nrecord evidence does not support a whole-person assessment of questionable \njudgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, or unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. While Applicant\u2019s actions from 2012 to 2018, \nraise such concerns, his abstention from illegal drug use since December 2018 \nand his candor in admitting all of his drug history support a favorable whole-person \nassessment. AG \u00b6 16(c) is not established. Paragraph 2 is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s potential for national security eligibility by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nall pertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Further comments are \nwarranted. Applicant\u2019s history of illegal drug use spans a number of years, but ceased \nafter December 2018, more than four years ago. I have considered Applicant\u2019s age in the \ncontext of his use of marijuana while in college and for several years after that, including \nhis infrequent (once-annual) use after committing in his 2012 e-QIP that he did not intend \nto use marijuana in the future. I have also taken into consideration Applicant\u2019s current \nstatus as a husband and father of two young children. In the past four years, he has \nshown by his abstention from illegal drugs, and by his complete candor during the security \nclearance application process, that he has matured and is a responsible professional with \na solid career ahead of him. There is little likelihood of recurrence of his use of illegal \ndrugs. He has mitigated the concerns raised by providing evidence of \u201cpermanent \nbehavioral changes\u201d with respect to his use of marijuana. Overall, the record evidence \nleaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s suitability for national security \neligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1 - Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2 \u2013 Guideline E: \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nJOHN BAYARD GLENDON \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

Her admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 47 years-old. She has been married twice. She has two adult children. She separated from her second husband in December 2016. (Item 3 at 23.) She earned her bachelor\u2019s degree in 2002. (Item 3 at 11.) Applicant lost her job in January 2017 and moved from outside the continental United States (OCONUS) to the continental United States (CONUS) to obtain work. (Item 2 at 5.) She obtained employment in April 2017 and remained with the company until February 2018. (Item 3 at 14.) Thereafter, until May 2018, she lists just March 2018 as a period of unemployment, when she was hired by her sponsor as a senior manufacturing planner. (Item 3 at 13-14.) Applicant\u2019s debts consist of a personal loan in a charged-off status; an unpaid deposit for an apartment application in collection; and the balance on a mortgage account 2 that is in foreclosure status. The three delinquent debts total over $73,800. She attributes the delinquent debts to separation from her husband, loss of employment, subsequent unemployment, and costs associated with moving to CONUS to obtain employment after losing her job.

Prior to the job loss and move, she states her debts \u201cwere managed.\u201d \n(Response.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: past-due account charged off in the amount of $9,798. Applicant \nacknowledges the debt on her SCA. (Item 3 at 39-40.) In her January 3, 2022 ESI she \ndisputed the balance, citing payments she had made and money she requested be \napplied to the loan. (Item 5 at 2.) The May 23, 2022 credit report shows the status of the \ndebt as a charged-off account, with a last activity date of February 2017. (Item 6 at 2.)

This debt is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: past-due account referred for collection for $192. She denied the debt \nin her Answer and her dispute was noted on her October 1, 2021 credit report. (Item 7 at \n3.) In her Response she stated she was 100% certain she did not owe this debt and that \nshe had never lived in the apartment complex. She states that because an investigation \ncould take 30 to 60 days to complete, she would rather pay the amount and get it off her \ncredit report. She provided a letter from the creditor dated January 4, 2023, stating it had \nreceived final payment on the account and the debt was now satisfied. (AE C.) This debt \nis resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: past-due mortgage account for $63,810, with a total loan balance of \n$233,350, that is in foreclosure status. (Item 3 at 38.) Applicant states the mortgage \npayments were consistently made on time until she lost her job and was forced to move \nin January 2017. Her efforts were further complicated by the hurricane that struck her \nlocation in September 2017. (Item 2 at 5.) Her husband filed for divorce in 2019 and for \nbankruptcy in 2021, which complicated the foreclosure action. (Item 2 at 5.) She cites the \nCOVID pandemic for disrupting normal services which prevented the foreclosure. (Item 2 \nat 5.) She offered in her Response a letter dated November 2, 2022, from her current \nmortgage holder denying her request for a modified payment plan on the basis the \nmodified payment would cause her debt-to-income ratio to exceed the program\u2019s \nguidelines. (AE A at 1.) She cites in her Response multiple trips to her old location to \n\u201cmanage the process\u201d and find a solution. Based on her previous attempts to resolve this \ndebt and the fact the foreclosure process has started; she now believes the process of \nforeclosure on the house is the best way to resolve the debt \u201cdue to the economy and \ndynamics of the process in [her previous location].\u201d (Response.)

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThis case involves Applicant\u2019s inability to pay debts, arising from a series of life \nevents, the loss of employment, separation from her husband, and a geographical move. \nHer admissions and the documentary evidence in the FORM establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d); and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d) \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are relevant: \n(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is partially established. The circumstances she claims triggered the \nlargest debts are unlikely to recur, but they are recent and ongoing. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is partially established. Applicant lost her job in January 2017 and \nbecame estranged from her husband at about the same time. She was able to obtain \nemployment within a few months after her move. She does not support her claim that she \nacted responsibly under the circumstances to resolve the personal loan or mortgage debt, \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c. She did not present any documentary evidence that she undertook \naction to resolve either delinquent account prior to completing her security clearance \napplication in May 2018. She acted on SOR \u00b6 1.a in December 2022, after receiving the \nSOR. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is partially established. Applicant provided evidence to support her \nassertion that she had made a good-faith effort to resolve the debts. She paid SOR \u00b6 1.b \ndespite a clear dispute to the validity of the debt. After receiving the SOR she acted on \nSOR \u00b6 1.a in December 2022, and after not being successful in other offers to resolve \nthe mortgage debt she states she is relying on foreclosure to resolve SOR \u00b6 1.c. She only \nbegan seriously to address the loan after receipt of the SOR. See ISCR Case No. 17-\n04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). Her reliance upon foreclosure after receipt of the \nSOR does not equate to a good-faith effort to resolve her financial problem. Id. I conclude \nthat AG \u00b6 20(d) is not fully established for the delinquent personal loan or mortgage. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Because Applicant requested a \ndetermination on the record without a hearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate her \ncredibility and sincerity based on demeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n        \n \n          \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBd.

After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline F and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by her delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nAgainst Applicant  \nFor Applicant \n Subparagraphs 1.a and 1.c: \n   Subparagraph 1.b: \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

DOHA issued another notice on May 18, 2023, rescheduling the matter for a VTC \nhearing on June 14, 2023. I convened the hearing as rescheduled. \nAt the hearing, I admitted Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 12 and Applicant \nExhibits (AE) A through E, without objection. I sustained Applicant\u2019s objection to GE 13, \nan unauthenticated report of investigation summarizing two background interviews \nconducted by an authorized investigator in January 2022 and February 2022. At \nApplicant\u2019s request, I kept the record open until July 12, 2023, so that he could submit \nadditional documentation. He timely submitted documentation that I marked collectively \nas AE F and admitted in evidence without objection. Since AE F contains only a two-page \nexcerpt from Applicant\u2019s July 2023 credit bureau report titled \u201cCollections,\u201d and not the \ncredit bureau report in its entirety, I will consider this in the weight that I give it. DOHA \nreceived the hearing transcript of the initial hearing on May 25, 2023 (Tr. 1) and of the \nsubsequent hearing on June 27, 2023 (Tr. 2). \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all the SOR allegations, with explanations. He is 39 years old. \nHe married in 2012, divorced in 2018, and remarried in 2021. He has five minor children. \nHis eldest child is his ex-spouse\u2019s niece that they adopted from foster care during their \nmarriage; the next two children are from his first marriage; and the youngest two children \nare from his current marriage. He graduated from high school in 2012. He has owned his \nhome since 2014. (Tr. 2 at 24-25, 28, 35-36, 42, 67-77; GE 1, 10) \nAs of the date of the hearing, Applicant has worked for his employer, a DOD \ncontractor, since July 2016. He began as a pipefitter and then he became a nationally \ncertified radiographer in October 2020. He was first granted a security clearance in 2018. \n(Tr. 1 at 5; Tr. 2 at 5-6, 24, 41-42, 87, 106) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had 13 delinquent debts, totaling $23,898 (SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.m) It also alleged that he had six judgments, totaling $11,073, entered against \nhim between June 2017 and February 2021 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n-1.s). The SOR allegations are \nestablished by his admissions in his Answer; his September 2021 security clearance \napplication (SCA); credit bureau reports from June 2016, December 2021, and \nSeptember 2022; and court records. (Answer; GE 1-12) \nApplicant attributed his delinquent debts to his April 2017 separation from his ex-\nspouse, his August 2018 divorce, and minimal income. At a date not in the record, a court \nordered that he and his ex-spouse share joint legal custody of their children but awarded \nher physical custody and ordered him to pay her $135 weekly in child support. At that \ntime, he earned $18 hourly as a pipefitter, and she earned approximately $20 hourly as \na pharmacy technician. In addition to paying for his living expenses and child support \nobligation, he was responsible for paying the mortgage.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information).   \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of not paying his debts.

In light of the record evidence, I find the following: SOR \u00b6 1.b is \na duplicate of SOR \u00b6 1.p; SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.j, and 1.l are duplicates of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n and 1.o; \nSOR \u00b6 1.e is a duplicate of SOR \u00b6 1.r; and SOR \u00b6 1.f is a duplicate of SOR \u00b6 1.s. In \naddition, Applicant paid the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.m. As such, I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, \n1.j, 1.l, and 1.m in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nDespite Applicant\u2019s position that he is not responsible for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a \nbecause the divorce decree ordered that he and his ex-spouse were responsible for their \nown debts, he co-signed on this auto loan during his marriage so that his then-spouse \ncould buy a car. This debt was reported on his 2021 credit bureau report, and he did not \nprovide documentation to show that he paid or otherwise resolved it. This debt is \nunresolved. He also did not provide documentation to show that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c, \nwhich is reported on both his 2021 and 2022 credit bureau reports, is among the debts \nunderlying the judgments in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n and 1.o. This debt is also unresolved. He also \ndid not provide documentation to corroborate his claim that he disputed the debts in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.k. Since he acknowledged that he did not pay them and they were \nreported on his 2022 credit bureau report, these debts are also unresolved. \nApplicant believed he was resolving his debts through wage garnishment when six \ngarnishment orders were entered against him beginning in 2018 and through 2021. \nThrough such orders, he paid the judgment in SOR \u00b6 1.q in March 2021, before the SOR, \nand he paid the judgment in SOR \u00b6 1.o in October 2022, and I therefore find these \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nallegations in Applicant\u2019s favor. However, the Appeal Board has long held that reliance on \ngarnishment or other involuntary means of debt resolution does not equate to a good-faith \nrepayment by the debtor. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-06058 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2009). \nAs of the date of the hearing, the wage garnishment for the judgment in SOR \u00b6 1.p had just \nbegun, and the execution of the wage garnishment orders for the judgments in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.n, 1.r, and 1.s were pending. He had not made efforts to contact the creditors directly \nto resolve these debts. These debts are also unresolved. \nApplicant\u2019s 2023 credit bureau report, which reflects a delinquent rental or leasing \naccount in collection for $1,115, reflects that his financial problems are ongoing. He has \nnot received financial counseling. He needs more time to establish that he has his \nfinances under control. I find that these financial issues continue to cast doubt on his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e) do \nnot apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-\nperson analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude that Applicant has \nnot mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d-1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m:   \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.n: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.o: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.p: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.q: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.r-1.s: \nAgainst Applicant \n Conclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He was arrested at about 3:00 a.m. after police pulled him over for \nspeeding. He was convicted of DUI. He was sentenced to 30 days in jail, which were all \nsuspended. His driver\u2019s license was suspended for a year. He claimed that, at that time, \nhe associated with a group of sailors who drank a lot and enjoyed going to bars and \nclubs.

Police administered him a breathalyzer test and the result\nindicated that he had a 0.17 percent blood alcohol content (BAC). He pleaded guilty to a\nlesser DUI offense and served 10 days in jail. He was placed on probation until 2013\nand his license was suspended for a year. His command gave him a Captain\u2019s Mast\nand the Navy out-processed him but allowed him to take full retirement based upon his \npast military record.

He claimed he would \nhave a drink or two at lunch or dinner. He claimed he drank about six to eight beers per \nmonth. During an August 2015 interview with a DOD investigator, Applicant told the \ninvestigator that he had modified his drinking habits by no longer drinking to the point of \nintoxication, and he no longer associated with the same crowd who liked to go out and \nparty. He also told the investigator that he did not foresee having additional DUIs. \nHowever, in June 2021, he was arrested in State B and charged with DUI, .16 (percent) \nor higher. Earlier that night, after working late, he had about five drinks over three-and-\na-half hours with dinner. Afterwards, he drove to a karaoke bar and drank more there. \nDespite drinking too much, he left the karaoke bar at about 3:30 a.m. to drive home, but \npolice pulled him over for driving erratically, speeding, and failing to use his turn signal. \nHe failed a field sobriety test and was given a breathalyzer. His breathalyzer test result \nindicated that he had a 0.16 percent BAC. The DUI charges were ultimately dismissed \nfor an alleged lack of evidence, but he pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of careless \ndriving. He was required to pay a $400 fine. (Tr. 32-35, 61-65; Answer; GE 3-6) \nApplicant claimed that after his June 2021 arrest, he had a \u201creset,\u201d but he still \nconsumes alcohol and has a drink or two with dinner. He testified that he still drives \nafter consuming alcohol, but he does not drive if he has had more than one drink. He \nclaimed that if he has had more than one drink, his wife drives home from dinner. He \ntestified that he has not driven while intoxicated since June 2021 and that was the only \ntime he did so in the last 10 years. He claimed that his social circle now consists of \nmostly extended family who are not big drinkers or bargoers. He also claimed that he \ndrinks less because he has health issues that are exacerbated by drinking too much \nalcohol, he wants to keep his job, and he wants to have a healthy retirement. (Tr. 32-36, \n38-40, 66-69; Answer; GE 6) \nApplicant claimed he has not been diagnosed as alcohol dependent or as an \nalcoholic. Applicant claimed that no alcohol counselor or medical professional has \nadvised him to stop drinking. On October 24, 2023, Applicant had a consultation with a \ncounselor who holds a master\u2019s degree in counseling education and is a licensed \nprofessional counselor. After this consultation, the counselor diagnosed Applicant with \nAlcohol Use, Mild, in sustained remission. He then underwent at least one other session \nwith the same counselor. The counselor made no recommendation regarding Applicant \nabstaining from alcohol. (Tr. 31, 75-76; AE C) \nWhile he was in the Navy, Applicant earned the Meritorious Service Award, \nwhich he claimed is not normally awarded to an enlisted servicemember. He deployed \nto a combat zone for about ten months beginning in October 2007. He retired from the \nNavy as an E-8, which is the second highest enlisted pay grade available. He has \nreceived praise from his supervisors and customers regarding his work performance. \nHis colleagues, friends, and family have written character-reference letters advocating \nthat he be awarded a security clearance and attesting to his good character, \ntrustworthiness, reliability, and patriotism. His spouse also wrote that she does not think \nhe has a problem with alcohol and that he is merely a social drinker. In contravention of \nApplicant\u2019s testimony, she claimed that he does not drive after he has been drinking. \n(Tr. 24-25, 36-37; Answer; AE A, B) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nApplicant was arrested and charged with DUI in 2004, 2009, and 2021 after \ndrinking too much and deciding to drive. The above-referenced disqualifying conditions \nare established and the burden shifts to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations;  \n(c) the individual is participating in counseling or a treatment program, has \nno previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory \nprogress in a treatment program; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \nOn at least three occasions over a span of about 17 years, Applicant has \nconsumed far too much alcohol, made the decision to drive, and been arrested for DUI. \nAlthough it has been about two years since Applicant\u2019s most recent alcohol-related \narrest, his pattern of problematic impaired driving, with gaps of five to eight years in \nbetween incidents, casts doubt on whether these incidents are likely to recur. Moreover, \nhe continues to drive after drinking. He claimed that he has modified his alcohol intake \nand no longer associates with people who drink a lot; however, he made these claims \nprior to his latest DUI. For these reasons, he has not met his burden to show that the \nbehavior is unlikely to recur. He also has not met his burden of showing that he has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption. AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a), \n23(b), and 23(d) do not apply. \nApplicant went to a treatment or counseling program, but he subsequently drove \nafter drinking too much and was again arrested for DUI. AG \u00b6 23(c) does not apply. \nApplicant did not mitigate the alcohol consumption security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline G in my whole-person analysis. I have also considered \nApplicant\u2019s lengthy, honorable military service, his deployment, his positive character \nevidence, and his good employment record. However, I find that the totality of the \nevidence, including his DUIs, his willingness to continue to drink and drive, and his \nfailed efforts to effectively modify his alcohol consumption in the past leaves me with \nquestions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nI conclude Applicant did not mitigate the alcohol consumption security concerns. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact: \nApplicant is 46 years old, married (December 2002), with a son age 9 and a \ndaughter age 11. His spouse was born in Colombia and is a citizen of Colombia and the \nUnited States and a resident of the United States.

Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant has seven \ndelinquent accounts that have been charged off or are in collections totaling $29,037. \nThose debts became delinquent between November 2017 and July 2019. (Exs. 1 and 6.) \nHe admitted those allegations. (Ex. 2.) \nApplicant identified each of the seven accounts in his SCA. For each of the seven \ndelinquent accounts, he recited as a reason his above explanation for his one year of \nunemployment. To that explanation, he added that he let the accounts be charged off or \ngo into collection \u201cas an act of desperation on our part . . . [and in] hindsight I do regret \nmaking bad judgment to do that.\u201d For all but one account, he stated \u201cI am in the process \nof resolving this debt.\u201d For SOR \u00b6 1.e, he stated that it was paid in full on June 11, 2021. \n(Ex. 3.) With his Answer, he submitted a document showing that four of the SOR accounts \nhave been enrolled with a debt relief agency. That document does not show that those \naccounts (which includes SOR \u00b6 1.e) have been resolved.

His son was born prematurely on December 19, 2013. \nAs a result, his son was in a neonatal care unit from December 2013 to September 2014. \nHe began to work part time so he could spend time with his son in the hospital. He incurred \ndebts and living expenses that his part-time paycheck could not cover. His debts became \ndelinquent when he and his wife went to Colombia in March 2017 to seek medical \ntreatment for his daughter (then five years old) who was autistic. Her medical treatments \nleft very little money to pay bills. He is currently seeking help from a credit counseling and \nconsolidation agency and intends to pay his overdue bills. (Ex. 5.) \nGuideline B. Under Guideline B, the SOR alleged that Applicant\u2019s: (1) spouse is \na dual citizen of Colombia and the United States; (2) spouse owns property in Colombia \nwith an approximate value of $50,000; and (3) mother-in-law, sister-in-law, and brother-\nin-law are citizens and residents of Colombia. (Ex. 1.) Applicant admitted the first \nallegation but said that his spouse last visited Colombia in April 2019 and does not travel \nthere regularly. He admitted the second allegation but said his spouse only made a down \npayment of $20,000. He admitted the third allegation. (Ex. 2.) \nApplicant\u2019s last trip to Colombia was in 2017. The investigation disclosed \nApplicant\u2019s contacts with Colombia and with his Colombian mother-in-law, brother-in-law, \nand sister-in-law. His mother-in-law is a homemaker. She is not employed outside of the \nhome. She has no connections with the Colombian government, its military, or any \nbusiness or entity owned by the Colombian government. His spouse is in telephonic or \nvideo chats with her mother about weekly. He also participates briefly in those \ncommunications. (Exs. 4 and 5.) \nApplicant\u2019s Colombian brother-in-law and sister-in-law are employed by the same \nself-owned software company. They have no connections with the Colombian \ngovernment, military, or any business or entity owned by the Colombian government. He \nand his spouse speak to those in-laws by telephone about weekly. None of his in-laws \nreceive financial support from Applicant; nor does he receive any financial support from \nthem. (Ex. 4 and 5.)  \nApplicant explained his spouse\u2019s ownership of real property in Colombia. The \nproperty was purchased in 2021. It is not important to his overall financial situation. It was \npurchased to have as a place to vacation when he retires. He is still making payments to \nown the home. He is not vulnerable to foreign influence because of the property. He plans \nto maintain ownership, because he wants to keep the property as a vacation home for \nretirement.

Of note is \nthat Colombia is one of the oldest democracies in Latin America. The United States is \nColombia\u2019s largest trading partner. Colombia has been plagued by transnational criminal \nand narcotics trafficking organizations, terrorist organizations, and armed criminal gangs. \nColombia also continues to have human rights problems. Any person born in Colombia \nmay be considered a Colombian citizen, and dual U.S.- Colombian citizens are required \nto present a Colombian passport to enter and exit Colombia. \nLaw and Policies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv.

These guidelines are \nflexible rules of law that apply together with common sense and the general factors of the \nwhole-person concept. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nGuideline F notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following conditions are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \nThe SOR debts are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and the Government\u2019s \ncredit reports.  AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply.  \nGuideline F also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. Having reviewed all of the mitigating condition under AG \u00b6 20, \nI find only the following potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;   \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the \nproblem is being resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nI have considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant\u2019s SOR debts became \ndelinquent between November 2017 and July 2019. That is not that long ago. And they \nwere not infrequent. They remain delinquent today. I find that AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply.  \nI have considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(b), which has two elements. First, \nthe applicant\u2019s financial problems must be caused by conditions \u201clargely beyond the \nperson\u2019s control.\u201d Second, the person must \u201chave acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances.\u201d Applicant\u2019s decision to travel to Colombia to seek medical treatment for \nhis daughter who suffered from autism was understandable. Her condition was largely \nbeyond his controI, thus satisfying the first element of AG \u00b6 20(b). \nThe next inquiry is whether Applicant acted responsibly in light of the \nconsequences of his decision to go to Colombia to seek treatment. Those consequences \nwere unemployment and an increase in expenses. Faced with those consequences, he \nelected to let his household accounts go into collections or be charged off. He candidly \nadmitted that his choice was not responsible and was \u201cbad judgment\u201d that he regrets. I \nagree. I find that AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have considered mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(c). Applicant has enrolled four of \nhis SOR debts in a debt relief program. And he has sought credit counseling. That is a \ngood start. He earns partial credit under AG \u00b6 20(c) for those efforts. He has not yet, \nhowever, shown a track record of resolving any of his debts. The Appeals Board has \nrequired an applicant to show a track of paying or otherwise resolving debts beyond just \nenrolling in a debt relief program or getting financial counseling. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 20-01510 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 2021), citing ISCR Case No. 14-04565 at 2 (App. \nBd. Sep. 18, 2015). Therefore, AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply in full. For the same reason, \nmitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nI find against Applicant on SOR \u00b6 1. \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern under the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in AG \n\u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and  \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country,\nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the\nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation. \n \n \n7 \n\n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Government contends that AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), (b), and (f) apply. Applicant has three \nrelatives by marriage who are citizens and residents of Colombia, his mother-in-law, his \nbrother-in-law, and his sister-in-law. His mother-in-law is a homemaker. His brother and \nsister-in-law work for the same privately owned software firm. None of those relatives \nhave any connections to the Colombian government or military. His last visit to Colombia \nwas in 2017 to seek treatment for his daughter. His spouse last visited Colombia in 2019. \nNeither he nor his spouse regularly visit Colombia. His spouse speaks with her relatives \nabout weekly by telephone, and he sometimes participates. He does not receive any \nfinancial support from his in-laws. \nSOR \u00b6 2.b is directed at the property Applicant\u2019s spouse owns in Colombia. He \nadmitted that ownership and its approximate value of $50,000. He added that his spouse \npaid the $20,000 down payment. Thus, the balance is about $30,000. He also stated that \nthe property was purchased in his spouse\u2019s name. Her funds, not his, were used for the \npurchase. \nI also considered that Applicant could liquidate that property to resolve his debts \nin the United States. I discounted that for three reasons. First, he stated that it was an \ninvestment in the future as a home for retirement or vacations. Second, he stated that the \nproperty is not important to his overall financial situation. Courts routinely permit \nindividuals to testify about the financial significance of their assets. See, e.g., Sabal Trail \nTransmission LLC v. 3921 Acres of Land, 947 F. 3d 1362, 1368-69 (11th Cir. 2020). \nFinally, he has enrolled his SOR debts in a credit relief program and has sought financial \ncounseling. He is addressing his financial difficulties. I find that the property is not a \n\u201csubstantial . . . property interest.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law, and his spouse\u2019s brother and sister-in-law are citizens \nand residents of Colombia. His spouse owns property in Colombia. Applicant intends to \nkeep that property for vacations or as a retirement home. Colombia has been plagued by \ntransnational criminal and narcotics trafficking organizations, terrorist organizations, and \narmed criminal gangs. Colombia also continues to have human rights problems. \nApplicant\u2019s foreign contacts create a potential conflict of interest and a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and coercion, both directly and \nthrough his wife. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), 7(b), and 7(f) have been implicated by the evidence. \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following is potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S. \nI considered the totality of Applicant\u2019s ties to Colombia. Colombia has significant \nproblems, but it is also one of the oldest democracies in Latin America.

In light of the nature and extent of Applicant\u2019s \nconnections to Colombia, I find it unlikely he will be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of the United States and the interests of the Colombian \ngovernment, a terrorist group, a criminal organization, or a drug cartel. AG \u00b6 8(a) is \napplicable. I find for Applicant on SOR \u00b6 2. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \nThe security concern relating to Guideline E for personal conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \nThe SOR alleges three workplace infractions, two that resulted in written warnings \nand one that resulted in a written violation with a one-day penalty of work without pay. \nThose infractions were in 2017 and 2019. Applicant admitted those infractions. \nDepartment Counsel observes that the first two infractions are \u201cnot overly concerning.\u201d I \nconcur. Applicant provided credible explanations for those, an absence due to a trip to \nthe ER for his son and missing a training he did not think he was scheduled for. These \nfirst two infractions were de minimis in nature. \nThe third incident involved Applicant\u2019s failure to follow appropriate procedures for \nchecking tools in and out of the workplace. Department Counsel characterizes this as an \naccusation of theft. But Applicant claims he was falsely accused and that changes have \nsince been made. I do not characterize the incident as something as nefarious as theft, \nbut it was a violation. \nThe SOR does not specify which disqualifying condition under AG \u00b6 16 applies. \nDepartment Counsel argues that because Applicant did not disclose these three incidents \nin his SCA or in his interrogatory responses, this shows a \u201cpattern of rules violations.\u201d \nFORM at 4. That would trigger AG \u00b6 16(d)(3): \u201ca pattern of dishonesty or rule violations.\u201d \nBut the SOR does not allege facts supporting that disqualifying condition. The \u201cpattern\u201d \nmust include the first two incidents, which were de minimis. Therefore, the \u201cpattern\u201d is an \nallegation not asserted in the SOR. Nor does the SOR allege a deliberate failure to \ndisclose the three incidents. Unalleged conduct cannot be an independent basis for a \ndenial. See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). Thus, Applicant\u2019s \nfailure to disclose the three incidents and the pattern those incidents might portray cannot \nbe grounds for a denial.

AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) (explaining the \n\u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and its factors). In my analysis above, I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant leaves me with questions about his eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For these reasons, I conclude that the security concerns under Guideline F, \nfinancial considerations, have not been mitigated. I conclude that there are no established \nGuideline B, foreign influence, concerns and that security concerns under Guideline E, \npersonal conduct, have not been established. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 g.: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a. \nFor Applicant \n Subparagraphs 2.a. \u2013 c.: \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.c without further comment. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is 31 years old. Record evidence reflects that he was engaged to be married in late 2021 and has no children. He graduated college in 2014. Shortly afterwards, he obtained employment as a software engineer and has since been consistently employed. He has been with his current employer as a software engineer since 2021. (GX 3-4) In his June 2021 SCA, Applicant disclosed that he began using marijuana in 2010, during his first year in college. The frequency of his marijuana use varied from as little as four times per year to as often as four times per week. He stopped using for a period in 2016 when he experienced \u201cbad anxiety and paranoia\u201d after consuming a marijuana edible.

Applicant did not respond to \nthe FORM. \nThe case was assigned to me on April 11, 2023. The SOR and the Answer (GX \n1-2) are the pleadings in the case. GX 3-4 are admitted without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.c without further comment. His \nadmissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and evidence submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 31 years old. Record evidence reflects that he was engaged to be \nmarried in late 2021 and has no children. He graduated college in 2014. Shortly \nafterwards, he obtained employment as a software engineer and has since been \nconsistently employed. He has been with his current employer as a software engineer \nsince 2021. (GX 3-4) \nIn his June 2021 SCA, Applicant disclosed that he began using marijuana in \n2010, during his first year in college. The frequency of his marijuana use varied from as \nlittle as four times per year to as often as four times per week. He stopped using for a \nperiod in 2016 when he experienced \u201cbad anxiety and paranoia\u201d after consuming a \nmarijuana edible. However, he later resumed using marijuana and disclosed that his last \nuse was in May 2021, a month before submitting his SCA. He stated he would not use \nmarijuana for the period he held a security clearance. (GX 3) \nDuring his September 2021 background interview, Applicant disclosed that he \npurchased marijuana from 2010 through 2014. He further disclosed that he had \nconsumed, smoked, and vaped a variety of marijuana products from 2010 into 2021, \nincluding after he submitted his SCA. Although Applicant resides in a state where \nmarijuana is legal, he acknowledged his awareness that marijuana was illegal under \nfederal law. Still, Applicant stated that he intends to continue using marijuana in the \nfuture because he \u201cenjoys the autonomy to smoke\u201d even though he claimed to not like \nmarijuana. (GX 4) \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted that he used marijuana from about \nOctober 2010 through July 2021, a month after he submitted his SCA and that he \npurchased marijuana from 2010 through 2014. He further admitted his intention to \ncontinue using marijuana in the future. He did not provide any additional information \nbeyond his admissions.

As the \nSupreme Court held in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard \nindicates that security determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \n484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988) \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information.

Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline \nto describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nI have considered the disqualifying conditions for drug involvement under AG \u00b6 \n25 and the following are potentially applicable: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nThe Controlled Substances Act (\u201cCSA\u201d) makes it illegal under federal law to \nmanufacture, possess, or distribute certain drugs, including marijuana. (Controlled \nSubstances Act, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801, et seq. See \u00a7 844). All controlled substances are \nclassified into five schedules, based on their accepted medical uses, their potential for \nabuse, and their psychological and physical effects on the body. \u00a7\u00a7811, 812. Marijuana \nis classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, \u00a7812(c), based on its high potential \nfor abuse, no accepted medical use, and no accepted safety for use in medically \nsupervised treatment. \u00a7812(b)(1). See Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1 (2005). \nIn October 2014, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued a \nmemorandum entitled \u201cAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use,\u201d (2014 \nDNI Memo) which makes clear that changes in the laws pertaining to marijuana by the \nvarious states, territories, and the District of Columbia do not alter the existing National \nSecurity Adjudicative Guidelines, and that federal law supersedes state laws on this \nissue: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuidelines. . . . An individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the \nuse, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations. As always, adjudicative authorities are \nexpected to evaluate claimed or developed use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. The adjudicative authority \nmust determine if the use of, or involvement with, marijuana raises \nquestions about the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nwillingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, including federal \nlaws, when making eligibility decisions of persons proposed for, or \noccupying, sensitive national security positions. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board, which I am required to follow, has cited the 2014 DNI \nMemo in holding that \u201cstate laws allowing for the legal use of marijuana in some limited \ncircumstances do not pre-empt provisions of the Industrial Security Program, and the \nDepartment of Defense is not bound by the status of an applicant\u2019s conduct under state \nlaw when adjudicating that individual\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 14-03734 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Feb. 18, 2016). The current National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines went into effect on June 8, 2017, after the 2014 DNI memo was \nissued. Nevertheless, the principle continues to apply. \nMoreover, on December 21, 2021, DNI Avril D. Haynes issued a memorandum \nentitled, \u201cSecurity Executive Agent Clarifying Guidance Concerning Marijuana for \nAgencies Conducting Adjudications of Persons Proposed for Eligibility for Access to \nClassified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position.\u201d (2021 DNI Memo) The \nmemo incorporates the AGs (at reference B) and the 2014 DNI Memo (at reference G) \namong various other relevant federal laws, executive orders, and memoranda. I take \nadministrative notice of the 2021 DNI memo here, given its relevance to this case, its \nreliance on the AGs, and its recency. \nThe 2021 DNI memo specifically notes that \u201cunder policy set forth in SEAD 4's \nadjudicative guidelines, the illegal use or misuse of controlled substances can raise \nsecurity concerns about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness to access \nclassified information or to hold a sensitive position, as well as their ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d (The 2021 DNI memo cites Guideline H, \nalleged in this case, and the AGs for personal conduct and criminal conduct, Guidelines \nE and J, not alleged in this case). Thus, consistent with these references, the AGs \nindicate that \u201cdisregard of federal law pertaining to marijuana remains relevant, but not \ndeterminative, to adjudications of eligibility for access to classified information or \neligibility to hold a sensitive position.\u201d (2021 DNI Memo) \nAn applicant's use of illegal drugs after having completed a security clearance \napplication or after otherwise having been placed on notice of the incompatibility of drug \nabuse and clearance eligibility raises questions about his or her judgment, reliability, \nand willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n17-04198 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2019).

See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 19-00540 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2019). \nApplicant began using marijuana when he started college in 2010. He continued \nusing marijuana after graduating college in 2014. He stated in his June 2021 SCA that \nhe would terminate his marijuana use in order to hold a security clearance. However, he \ncontinued using marijuana as recently as July 2021. During his September 2021 \nbackground interview, Applicant acknowledged his awareness that marijuana was illegal \nunder federal law but stated his intent to continue using marijuana anyway. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) \nand 25(g) both apply. \nThe adjudicative guideline includes two conditions in AG \u00b6 26 that could mitigate \nthe security concerns arising from Applicant\u2019s drug use: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: (1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) \nchanging or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) \nproviding a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement \nand substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement is \ngrounds for revocation of national security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use was both recent and frequent. He initially used \nmarijuana in 2010 and stopped only for a brief period in 2016 when he experienced bad \nanxiety and paranoia from his use. Still, despite his claims that he does not like \nmarijuana, he resumed using marijuana for years and continued after he submitted his \nSCA in 2021. In his September 2021 background interview, he stated his intent to \ncontinue using marijuana and admitted this intent in his Answer to the SOR. I find that \nApplicant has shown a history of conduct that is of a security significance. Further, he \nhas chosen to continue this conduct by continuing his drug use. The circumstances and \nextent of Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use preclude application of mitigation under either AG \u00b6 \n26(a) or AG \u00b6 26(b). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline H in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant did not request a hearing, nor did he respond to the FORM. In so \ndoing, he did not provide any additional evidence in explanation or mitigation beyond his \nAnswer, and I had no opportunity to evaluate his credibility and sincerity based on \ndemeanor. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, 2003). The record \nevidence reflects that Applicant has a long history of marijuana use and has chosen to \ncontinue using marijuana despite the potential security ramifications. Overall, the \nfrequency, recency and seriousness of Applicant\u2019s conduct leaves me with questions \nand doubts as to his suitability for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a - 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

On August 1, 2922, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DODCAF) issued Applicant a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines H (Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse); and E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nthe Adjudicative Guidelines, effective on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 4, 2022 (Item 2), and requested a \ndecision on the record without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the \nGovernment\u2019s written case on September 12, 2022. A complete copy of the file of \nrelevant material (FORM) was sent to Applicant, including documents identified as \nItems 1 through 5.

(Item 3 at pages 5 and \n20.) \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse & Guideline E - Personal \nConduct \n1.a.~1.e., and 2.a. Applicant admits that he used the following illegal substances: \nmarijuana with varying frequency from 2010 through August 2018; cocaine with varying \nfrequency from 2014 through August 2018; psilocybin mushrooms with varying \nfrequency from 2012 through August 2013; NDMA (Ecstasy) on three occasions from \n2012 through 2014; and LSD on two occasions in 2013. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \n2.b. Applicant admits that in June of 2018 he was arrested, and subsequently \npled guilty to Driving While Impaired. His subsequent urinalysis tested positive for \ncocaine. \n2.c. Applicant admits that he willfully falsified his December 2021 e-QIP by failing \nto disclose his above mentioned marijuana and cocaine abuse. \n2.d. and 2.e. Applicant admits that he willfully falsified material facts during his \ninterviews with DoD investigators in February and again in March of 2022. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number \nof variables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \n\u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing \nmultiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline H - Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and \nSubstance Misuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Two conditions are established: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nAppellant used marijuana, cocaine, psilocybin mushrooms, MDMA (Ecstasy), \nand LSD. Therefore, AG \u00b6 25 (a) and (c) are established. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6\u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts;  \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and  \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility. \nNone of these apply, as Applicant\u2019s misuse of illegal substances is fairly recent. \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse is found against Applicant. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo \nor cooperate with security processing, including but not \nlimited to meeting with a security investigator for subject \ninterview, completing security forms or releases, cooperation \nwith medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to \nlawful questions of investigators, security officials, or other \nofficial representatives in connection with a personnel \nsecurity or trustworthiness determination. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, \ninvestigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity \neligibility \ndetermination, \nor \nother \nofficial \ngovernment \nrepresentative; and \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant falsified his December 2021 e-QIP, and was not candid with \ninvestigators in his subsequent interviews. He also used illegal substances, and was \nconvicted for his drug misuse. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying \nconditions. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 including: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur. \nNone of these are applicable. His repeated falsifications were willful and fairly \nrecent. Applicant also has a drug abuse problem. Personal Conduct is found against \nApplicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s national security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national \nsecurity eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence leaves \nme with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from his drug involvement and substance abuse, and personal \nconduct. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a~1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a~2.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",
