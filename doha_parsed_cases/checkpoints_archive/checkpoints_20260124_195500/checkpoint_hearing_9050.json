Soviero, Esq. \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nTUIDER, Robert J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has mitigated security concerns pertaining to Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). Clearance is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted an undated and unsigned Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP).1 On May 20, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F (financial considerations) for Applicant. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), \nas amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by \nthe President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense \nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \n1Applicant previously submitted a security clearance application (SF-86) that was also \nunsigned, but dated June 30, 1997. \nMarch 23, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 4, 2009, which DOHA received \non July 8, 2009. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on August 31, 2009. \nThe case was assigned to me on September 2, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on September 4, 2009, scheduling the hearing for October 2, 2009. The \nhearing was held as scheduled. \n \nThe government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8, which were \nreceived without objection. The Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through P, \nwhich were received without objection, and he testified on his own behalf.  \n \nI held the record open until October 17, 2009, and subsequently granted an \nextension until October 30, 2009, to afford the Applicant the opportunity to submit \nadditional documents on his behalf. Applicant timely submitted AE Q through RR, \nwhich were received without objection. DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.) on \nOctober 9, 2009. The record closed on October 30, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a., 1.c., 1.d., 1.f., 1.g., and 1.h. \nwith explanations. He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. and 1.e. with \nexplanations. His answers with explanations are incorporated herein as findings of \nfact. After a thorough review of the evidence, I make the following additional findings \nof fact. \n \nBackground Information \n \nApplicant is a 46-year-old senior analyst, who has worked for his defense \ncontractor employer since October 2004. GE 1, Tr.15-16, 85-86. He seeks to renew \nhis security clearance, which is a requirement for his continued employment. Tr. 45-\n46, 55, 89, AE L.  \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in June 1981. Tr. 84-85, GE 1. He has \ncompleted numerous service schools while serving in the military. Tr. 85. Applicant \nmarried in March 1987. Two daughters were born during that marriage, ages 22 and \n18. GE 1, Tr. 86. Applicant and his wife have been separated since the summer of \n2002. Tr. 8, 86. \n \nApplicant served in the U.S. Army from March 1983 to December 1987, and \nwas honorably discharged as a sergeant (pay grade E-5). GE 2, AE Q. He served in \nthe U.S. Army Reserve from December 1987 to March 1990, and was honorably \ndischarged as a sergeant. GE 2, AE R. He served in the Army National Guard from \nMarch 1990 to March 1992, and was honorably discharged as a sergeant. GE 1, GE \n2, AE S. He served in the U.S. Air Force from April 1997 to April 2003, and was \nhonorably discharged as a staff sergeant (pay grade E-5). GE 1, AE T. Applicant has \ncontinuously and successfully held a security clearance since he first entered the \nArmy in 1983, a period of 27 years. Tr. 89, AE W. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed his financial situation and \nincluded the review of his undated e-QIP; his June 1997 SF-86; his December 2008 \nResponses to DOHA Financial Interrogatories; his August 1997, August 2008, and \nMay 2009 credit reports; a Lexis printout of his judgment; and court records from his \n1994 bankruptcy proceedings. GE 1 \u2013 8.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR identified seven separate debts -- one judgment, and six \ncollection accounts, approximating $27,000. Tr. 7. \n \nThe allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a. documents a 1994 Chapter 7 bankruptcy. As \nnoted supra, Applicant had been discharged from the Army National Guard in 1992. \nApplicant was laid off from his company and consequently was unable to remain \ncurrent on his debts. He consulted with a bankruptcy attorney and was advised to file \nfor bankruptcy protection. Appellant was awarded a discharge in September 1994. Tr. \n19-23, 57-58, 76-78, GE 8. \n \nApplicant has settled, paid or made a good-faith attempt to resolve the seven \ndebts alleged. A brief summary of each debt follows. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. is \na civil judgment in the amount of $15,372 in favor of a collection agency. That debt \nwas satisfied by a Warrant to Satisfy Judgment filed in August 2007. Applicant paid \n\u201calmost $14,000\u201d to satisfy this judgment. Tr. 24-25, 58-62, 78-80, AE B. The debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. is a collection account on behalf of a cable company in the \namount of $584. Although Applicant disputed this debt, he paid it in July 2009. Tr. 25-\n26, 63, AE C. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. is a collection account on behalf of a \ncredit card company in the amount of $646. Applicant successfully disputed this debt \nclaiming it was a fraudulent transaction and the creditor accepted his explanation and \nceased further collection activity in July 2009. Tr. 26-28, 63-65, 80-81, AE D. \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. is a collection account on behalf of a cable and \ninternet service company in the amount of $626. Although Applicant disputed this \ndebt, he paid it in June 2009. Tr. 28-29, AE E. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f. is a \ncollection account on behalf of a telephone company in the amount of $51. The record \nis replete with numerous good-faith attempts by Applicant\u2019s attorney beginning in June \n2009 to resolve this account. As of the hearing, the telephone company had not \nresponded to Applicant\u2019s attorney. Tr. 30-31, 37-39, 64-66, 81-82, AE G-H, AE J-K, \nAE O. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g. is a collection account on behalf of an \nautomobile leasing company in the amount of $9,142. After Applicant and his wife \nseparated, his wife took possession of the vehicle and failed to make the remaining \nthree payments as promised. The vehicle was repossessed and sold at auction. This \naccount was settled for a lesser amount and paid in October 2009. Tr. 31-36, 66-71, \n82-83, AE F, AE H-J, AE P, AE PP-RR, AE VV. The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. is a \ncollection account on behalf of a storage company in the amount of $162. This debt \nwas paid in July 2009. Tr. 36-37, AE N. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to his inability to remain current on \nhis debts while deployed with the military. As noted supra, Applicant and his wife \nseparated during the summer of 2002. Tr. 45-47, 89. Applicant\u2019s wife is self-\nsupporting. Tr. 74. \n \nIn conclusion, Applicant has paid, settled, made good-faith efforts to repay \noverdue creditors, or resolved all debts alleged. He submitted a budget with his \nmonthly expenses, which reflects a net remainder of $1,384. His budget further \ndemonstrates that he is living within his means. Tr. 51-53, 90-91, AE M.  \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \nApplicant provided reference letters from his senior director, logistics \nmanager/team lead, and training/fielding manager. These individuals are senior \npersons within Applicant\u2019s company, who have known him for a lengthy period of time. \nThey verified the importance of the work he is doing on behalf of the nation\u2019s defense \nand his potential for future service. They all spoke of his professionalism, dedication to \nduty, value as an employee, and recommended him for a security clearance. AE L, AE \nX-Y. \n \nApplicant submitted performance evaluations for the years 2007 and 2008. \nThese evaluations reflect above average performance and document Applicant\u2019s \nvalue as an employee. AE U-V. Applicant also submitted copies of numerous awards \nand training certificates from his military service. AE Z-NN. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In \naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are \nuseful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based \n\n \n5 \n \n \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude one relevant security concern is under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial \nproblems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt is established by his admissions and evidence \npresented. As indicated in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. to 1.h., he had seven delinquent debts totaling \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \nabout $27,000 that have been in various states of delinquency. The government \nestablished the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), \nand \nthe \nindividual \nacted \nresponsibly \nunder \nthe \ncircumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) or 20(b) \nbecause he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve his delinquent \ndebt. Because there is more than one delinquent debt, his financial problems are not \nisolated. The debts were not paid until 2009, and therefore his debt is \u201ca continuing \ncourse of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-\n11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. \n16, 2002)). He receives partial credit under AG \u00b6 20(a) because the debt \u201coccurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s 1994 \nbankruptcy lacks security significance because of the passage of time. Under AG \u00b6 \n20(b), he receives partial mitigation because of his inability to focus on his finances \nwhile in a deployment status and being separated from his wife. However, he did not \nprovide sufficient information to establish that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances.2  \n \n2\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not applicable because there is no evidence of financial \ncounseling. However, there is sufficient information to establish full mitigation under \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(d)3 and 20(e). Applicant retained counsel and successfully resolved his \ndebts. Applicant has settled or paid all debts except the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f. \nApplicant presented substantial evidence documenting good-faith efforts to contact the \ncreditor and for reasons unknown that creditor failed to respond to any of Applicant\u2019s \novertures.   \n \nFurthermore, AG \u00b6 20(e) is applicable to mitigate the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d. \nbecause the Applicant provided \u201cdocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the \ndispute.\u201d The creditor closed the account and ceased all further collection efforts. He \nunderstands the security implications of delinquent debt and will scrupulously avoid \nfuture delinquent debt. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, \n \n(App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. \n99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A \ncomponent is whether he maintained contact with his creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep his debts current. \n \n3The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood-faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive \ndoes not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the \nconcept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows \nreasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, \nan applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available \noption (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \n\u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n\n \n8 \n \n \nexploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must \nbe an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).  \nThere is evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. The SOR lists seven \ndebts totalling $27,000 that were at one time or another in various states of \ndelinquency. He failed to keep his accounts current and negotiate lesser payments, \nshowing some financial irresponsibility and lack of judgment. His lack of success \nresolving delinquent debt raises sufficient security concerns to merit further inquiry.   \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is more substantial. \nApplicant\u2019s record of military service and good employment weighs in his favor. There \nis no evidence of any security violation during the 27 years Applicant held a security \nclearance. He is a law-abiding citizen. His debts are current and his SOR debts are all \npaid. His monthly expenses are current. The Appeal Board has addressed a key \nelement in the whole person analysis in financial cases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019\u201d necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant \nis not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each \nand every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019 The \nJudge can reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial \nsituation and his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s \nplan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and \nrealistic. See Directive \u00b6  E2.2(a) (\u2018Available, reliable information about \nthe person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, should be \nconsidered in reaching a determination.\u2019) There is no requirement that a \nplan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. \nRather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for \nthe payment of such debts one at a time. Likewise, there is no \nrequirement that the first debts actually paid in furtherance of a \nreasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. \n \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). \nApplicant is making a significant contribution to the national defense. His supervisors \nfully support him and recommend him for a security clearance. He made mistakes, \nand debts became delinquent. There is, however, simply no reason not to trust him. \nHe has paid his debts. Furthermore, he has established a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of \ndebt payments. These factors show responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. After \nweighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \n\n \n9 \n \n \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude he has mitigated the \nfinancial considerations security concerns.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nhe is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the \nSOR, as required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. to 1.h.: \n For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nRobert J. Tuider \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n \n",

He is employed by a defense contractor and seeks to retain a security clearance previously granted in connection with his employment. Guideline F, Financial Considerations The Government alleges in the first paragraph of the SOR that the Applicant is financially overextended and therefore at risk of engaging in illegal acts to generate funds. The Applicant admitted all of the allegations under this guideline. Those admissions are hereby deemed findings of fact. The Applicant met his ex-wife while they were both in the Air Force. They were married for three and a half years and the majority of debts in the SOR were incurred during the marriage. The Applicant\u2019s divorce from his wife in 2006 was very difficult for him emotionally. He suffered from personal problems, as further discussed below. One of these problems was that he stopped paying a lot of his bills until early in 2009. The Applicant took full responsibility for the debts, even those of his now ex-wife, and Department Counsel conceded that all debts save one have been paid. (Transcript at 17, 29.)

On November 25, 2008, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\ndetailing the security concerns under Guidelines F, G, and J, concerning the Applicant.\nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant filed an Answer to the SOR on January 2, 2009, and requested a\ndecision without a hearing. Pursuant to Paragraph E3.1.7 of the Additional Procedural\nGuidance at Enclosure 3 of the Directive, Department Counsel requested that a hearing\nbe held in this case. (Transcript at 9.) Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on\n\n2\nJanuary 30, 2009. I received the case assignment on April 6, 2009.  DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on April 8, 2009. The hearing was convened on May 22, 2009.  \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 6, which were received\nwithout objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and submitted Applicant\u2019s\nExhibits A through D, which were received without objection. The Applicant requested\nthat the record remain open until June 5, 2009, for the submission of additional\ndocuments. The Applicant submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits E and F in a timely fashion,\nand they were received without objection.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing\non May 29, 2009.  The record closed on June 5, 2009.  Based upon a review of the\ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 36 and divorced. He is employed by a defense contractor and\nseeks to retain a security clearance previously granted in connection with his\nemployment.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government alleges in the first paragraph of the SOR that the Applicant is\nfinancially overextended and therefore at risk of engaging in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  The Applicant admitted all of the allegations under this guideline. Those\nadmissions are hereby deemed findings of fact.\nThe Applicant met his ex-wife while they were both in the Air Force. They were\nmarried for three and a half years and the majority of debts in the SOR were incurred\nduring the marriage. The Applicant\u2019s divorce from his wife in 2006 was very difficult for\nhim emotionally. He suffered from personal problems, as further discussed below. One\nof these problems was that he stopped paying a lot of his bills until early in 2009. The\nApplicant took full responsibility for the debts, even those of his now ex-wife, and\nDepartment Counsel conceded that all debts save one have been paid. (Transcript at\n17, 29.) The Applicant testified, \u201cAll of the court proceedings was a really big wake-up\ncall that I need to start paying off the debts now.\u201d (Transcript at 48.)\nSubparagraph 1.a.  The Applicant admits that he owed $78 on a past due\naccount. This debt has been paid in full.  (Government Exhibit 6 at 1; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\nB at 25.)  \nSubparagraph 1.b.  The Applicant admits that he owed $56 for a past due\nmedical bill.  This debt has been paid in full. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A; Transcript at 46-47.)\nSubparagraph 1.c.  The Applicant admits that he owes $14,000 on a credit card\ndebt. The records show that the amount actually past due on this account is $6,000.\n(Government Exhibit 3 at 11, Exhibit 6 at 1; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B at 15-16.) The\n\nSubparagraph 3.a. of the SOR was amended on motion of the Department Counsel to read, \u201ca. That\n1\ninformation set forth in subparagraph 2.a. above.\u201d (Transcript at 9-11.)\n3\nApplicant has made arrangements to pay his arrearage to this creditor starting May 31,\n2009, and ending October 31, 2009. The Applicant submitted documentary evidence\nthat this arrangement is acceptable to the creditor, and that he made his first payment of\n$500 on May 31, 2009. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E at 2-3.)\nSubparagraph 1.d.  The Applicant admits that he owed $399 for a past due credit\ncard account. This debt has been paid. (Government Exhibit 6 at 2; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\nB at 13, 17, 25.)\nSubparagraph 1.e.  The Applicant admits that he owed $3,856 for a past due\ncredit card account. This debt has been paid. (Government Exhibit 6 at 1; Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit B at 11.)\nSubparagraph 1.f.  The Applicant admits that he owed $696 for a past due credit\ncard account. This debt has been paid. (Government Exhibit 6 at 2; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\nB at 14, 24.)\nSubparagraph 1.g.  The serial number for the debt in this subparagraph is\n1001319882 as shown in the credit report. (Government Exhibit 3 at 4.) The serial\nnumber for the debt set forth in subparagraph 1.b., above, is 1001319882 in a second\ncredit report. (Government Exhibit 6 at 1.) I find that this is the same debt as that set\nforth in subparagraph 1.b., above.\nSubparagraph 1.h.  A review of the entry for this debt of $78 in the applicable\ncredit report (Government Exhibit 3 at 6) states that it was collecting the debt for the\ncreditor reported as being paid this amount in the most recent credit report (Government\nExhibit 6 at 1.) I find that this is the same debt as that set forth in subparagraph 1.a.,\nabove. \nSubparagraph 1.i. The Applicant admits that he owed $1,164 for a past due\naccount. This debt has been paid. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B at 15.)\nAs of the date the record closed, the Applicant had paid approximately $6,749\ntowards the debts in the SOR. The Applicant currently lives with his parents, and is able\nto pay all of his obligations in a timely manner in the future. (Transcript at 32, 55-56.)\nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption\nGuideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct\nThe Government alleges under Guideline G that the Applicant is ineligible for\nclearance because he uses intoxicants to excess. The Government further alleges\nunder Guideline J that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because has he engaged\nin criminal acts. The Applicant admitted the factual allegations under both guidelines.\nThose admissions are hereby deemed findings of fact.   \n1\n\n4\nThe Applicant has had one alcohol-related arrest, which occurred on January 19,\n2007. He was on business travel shortly after his separation from his wife. The\nApplicant got very intoxicated and crashed his car into a tree, afterwards waking up in\nthe hospital. (Transcript at 33-37.)\nHe plead guilty to Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol (DUI) and was\nsentenced to three years unsupervised probation, fines/fees/restitution of $1,843,\ncommunity service, one year of Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, and a nine-months-\nduration DUI course. The Applicant has completed all of the sentence requirements\nexcept the community service. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit F, Transcript at 37-40.)\nThe Applicant testified that he has not had anything to drink since October 2007.\nIn that month, he was placed on probation by his employer due to missing work\nbecause of drinking. He is no longer on probation at his job, and testified that he has no\ninterest in drinking in the future because \u201cwork is my life and if I lost that, then I need to\nchange my life.\u201d (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C and Exhibit D; Transcript at 42-43.) \nAs stated above, one way the Applicant has changed his life is by moving back in\nwith his parents. Regarding this move, he testified, \u201cI thought it was the best thing to do\nat the time. They\u2019re very supportive. So I felt it was a good change of environment.\u201d\n(Transcript at 49.)\nMitigation\nThe Applicant submitted a letter dated December 31, 2008, from his direct\nmanager. This person states: \nWhile [the Applicant] has had some trials and challenges a year\nago, he has made significant efforts to learn from the decisions he made,\nchange his behavior and work on correcting the results of his past events.\nDue to this significant improvement, I have increased [the Applicant\u2019s]\ntasking and level responsibility. While we would in no way jeopardize the\nfirms reputation or put ourselves in a position of increased liability, we do\ntrust [the Applicant] and view him as a reliable and valuable member of\nour team. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D.)\nThe Applicant also submitted his most recent evaluation from his job. The\ndocument shows that he is a highly respected and successful employee. (Applicant\u2019s\nExhibit E at 5-9.) \nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\n\n5\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.  In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his own common sense,\nas well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the world, in\nmaking a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n6\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise security concerns.\nThe Applicant admits that he owed the debts set forth under paragraph 1 of the SOR.\nThe evidence is sufficient to raise this potentially disqualifying condition, requiring a\ncloser examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 20(c)\napplies if \u201cthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol.\u201d  Evidence that \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d is also mitigating under AG \u00b6 20(d).  \nBy his own admission, the Applicant made some poor personal choices after his\nwife left him. Among them was failing to pay his bills for a substantial amount of time.\nThe Applicant has made great strides in paying his overdue bills, and has paid a\nsubstantial amount of money towards the arrearage.  Only one of the debts stated in the\nSOR has not been paid, and he has made arrangements to pay that debt. He showed\nthat this failure was an aberrant situation and it will not be repeated. I conclude these\npotentially mitigating conditions apply.\nGuideline G - Alcohol Consumption\nGuideline J \u2013 Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out\nin AG \u00b6 21:      \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of\nquestionable judgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness.\n\n7\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 30:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a\nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nThe Applicant was involved in a single alcohol-related arrest in January 2007.\nThe Applicant has not used alcohol since October 2007, after a work-related incident,\nwhich the Applicant first discussed in his Answer to the SOR. Even though not alleged\nin the SOR, I am considering this incident under this Guideline.\nThere is one Disqualifying Condition concerning Alcohol Consumption that\narguably applies to this case.  AG \u00b6 22(a) \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work,\nsuch as driving while under the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the\npeace, or other incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed\nas an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent.\u201d  \nI have also considered AG \u00b6 22(b). \u201calcohol-related incidents at work, such as\nreporting for work or duty in an intoxicated or impaired condition, or drinking on the job,\nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent.\u201d  \nUnder the particular facts of this case, the following mitigating conditions clearly\napply to the Applicant\u2019s situation. AG \u00b6 23(a) states that it can be a mitigating condition\nwhen, \u201cso much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened\nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on\nthe individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment.\u201d  In addition, AG \u00b6\n23(b) applies where, \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of\nalcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has\nestablished a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an\nalcohol abuser).\u201d\nUnder the Criminal Conduct guideline, the following Disqualifying Conditions are\napplicable.  AG \u00b6 31(a) \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d and AG \u00b6\n31(d) \u201cindividual is currently on parole or probation.\u201d\nAfter considering the evidence in the record, I find that the following mitigating\nconditions also apply to this case.  Under AG \u00b6 32(a) \u201cso much time has elapsed since\nthe criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that\nit is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness or good judgment.\u201d  In addition, AG \u00b6 32(d) states, \u201cthere is evidence of\nsuccessful rehabilitation, including but not limited to the passage of time without\nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education,\ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d\n\n8\nWhen viewed in the light least favorable to the Applicant, he has had two alcohol-\nrelated incidents in the past three years.  Only one of those incidents involved drinking\nand driving, which resulted in an automobile accident where he was hospitalized.  While\nthis is certainly nothing to be taken lightly, there is no evidence of a pattern of abuse\nhere.  His last incident occurred over a year and a half before the record closed.  I have\nconsidered the fact that he is still on probation, as well as his attendance at a nine-\nmonth DUI program and his decision to stop drinking in 2007.  The evidence is clear\nthat the drinking and driving offense was an aberration, out of character, and will not be\nrepeated.  The Applicant has mitigated the security significance of these incidents.  \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of\nwhether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person\nconcept. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant got into financial\ndifficulty because of a poor personal decision that he regrets and persuasively showed\nwill not be repeated. He has paid off all of his past due debts but one. With regards to\nthat creditor, he has an approved plan and is fulfilling it. The Applicant is a hard-\nworking, respected, professional person who has had two alcohol-related incidents in\nthe last three years.  There is little to no evidence that these incidents show a pattern, or\nthat he is alcohol-dependent or an alcohol abuser.  In viewing all the facts of this case, I\nfind that the Applicant has mitigated the security significance of his prior conduct.  As\nset forth at length above, I find that there have been permanent behavioral changes\nunder AG \u00b6 2(a)(6). He has behaved reasonably, maturely and appropriately in trying to\nresolve the Government\u2019s concerns.  Under the particular circumstances of this case, I\nfind that there is little to no potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b6\n2(a)(8)), and that there is also little to no likelihood of recurrence (AG \u00b6 2(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\n\n9\nconsiderations, alcohol consumption and criminal conduct.  Paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 are\nfound for the Applicant.  He is currently eligible for a security clearance.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.I:\nFor the Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline G:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nFor the Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline J:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e, 1.g, and 1.k-1.m. She denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, and 1.h-1.j. Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the evidence of record, and having considered Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 41-year-old senior programmer analyst employed by a defense contractor. She received her bachelor\u2019s degree in computer base systems management in 1990, and her master\u2019s of education in mathematics and computer science in 1993. In 2003, she had access to classified information at the secret level for a period of eight months. She was hired by her current employer in February 2008, and received interim access to classified information pending her security background investigation. There is no evidence that she has ever compromised classified information or that she has caused others to do so. Applicant married her husband in July 2000 and they are currently separated. She has had a difficult marriage, marred by numerous separation periods. They were separated from October 2004 to March 2006 (Tr. 37), during 2008, and from January 2009, to the present (Tr. 33-34). She has four children of this marriage, ages 17, 11, 10, and 6. Until her January 2009 separation, she also was caring for her 13-year-old stepson. 1 On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum directing application ",

She lacks a track record of financial responsibility. She failed to \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn February 8, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). On February 26, 2009, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant \nto Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \nOctober 30, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \ndated January 2, 1992, as modified and revised.1 The SOR alleges a security concern \nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA \ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for her, \nand recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance \nshould be granted, denied or revoked. \n \nOn April 21, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on May 15, 2009. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on June 2, 2009. The hearing was convened as \nscheduled on June 30, 2009. The government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 7, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf \nand submitted Applicant Exhibits (AE) 1 and 2, post hearing, which were admitted \nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 7, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the factual allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e, 1.g, and 1.k-1.m. \nShe denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, and 1.h-1.j. Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings \nof fact. After a thorough review of the evidence of record, and having considered \nApplicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 41-year-old senior programmer analyst employed by a defense \ncontractor. She received her bachelor\u2019s degree in computer base systems management \nin 1990, and her master\u2019s of education in mathematics and computer science in 1993.  \n \nIn 2003, she had access to classified information at the secret level for a period \nof eight months. She was hired by her current employer in February 2008, and received \ninterim access to classified information pending her security background investigation. \nThere is no evidence that she has ever compromised classified information or that she \nhas caused others to do so. \n \nApplicant married her husband in July 2000 and they are currently separated. \nShe has had a difficult marriage, marred by numerous separation periods. They were \nseparated from October 2004 to March 2006 (Tr. 37), during 2008, and from January \n2009, to the present (Tr. 33-34). She has four children of this marriage, ages 17, 11, 10, \nand 6. Until her January 2009 separation, she also was caring for her 13-year-old \nstepson.  \n \n \n1  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of the revised Adjudicative Guidelines to all adjudications and other determinations \nmade under the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security \nProgram (Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, \n2006.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant claimed she has received almost no financial assistance from her \nspouse since 2008. He did not have a job before May 2009. She does not know where \nhe is and has not been able to force him to provide financial support for her children (Tr. \n73).  \n \nApplicant started having financial problems between 2000 and 2005. She filed for \na Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in June 2005, to prevent foreclosure on the \nmortgage on her home. The bank agreed to work a payment plan with her, and she \nrequested the dismissal of her bankruptcy. Applicant sold her home in March 2007 (Tr. \n18). She attributed her financial problems, past and present, to four main causes: her \nhusband\u2019s periods of unemployment and his inability to find a steady job; her periods of \nunemployment and underemployment; her marital problems; and a failed business \nenterprise. Because of her limited income, she could not afford to pay both her past \nfinancial obligations and her day-to-day living expenses.  \n \nApplicant testified her downfall over the last 11 years has been her inability to \nbudget and to live a lifestyle commensurate with her earnings. She explained that when \nher spouse was working they lived the lifestyle of a two-income family. When he was \nunemployed, she was not able to modify her lifestyle and expenses to make their \nlifestyle proportionate for their reduced income (Tr. 74). \n \nApplicant has been continuously employed since April 2000, except for periods of \nunemployment from October 2004 to February 2005, and while in between jobs. She \nwas underemployed during 2005, when she was self-employed. She has worked for \ngovernment contractors, or the government, from June 2005 to the present. She has \nbeen working for her current employer, a government contractor, since February 2008. \n \nIn her February 2008 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed having \nfiled for bankruptcy in 2005, and that she had financial problems because of her periods \nof unemployment and her marital separations. Her background investigation addressed \nher financial status and included the review of March 2008, February 2009, and May \n2009 credit bureau reports (CBRs), her response to DOHA interrogatories, and her \nsecurity clearance application.  \n \nThe SOR alleges 12 delinquent and/or charged off accounts, totaling \napproximately $35,000, which have been delinquent for a number of years. In her \nresponse to the SOR, Applicant admitted the medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 \n1.e, and 1.k and 1.l were her debts. She explained that most of her medical debts were \nacquired when she was unemployed or self-employed and did not have medical \ninsurance. She claimed that, at the time, her spouse was paying the family debts and he \nfailed to address some of her medical bills (Tr. 28). Seven of the alleged delinquent \ndebts can be considered as small debts since they are for less than $400. \n \nShe claimed that some of the medical bills were incurred after she was employed \nand had medical insurance. Although some of the medical bills were already denied by \nher insurance carrier, she is resubmitting the medical bills for reconsideration. When \n\n \n4 \n \n \nasked which of the seven alleged debts were acquired after she was employed and had \ninsurance, Applicant indicated she had not researched the debts and could not identify \nthem. Applicant\u2019s documents show her insurance company has been paying medical \nbills incurred while under coverage (AE 2). \n \nApplicant satisfied the judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f for $445 in April 2007 (AE \n1). She admitted the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g for $5,082, is her debt and that it has \nbeen delinquent for a number of years. She took a loan based on her anticipated 2003 \nfederal income tax return. The Internal Revenue Service intercepted Applicant\u2019s 2003 \ntax refund and she did not have the money to repay the loan. Applicant contacted the \ncreditor for the first time three weeks before her hearing. She was offered a lump sum \ndiscounted settlement, but she does not have money to resolve this debt. She promised \nto settle and pay it in the near future (Tr. 53).  \n \nShe claimed the creditor will not take partial payments because the account has \nbeen charged off. Applicant never contacted the creditor prior to three weeks before the \nhearing, because she did not have the money to pay this or the other outstanding debts. \nShe has very limited funds and needs to use available income to pay her utility bills and \nother necessities (Tr. 56) \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h for $15,000 concerned a second mortgage \nApplicant took on a real estate property. It was paid in 2007, when she and her spouse \nsold the home (Tr. 59, GE 2, p. 8). The debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i for $12,987 concerned \na second mortgage (or equity loan) that Applicant took on another real estate property \nshe owned and sold in 2003. She claimed the second mortgage or equity loan was paid \nwith the proceeds of the sale (Tr. 59). The May 2009 CBR supports her claim (GE 4, p. \n4).  \n \nApplicant disputed the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.j, concerning a debt for telephone \nservices placed on collection by the provider. She claimed she paid this debt, and has a \ntelephone services account with the same telephone service provider that is current (AE \n2, at 6). I find this allegation for Applicant.  \n \nApplicant expressed remorse for her financial problems. She claimed she was \nnot able to make more progress resolving her debts because of her January 2009 \nseparation. After her separation, she was trying to keep the house together both \nemotionally and financially. She admitted she continued to live the lifestyle of a two-\nincome household (Tr. 33-34). She explained she continued her two-income lifestyle \nbecause she was trying to protect her children, keeping them involved in their routines \nand activities.   \n \nIn May 2009, Applicant realized she could not afford to live the lifestyle of a two \nincome household, and she started to change her lifestyle. She has been doing budget \nspreadsheets as her first step to reduce her expenses to conform to a one-income \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                           \nbudget (Tr. 66). At the time, her truck was past due as well as all of her other debts.2 \nShe testified that of the hearing date, her truck account was current and that she was \ncurrent in almost all of her utilities (Tr. 35). She started working on her medical bills first \nbecause resolving them would involve filing claims and not taking money that she needs \nfor her family\u2019s day-to-day living expenses.  \n \nWhen questioned further, Applicant admitted she had to ask her father for a \npersonal loan to prevent her truck from being repossessed. Even with her father\u2019s loan \nshe is still one month behind on her truck payment (Tr. 96). Also, she admitted that as \nof the day of her hearing, she was one month behind on her electric and water bill. She \npromised she would pay those accounts as soon as she received her next pay check \n(Tr. 97). \n \nApplicant\u2019s 2009 CBR shows she bounced a check. When asked about the \ninsufficient funds draft, she claimed it was her husband who issued the check and that \nshe intends to dispute the charges. The 2009 CBR shows the check was issued against \nher individual account (GE 4, at 3). She failed to present documentary evidence to show \nit was her spouse\u2019s check or that she disputed the charges.  \n \nApplicant has not participated in any financial counseling (Tr. 65). As of he \nhearing day, her net monthly income was around $6,107, with monthly expenses of \napproximately $5,898. Because it was summer and she was not paying for child care, \nher net remainder was approximately $587. When she pays child care, her net \nremainder is around $87.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \n \n2  Applicant drives a 2004 GMC Yukon Denali-V8 she purchased in August 2008 for approximately \n$19,725 (AE 2, p. 4). When asked why she did not purchase a more economical vehicle she said she \ncould not fit her kids in a smaller car (Tr. 103). \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                           \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d3 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by department counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \ngovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the security concern is that failure or inability to live within \none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \n \n3  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having \nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \nThe SOR alleged 12 delinquent and/or charged off debts that have been \ndelinquent for a number of years. Applicant has resolved four debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, and \n1.h \u2013 1.j), totaling approximately $29,023. She still has eight debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.e, \n1.g, 1.k, and 1.l), totaling approximately $6,393 that are past due. These debts are \nApplicant\u2019s debts as established by the evidence and Applicant\u2019s admissions. In her \npost-hearing submission, Applicant promised to pay SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c - 1.e and 1.l within \n30 days. She noted SOR \u00b6 1.b is no longer reflected in her last credit report, but she \nprovided no documentary evidence to show that she paid the debt. She is now disputing \nthe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k for $158. Concerning SOR \u00b6 1.g for $5,082, she promised \nto contact the creditor and settle the debt.  \n \nApplicant does not appear to have the financial means to pay her legal \nobligations, delinquent debts, and her day-to-day living expenses. AG \u00b6 19(a): inability \nor unwillingness to satisfy debts; and AG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial \nobligations, apply.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nApplicant established circumstances beyond her control contributing to her \ninability to pay her debts, i.e., her periods of unemployment and underemployment; \nfrequent marital separations; a failed business; her husband\u2019s periods of unemployment \nand his inability to find a steady job; and her husband\u2019s failure to pay child support \nduring separations. I find AG \u00b6 20(b) applies, but does not fully mitigate the financial \nconcerns.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s evidence is not sufficient to show she acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. She presented little documentary evidence of debt payments, contacts \nwith creditors, settlement or negotiations of debts, or that she has properly disputed any \nof her debts. By her own admissions, Applicant\u2019s financial problems are related to her \nhaving the lifestyle of a two-income family, when in fact she has been the sole provider \nmost of the time. I also find she is financially overextended and her financial problems \nare not under control. She received a personal loan from her father to stop her truck \nfrom being repossessed, and she still is one month behind on her truck payment. As of \nher hearing date, she was one month behind on her electric and water bills. \n \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (c), (d), and (e) do not fully apply because Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems are not yet under control and her delinquent debts are likely to recur. She did \nnot receive financial counseling, submit a budget, or provide documentation disputing \nher debts. She also failed to show she made good-faith efforts to resolve her debts. AG \n\u00b6 20(f) does not fully apply.  \n \n \nDespite partial applicability of AG \u00b6 20(b), financial considerations concerns are \nnot mitigated. Applicant is financially overextended. She lacks the income to bring his \ndebts to current status. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n\n \n9 \n \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is attempting to correct her \nfinancial situation by contacting her creditors and making a budget commensurate with \nher one-family income. She resolved four debts totaling $29,023. She has successfully \nworked for defense contractors and the government in the past, and now as employee \nof a defense contractor for approximately 20 months. There is no evidence she has ever \ncompromised classified information or committed any security violations. Applicant \nexpressed remorse for her financial mistakes and promised to repay her creditors. She \nestablished circumstances beyond her control contributing to her inability to pay her \ndebts. These factors show responsibility, good judgment, and mitigation. \n \nNotwithstanding, Applicant has been continuously employed since April 2000, \nexcept for brief periods of unemployment from October 2004 to February 2005, and \nwhile in between jobs. She was underemployed during 2005, when she was self-\nemployed. She has worked for government contractors, or the government, since June \n2005 to the present. \n \n \nOn balance, I conclude Applicant presented insufficient evidence of having a \ntrack record of financial responsibility. She presented little documentary evidence of \nefforts to pay her financial obligations or to resolve her debts. There are no clear \nindications that her financial problem is being resolved or is under control. Her inability \nto pay even relatively small debts, her bouncing a check, having to obtain a loan to \nmake her truck payment; and being one month late on two utility bills show she is \nfinancially overextended. Her purchase of a large, luxury truck, albeit second hand, \nshows lack of judgment. She does not have the financial means to resolve her financial \nproblems. Applicant\u2019s favorable evidence is insufficient to mitigate the security concerns \narising under the financial considerations guideline.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.e,  \n \n \n \n   and 1.g and 1.k - 1.m: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f, and 1.h - 1.j:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant replied to the SOR by admitting one of the four delinquent debts ranging in amounts from $85 to $19,880 for a total of about $28,991. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence. Applicant is a 37-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has a bachelor\u2019s degree in secondary education, and he has worked as an instructor for a defense contractor since February 2008. He has been continuously employed since at least April 2001. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance for the first time. Applicant has a history of financial problems, which he attributes to a divorce (Tr. at 37). All four debts, as alleged in the SOR, are established by two credit reports (Exhibits 3 and 4). The status of the debts is summarized in the following table. Debts Status SOR \u00b6 1.a\u2013$8,306 deficiency balance stemming from an auto repossession. Applicant admits the debt, estimates the current balance at $9,375, and he has taken no action on the debt since the repossession in 2007. His plan is to address it when he settles his other financial matters (Tr. at 48). SOR \u00b6 1.b\u2013$720 collection account. Paid (Exhibit B). SOR \u00b6 1.c\u2013$19,880 charged-off account stemming from an auto repossession. Applicant disputes this debt.

Acting\nunder the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings\n1\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on December\n5, 2008. The SOR is equivalent to a complaint and it details the factual basis for the\naction. The issues here fall under Guideline F for financial considerations. \nJuly 29, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant replied to the SOR on December 22, 2008, and he requested a\nhearing. On February 6, 2009, the case was assigned to another judge who scheduled\nthe hearing for March 23, 2009. The hearing was cancelled, and the case was\nreassigned to me on May 1, 2009. The hearing took place on June 3, 2009. The\ntranscript (Tr.) was received on June 11, 2009. For the reasons discussed below, this\ncase is decided against Applicant.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant replied to the SOR by admitting one of the four delinquent debts\nranging in amounts from $85 to $19,880 for a total of about $28,991. Based on the\nrecord evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has a bachelor\u2019s\ndegree in secondary education, and he has worked as an instructor for a defense\ncontractor since February 2008. He has been continuously employed since at least April\n2001. He is seeking to obtain a security clearance for the first time. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems, which he attributes to a divorce (Tr.\nat 37). All four debts, as alleged in the SOR, are established by two credit reports\n(Exhibits 3 and 4). The status of the debts is summarized in the following table.\nDebts\nStatus\nSOR \u00b6 1.a\u2013$8,306 deficiency balance\nstemming from an auto repossession.\nApplicant admits the debt, estimates the\ncurrent balance at $9,375, and he has\ntaken no action on the debt since the\nrepossession in 2007. His plan is to\naddress it when he settles his other\nfinancial matters (Tr. at 48).\nSOR \u00b6 1.b\u2013$720 collection account.\nPaid (Exhibit B).\nSOR \u00b6 1.c\u2013$19,880 charged-off account\nstemming from an auto repossession.\nApplicant disputes this debt. He\nmaintains  it is from an auto loan\nobtained by his then wife in June 2005,\nwhich ended in repossession in 2006. He\ndenies signing the loan paperwork.\nCorrespondence from the bank is\naddressed to his wife (Exhibit 2). A March\n2008 credit report shows it was a joint\ninstallment account (Exhibit 4 at 15).\nSOR \u00b6 1.d\u2013$85 collection account.\nPaid (Exhibit B). \nApplicant married in March 2005, the couple separated after about six months,\nand they were only recently divorced in February 2009.

His ex-wife has custody of the\nchild, and Applicant is paying court-ordered child support at the rate of $656 monthly.\nAlso, the divorce degree ordered that \u201c[e]ach party shall pay all debts in his or her name\nand shall further pay any and all debts in his or her name after the service of process in\nthis matter dated December 28, 2005\" (Exhibit A). \nApplicant has a ten-year-old daughter from a previous relationship. He recently\nobtained custody of her after a custody dispute. \nApplicant estimates the divorce and custody cases have cost him from $10,000\nto $20,000. He is continuing to pay attorney\u2019s fees with a balance due of about $2,300. \nHis current annual salary is about $65,000. He reports a positive cash flow of\n$600 to $800 monthly (Tr. at 46). He participates in his company\u2019s 401(k) plan. Since\nthe divorce is now resolved, his finances have improved to the point where he is now\nliving comfortably.\nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, the only purpose of a security clearance\ndecision is to decide if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information.\nA favorable decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted a security\nclearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An unfavorable\n2\ndecision: (1) denies any application; (2) revokes any existing security clearance; and (3)\nprevents access to classified information at any level.  \n3\nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance.  And as\n4\nnoted by the Supreme Court in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive,\n5\nany doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.\n\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd. Mar. 23, 2004).\n6\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.14.\n7\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n8\n Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6 E3.1.15.\n9\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n10\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n11\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n12\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 13\u201314 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n13\nconditions). \n4\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n6\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n7\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n8\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n9\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.10\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.11\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. \nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to have a high degree\nof trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified\ninformation. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that the applicant has not met\n12\nthe strict guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for a security\nclearance.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  a security concern typically\n13\nexists due to significant unpaid debts. \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means,\nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\n\n Revised Guidelines at p. 13. \n14\n DC 1 is \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d \n15\n DC 3 is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \n16\n5\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation.\u201d  Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be\n14\nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and\nsafeguarding classified information.   \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems raises security concerns because it\nindicates inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts  and a history of not meeting\n15\nfinancial obligations  within the meaning of Guideline F. The record evidence shows\n16\nApplicant incurred delinquent debts based in part on repossession of at least one auto,\nwhich shows a high degree of financial irresponsibility. These facts and circumstances\nare more than sufficient to establish these two disqualifying conditions.  \nThe guideline also provides that certain conditions may mitigate security\nconcerns:\nMC 1\u2013the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\nMC 2\u2013the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\nMC 3\u2013the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\nMC 4\u2013the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts;\nMC 5\u2013the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; or \nMC 6\u2013the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n\n Revised Guidelines at pp. 1\u20132. \n17\n6\nAll of the mitigating conditions have been considered and three deserve\ndiscussion. First, MC 2 applies because Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties were due, in\npart, to expenses associated with the separation and divorce as well as the custody\ncase involving his ten-year-old daughter. He acted responsibly under the circumstances\nby putting family first. \nSecond, MC 4 applies, in part, because Applicant made a good-faith effort by\npaying off two collection accounts. Such actions demonstrate good faith.  \nThird, MC 5 applies, in part, because Applicant may have a reasonable basis to\ndispute the $19,880 charged-off account. Correspondence from the bank was\naddressed to his wife, which lends credibility to his claim that this is his wife\u2019s debt that\nshe is responsible for under the terms of the divorce. He does not receive full credit,\nhowever, because a credit report suggests the debt was based on a joint account, the\nrelevant paperwork he submitted is dated in 2006 and 2007, and the current status of\nthe dispute is unknown.  \nI also considered this case in light of the whole-person concept, which requires\nan administrative judge to evaluate a person\u2019s eligibility by considering the totality of the\nperson\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider\nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed in the Revised Guidelines as follows: (1) the\nnature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the\nconduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the\nconduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.  \n17\nApplicant is an educated and mature individual who should be able to handle his\nfinancial obligations without the difficulties he has experienced. At this time, his financial\nproblems are not overwhelming, and he is not in the middle of financial turmoil. He has\na good job and earns a decent salary. These circumstances weigh in his favor.\nBut Applicant has not displayed sufficient intensity to demonstrate that he is\nserious about cleaning up his financial house by resolving the two largest outstanding\ndebts set forth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.c. He presented no paperwork on the $8,306\ndeficiency balance stemming from an auto repossession. That is consistent with his\ntestimony that he has taken no action on it since the repossession in 2007. And he does\nnot have a realistic plan in place to address this debt in the near future. His paperwork\non the $19,880 charged-off account, which he disputes, is dated and does not report the\ncurrent status. Since the dispute commenced in 2006 or 2007, it is reasonable to expect\nto see some evidence of progress. For these two debts, taken together, it appears to be\na case of out-of-sight and out-of-mind. This suggests Applicant has a lackadaisical or\n\n7\napathetic attitude, which militates against a favorable decision. On balance, I am not\npersuaded that Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems is a thing of the past and will not\nbe an item of concern in the future. \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the security concerns under Guideline F. Applicant did not meet\nhis ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. This case is\ndecided against Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations, as required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of\nEnclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.c:\n \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraphs 1.b and 1.d:\n \nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.    \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on March 18, 2008. On October 24, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the \ngovernment\u2019s security concerns under Guideline C (Foreign Preference) and Guideline \nB (Foreign Influence).1 The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the \n \n1  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nApril 2, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                                          \npreliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him, and recommended \nreferral to an administrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be denied \nor revoked. \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 30, 2008, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on December 2, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on December 8, 2008, scheduling a hearing on \nJanuary 6, 2009. The hearing was conducted as scheduled. \n \nAt the hearing, the government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were \nadmitted without objection (Tr. 18). GE 4 is a government motion for me to take \nadministrative notice of facts regarding the government of Israel.2 Applicant testified on \nhis own behalf, and presented one exhibit (AE 1), which was admitted without objection \n(Tr. 21). DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on January 26, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted the factual allegations in the SOR allegations with some \ncorrections and explanations. His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a thorough review of all evidence of record, I make the following additional findings \nof fact.  \n \nApplicant is a 66-year-old business continuity planner working for a defense \ncontractor since January 2007. He was born, raised, and educated in the United States \nto U.S.-born parents (GE 1, Tr. 52). He served in the U.S. Air Force from 1960 to 1962. \nIn 1962, he received an early discharge \u201cfor the needs of the service\u201d (Tr. 23). He \nrefused to explain the reason behind his early discharge. His service was characterized \nas honorable. \n \nHe married his first wife in 1972, and they were divorced two years later. He has \nno children of this marriage (Tr. 27). In 1974, Applicant converted to Judaism (Tr. 71). In \nMay 1975, he relocated to Israel to learn Hebrew and to be able to read religious source \ndocuments (Tr. 28-32, 53). He was 32 years old. From May 1975 to May 1979, \nApplicant lived, worked, and studied in Israel. He worked and studied at a Kibbutz, \ntaught English at Israeli government schools, attended Israeli government sponsored \ncourses, and worked for an Israeli company that makes electronic products for the \nIsraeli military. He received a student stipend of approximately $5,000 from the Israeli \ngovernment. He believes he is not entitled to an Israeli retirement pension because of \nthe short period he worked in Israel. As an Israeli citizen, however, he is entitled to \n \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \n2  GE 4 was marked for identification and considered for administrative notice only. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nIsraeli government benefits, such as medical care, welfare, and economic benefits (Tr. \n80, 85-86).  \n \nDuring the first three years, Applicant lived in Israel as a temporary resident. At \nthe end of his third year, he was offered his Israeli citizenship and he accepted it. He did \nnothing to refuse it (Tr. 33). He believes that if he had asked for his Israeli citizenship he \nwould have jeopardized his U.S. citizenship. He did not want to jeopardize his U.S. \ncitizenship, and he took no affirmative action to ask for his Israeli citizenship. He also \nexplained that while living in lsrael, he did not vote, run for public office, or volunteer for \nthe Israeli army. He paid his U.S. taxes while in Israel.  \n \nIn 1976, Applicant met his wife in Israel and they were married in 1977 (Tr. 35). \nThey have three children of this marriage. His first son was born in Israel and is a dual \ncitizen of Israel and the United States (Tr. 36). Applicant returned to the United States in \nMay 1979, because he was disappointed with Israeli politics, could not buy milk for his \nnew born son, and the economic opportunities were better in the United States (AE 1). \nHis second son was born in the United States. Applicant believes he renounced his \nIsraeli citizenship, but does not know when or why. Applicant\u2019s 21-year-old daughter is a \ndual citizen of the United States and Israel. She moved to Israel in 2007, seeking \nadmission at an Israeli university (Tr. 26-27). She works part time in restaurants and \nteaches English. Applicant\u2019s daughter is marrying an Israeli citizen in February 2009 (Tr. \n25). According to Applicant, his future son-in-law is a 32-year-old teacher who is also a \nreservist in the Israeli Defense Forces. Applicant intends to travel to Israel for his \ndaughter\u2019s wedding (Tr. 55).  \n \nApplicant travelled to Israel in 1986, to celebrate his son\u2019s bar mitzvah with his \nIsraeli relatives (Tr. 43). In 2006, he travelled with his wife to visit with her mother and \nother immediate and extended family members who are residents and citizens of Israel \n(Tr. 44). Whenever they travel to Israel, Applicant and his family stay with his wife\u2019s \nrelatives. Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law was born in Morocco. She immigrated to Israel in \n1969 (Tr. 46). Applicant\u2019s wife talks to her mother every week. She talks to her two \nsisters, four brothers and other Israeli relatives approximately one or two times a month \n(Tr. 48). One of Applicant\u2019s sisters-in-law works for the Israeli Army as a civilian \nemployee. Two of his brothers-in-law work for the Israeli government: one is a clerk in \nthe city administration, and the other works for the agriculture department (Tr. 49).  \n \nHe has less contact than his wife with her mother, siblings, and other relatives \nbecause of his language limitation (Tr. 48). All of his Israeli relatives are aware \nApplicant is being considered for a national security position (Tr. 57). His wife became a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen in January 1987 (Tr. 40). Applicant and his wife intend to spend \nsix months of the year in Israel, and six months in the United States after he retires (at \nage 70) (Tr. 80). For that reason alone, he intends to retain his Israeli citizenship (AE 1). \n \nApplicant testified that he was never issued an Israeli passport (Tr. 50). He was \nissued an Israeli identification card and a one-year Israeli travel document to leave \nIsrael in 1979 (Tr. 79). He still has a valid Israeli identification card (Tr. 50-51). He was \n\n \n4 \n \n \nissued one-year Israeli travel documents to travel in and out of Israel in 1986 and 2006. \nHe used them in preference to his American passport. Both documents expired. He \nintends to obtain another Israeli travel document to travel to Israel for his daughter\u2019s \nwedding in 2009.  \n \nApplicant expressed displeasure at the security clearance process. He found it \ninsulting, and expressed the misconception that his loyalty to the United States was \nbeing questioned. He noted that at age 17 he volunteered to serve in the Air Force. He \nfurther stated: \u201cseeing the Stars and Stripes after four years overseas brought tears to \nmy eyes. Unlike most citizens, I know the value of this country and I am not about to \njeopardize its security.\u201d (GE 3). Applicant also stated that he is \u201cstill loathe to surrender \nhis Israeli citizenship\u201d (GE 3). \n \n \n \nI take administrative notice of the following facts. The government of Israel is a \nparliamentary democracy. The Israeli government generally respects the human rights \nof its citizens, but there are some issues with respect to treatment of Palestinian \ndetainees, conditions in some detention and interrogation facilities, and discrimination \nagainst Israel\u2019s Arab citizens. Since 1948, the United States and Israel have developed \na close friendship based on common democratic values, religious affinities, and security \ninterests. Israel has a diversified, technologically advanced economy and the United \nStates is Israel\u2019s largest trading partner. Since 1976, Israel has been the largest \nrecipient of U.S. foreign aid. The two countries also have very close security relations.   \n \n \nU.S. - Israeli bilateral relations are multidimensional and complex. Israel has \ngiven a high priority to gaining wide acceptance as a sovereign state and to ending \nhostilities with Arab forces. Israel and the United States participate in joint military \nplanning and combined exercises, and have collaborated on military research and \nweapons development. Commitment to Israel\u2019s security and well being has been a \ncornerstone of U.S. policy in the Middle East since Israel\u2019s creation in 1948, and the two \ncountries are bound closely by historic and cultural ties as well as mutual interests. \n \n \nNotwithstanding, there are several issues of concern regarding U.S. relations \nwith Israel. These include Israel\u2019s military sales to China, inadequate Israeli protection \nof U.S. intellectual property, and espionage-related cases. There are several cases of \nU.S. citizens convicted of selling, attempting to sell, or providing classified documents to \nIsraeli Embassy officials, as well as cases of Israeli nationals indicted for espionage.   \n \n \nIsrael is one of the most active collectors of proprietary information. Israeli \nmilitary officers have been implicated in this type of technology collection in the United \nStates. There have been cases involving the illegal export, or attempted illegal export, \nof U.S. restricted, dual use technology to Israel. \n \n \nThe theft of sensitive and proprietary information threatens U.S. national security \nin both military and economic terms, and it reveals the intelligence-gathering capabilities \nof foreign governments and foreign companies. Industrial espionage is intelligence-\ngathering \u201cconducted by a foreign government or by a foreign company with direct \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                     \nassistance of a foreign government against a private U.S. company for the purpose of \nobtaining commercial secrets.\u201d Industrial espionage is not limited to targeting \ncommercial secrets of a merely civilian nature, but rather can include the targeting of \ncommercial secrets that have military applications, sensitive technology that can be \nused to harm the United States and its allies, and classified information.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.3  \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d4 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \n \n3  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n4  Egan, supra, at 528, 531. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nForeign Preference \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 9 the security concern involving foreign preference arises, \u201c[w]hen \nan individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country over \nthe United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make \ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 10(a)(1) Applicant may be disqualified for the \u201cexercise of any right, \nprivilege or obligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen or through the \nforeign citizenship of a family member. This includes but is not limited to: (3) accepting \neducational, medical, retirement, social welfare, or other such benefits.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 \n10(b) Applicant may be disqualified for \u201caction to acquire or obtain recognition of a \nforeign citizenship by an American citizen.\u201d  \n \nApplicant was born in the United States to U.S. born parents. In 1975, he \ntravelled to Israel to study Hebrew under an Israeli government sponsored program, \nreceived an educational stipend from the Israeli government, and worked indirectly for \nthe Israeli government. After three years in Israel, he became an Israeli citizen. As of \nthe day of his hearing, he possessed an Israeli identification card. As an Israeli citizen, \nhe is entitled to Israeli travel documents and to Israeli government benefits. After he \nretires, he and his wife intend to live 50% of the time in Israel and 50% in the United \nStates. AG \u00b6\u00b6 10(a)(3) and 10(b) apply. \n \nAG \u00b6 11 provides six conditions that could mitigate the foreign preference \nsecurity concerns: \n \n(a) dual citizenship is based solely on parents' citizenship or birth in a \nforeign country; \n \n(b) the individual has expressed a willingness to renounce dual \ncitizenship; \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \n(c) exercise of the rights, privileges, or obligations of foreign citizenship \noccurred before the individual became a U.S. citizen or when the \nindividual was a minor; \n \n(d) use of a foreign passport is approved by the cognizant security \nauthority; \n \n(e) the passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant \nsecurity authority, or otherwise invalidated; and \n \n(f) the vote in a foreign election was encouraged by the United States \nGovernment. \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s security concerns arose, in part, out of his acquiring Israeli citizenship \nand his exercise of his dual citizenships with Israeli. In December 2008, Applicant stated \nhe would loathe surrendering his Israeli citizenship. At his hearing, Applicant expressed \nsimilar feelings, along with his intent to live in Israel, at least 50% of the time. Applicant \nhas travelled to Israel two or three times since 1979. In all his travels to Israel, he used \nhis Israeli travel document. He intends to travel on an Israeli travel document in \nFebruary 2009. As of his hearing day, Applicant enjoyed all the privileges and rights of \nIsraeli citizens, including the possession of a valid Israeli identification card, and the \nability to use Israeli travel documents.  \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n  \nUnder Guideline B, the government\u2019s concern is that:  \n \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, he or she may be \nmanipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or \ngovernment in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this \nGuideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign country in \nwhich the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not \nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to \ntarget United States citizens to obtain protected information and/or is \nassociated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 6.  \n \nAG \u00b6 7 sets out three conditions that raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n                                                     \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information; and \n \n(d) sharing living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in \na foreign country and an applicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is \nsufficient to create the potential for foreign influence and could potentially result in the \ncompromise of classified information.5 Applicant has frequent contacts and a close \nrelationship of affection and/or obligation with daughter and his in-laws who are Israeli \ncitizens residing in Israel. The closeness of the relationship is shown by Applicant\u2019s \nfrequent telephone contacts with them, directly or through his wife, the fact that he is \ntravelling back to Israel for his daughter\u2019s wedding, and the love, affection and/or \nobligation he expressed for his daughter and in-laws. \n \nThis contact creates a risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation because \nthere is always the possibility that Israeli agents may exploit the opportunity to obtain \nsensitive or classified U.S. information. Israel is one of the most active collectors of \nsensitive and proprietary information from the United States. Israeli military officers have \nbeen implicated in the collection in the United States of classified and proprietary \ntechnology. There have been cases involving the illegal export, or attempted illegal \nexport, of U.S. restricted, dual use technology to Israel.  \n \n  \nThe government produced substantial evidence raising these three potentially \ndisqualifying conditions (AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), (b), and (d)), and the burden shifted to Applicant to \nproduce evidence and prove a mitigating condition. The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the government. \n \n  \nSix Foreign Influence Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 8 are potentially \napplicable to these disqualifying conditions: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \n \n5  See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. \nBd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \nConsidering the record as a whole, I conclude that none of the mitigating \nconditions fully apply. Appellant did not establish it is unlikely he will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of his daughter and his in-laws and \nthe U.S. interests.  \n \nIn light of Israel\u2019s aggressive posture in the collection of sensitive and proprietary \ninformation in the United States, Applicant\u2019s close relationship with his daughter and in-\nlaws creates a risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion by the \nIsraeli government. His frequent contact and close relationship with his daughter and in-\nlaws could potentially force him to choose between the United States and Israeli \ninterests. \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) partially applies because Applicant is a U.S. born citizen. He served in \nthe Air Force two years, and except for the four years he lived in Israel, he has lived in \nthe United States all his life. However, AG \u00b6 8(b) does not mitigate the security \nconcerns raised. When balancing Applicant\u2019s favorable information against his acquiring \nIsraeli citizenship at age 32, his continuous exercise of Israeli dual citizenship, and his \nintent to live in Israel (albeit 50% of the year), there remains a potential conflict of \ninterest. \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior shows preference for Israel. His close contact with his \ndaughter and in-laws creates a risk of foreign exploitation because of the Israeli \ngovernment\u2019s active collection of sensitive U.S. economic, industrial, and proprietary \ninformation. Available information sustains a conclusion that there is a risk that the \nIsraeli government may attempt to exploit Applicant directly, or by exploiting Applicant\u2019s \nrelatives. Applicant\u2019s situation creates a potential conflict of interest between Applicant\u2019s \nobligations to protect sensitive information and his desire/obligation to help himself, or \nhis family were they under exploitation by a foreign interest. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nOn balance, Applicant\u2019s favorable information is summarized as follows. \nApplicant is a loyal and proud American. He served in the U.S. Air Force two years, and \nexcept for the four year period he lived in Israel, he has lived in the United States all his \nlife. Available evidence suggests he is a valuable employee of a government contractor \nproviding important services for government agencies. There is no evidence Applicant \nhas ever compromised or caused others to compromise classified information. There is \nno evidence he has ever taken any action which could cause potential harm to the \nUnited States, or that he lacks honesty and integrity.  \n \nOn the other hand, there are circumstances that weigh against Applicant in the \nwhole person analysis: Applicant received educational and economic benefits from the \nIsraeli government, and became an Israeli citizen. As of the day of his hearing, he was \nexercising several of the rights and privileges of an Israeli citizen, including possessing \nan Israeli identification card and access to Israeli travel documents. He also is entitled, \namong other benefits, to educational, medical, social welfare, and economic benefits \nfrom the Israeli government. After he retires, he and his wife intend to live 50% of the \n\n \n11 \n \n \ntime in Israel and the other half of the year in the United States. Applicant stated he \nwould \u201cloathe\u201d surrendering his Israeli citizenship.  \n \nConsidering the record as a whole, Applicant\u2019s behavior and close relationship \nwith his relatives in Israel raise a doubt about his preference for Israel over the United \nStates and create a risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation. \u201cBecause of the \nextreme sensitivity of security matters, there is a strong presumption against granting a \nsecurity clearance. Whenever any doubt is raised . . .  it is deemed best to err on the \nside of the government\u2019s compelling interest in security by denying or revoking [a] \nclearance.\u201d Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990).  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate \nthe foreign preference and foreign influence security concerns arising from his \nbecoming an Israeli citizen, exercising his Israeli citizenship, and his relationship and \ncontacts with Israeli citizens and residents. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.f: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline C:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a, 2.e, \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nand 2.f: \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.b-2.d: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nJUAN J.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nMay 14, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on February 13, 2008 (Government Exhibit 1).  On October 30, 2008, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR)\ndetailing the security concerns under Guideline F concerning the Applicant.  The action\nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within\nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant filed an Answer to the SOR on October 10, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed\non December 11, 2008.  I received the case assignment on December 16, 2008.  DOHA\nissued a notice of hearing on January 6, 2009, setting the hearing for February 9, 2009.\nThe hearing was held on that date. \n\n2\nAt the hearing, the Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 5, which\nwere received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and submitted\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A through M, without objection.  DOHA received the transcript of the\nhearing on February 19, 2009.  The record closed on that date.  Based upon a review of\nthe case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nThe Applicant is 44 and married.  He has been married three times before.  The\nApplicant is employed by a defense contractor and seeks to retain a security clearance\npreviously granted in connection with his employment.\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is financially\noverextended and therefore at risk of engaging in illegal acts to generate funds.  The\nApplicant denied all of the allegations under this guideline.\nThe Applicant states that most of the debts involved in the SOR concern his third\nwife.  They were married in May 2001 and divorced in December 2002.  He testified that\nthe two of them opened up a computer retail store.  \u201cIn 2002, my wife left, took all the\ncash in the bank account, both personal and business, took half the business assets\nand products out of the store, and I was left with a business which was not doing very\nwell at the time, half the inventory and no operating capital.\u201d  (Transcript at 28.)  The\nApplicant also submitted that his third wife opened credit card accounts in his name\nwithout his permission, and that for several years he has been fighting with the creditors\nand the credit reporting agencies regarding the validity of these accounts.  (Transcript at\n29-30.)\nSubparagraph 1.a.  The Applicant consistently denies that he owes a creditor\n$8,461.00, for a vehicle repossession.  He maintains that the vehicle was only in his\nthird wife\u2019s name, and she allowed the vehicle to be repossessed.  He has continually\ndisputed in writing the validity of this debt.  The most recent credit reports provided by\nthe Government and the Applicant do not show this account.  (Government Exhibit 2 at\n3 and Exhibit 4; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E, Exhibit F and Exhibit G; Transcript at 32.)  \nSubparagraph 1.b.  The Applicant consistently denies that he owes a creditor\n$2,313.00 for a credit card.  He maintains that the credit card was only in his third wife\u2019s\nname.  He has continually disputed the validity of this debt in writing.  After an\ninvestigation by the credit reporting agency, this debt was deleted in January 2009.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit M.)  The most recent credit reports provided by the Government and\nthe Applicant do not show this account.  They do show two other accounts with the\nsame creditor, both of which are current.  (Government Exhibit 4; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E,\nExhibit F, Exhibit G at 7-8; Transcript at 32.) \n\n3\nSubparagraph 1.c. The Applicant consistently denies that he owes a creditor\n$175.00 for an unknown account, which may be a payroll advance.  He maintains that\nhe has no knowledge of this debt or what it is for.  He has continually disputed the\nvalidity of this debt in writing.  The most recent credit reports provided by the\nGovernment and the Applicant do not show this account.  (Government Exhibit 4;\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibit G; Transcript at 33-35, 49.) \nSubparagraph 1.d.  The Applicant consistently denies that he owes a creditor\n$3,235.00 for a credit card.  He maintains that he has no knowledge of this debt or what\nit is for.  Further, the Applicant states he never had a credit card issued by this entity.\nHe has continually disputed the validity of this debt in writing.  The collection agency\ninvestigated the debt, closed out the account and submitted to have their credit line\ndeleted from the Applicant\u2019s credit report.  In addition, after an investigation by the credit\nreporting agency, this debt was deleted in January 2009. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit K and\nExhibit M.)  The most recent credit reports provided by the Government and the\nApplicant do not show this account.  (Government Exhibit 4; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G;\nTranscript at 35-36.) \nSubparagraph 1.e.  The Applicant consistently denies that he owes a creditor\n$917.00 for a credit card.  He has continually disputed the validity of this debt in writing.\nThe most recent credit reports reflect no past due amount and state, \u201cConsumer\ndisputes after resolution.\u201d  The Applicant has another account with the same creditor,\nwhich is current.  (Government Exhibit 4; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G; Transcript at 36-37.) \nSubparagraph 1.f.  The Applicant denies that he currently owes $2,128.00 on a\ncredit card debt.  He has stated that this debt was a joint debt with his third wife.  The\nApplicant testified that he paid approximately $1,000.00 on this account.  (Transcript 37-\n38, 42.)  In September 2009, the Applicant requested in writing that this creditor validate\nthat there was a current debt owed by the Applicant.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E and Exhibit\nF.)  The debt has been removed from the most recent credit reports submitted by the\nGovernment and the Applicant.  (Government Exhibit 4; Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G.)\nThe Applicant submitted evidence that his current credit history is good.  He and\nhis fourth wife have purchased a house, and he is current on that debt as well as others.\nThe Applicant and his wife both make good salaries.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B, Exhibit C\nand Exhibit D.)  He is able to maintain all of his payments on his indebtedness, and\nhave money left over at the end of the month.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A and Exhibit G;\nTranscript at 43-46.)  \nMitigation\nThe Applicant has worked for his current employer for a year as of the time the\nrecord closed.  His performance evaluation shows that he is a \u201cSuccessful Contributor.\u201d\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit J.) \nThe Applicant\u2019s Lead submitted a statement acknowledging that the Applicant\nfully disclosed his past credit history.  Even so, he describes the Applicant is described\n\n4\nas a person who is \u201ctrustworthy\u201d and an \u201cintegral part of the team.\u201d  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\nI.)\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\nApplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the Administrative Judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access\nto classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.  In addition, the Administrative Judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the Applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n\n5\n \nFinally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Section 7 of Executive Order\n10865, \u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. AG \u00b6\n19(a) states that an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d may be disqualifying.\nThe Applicant refuses to pay these debts because they are not his.  Under AG & 19(c),\nAa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise security concerns. The\nApplicant denies owing most of the debts in the SOR.  A credit report is not definitive\nevidence of the existence of a debt, but it is substantial evidence.  Thus, the evidence is\nsufficient to raise this potentially disqualifying condition, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ In addition, AG\n\u00b6 20(b) states that it may be mitigating if \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial\nproblems were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d  Finally, \u00b6 20(e) applies\nwhere, \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due\ndebts which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate\nthe basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d\nThe Applicant\u2019s third wife left him in a precarious financial state when she left him\nand their business, taking the available money and half the inventory.  As described at\nlength above, the Applicant has consistently disputed the validity of debts he believes\nare his ex-wife\u2019s, and has done so in an appropriate manner.  Specifically, he has asked\n\n6\nthe creditors for validation of the debt, and filed repeated disputes with the credit\nreporting agencies.  Based on his actions, the creditors and/or credit reporting agencies\nhave deleted the credit lines for five of the six creditors.  The sixth creditor does not\nshow a past due amount as of the date of the hearing.  I find the behavior occurred\nunder such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur, and it does not raise\nconcerns about his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. The evidence\nraises these potential mitigating conditions.\nIt is also worth noting that the Applicant makes a good living, owns a house, and\nis current on all of his own debt payments.  This is not the case of a deadbeat who\nrefuses to pay his just debts, but a person who has a legitimate dispute with creditors\nand has attempted over many years to resolve it.  He is respected by his employers,\nand has been forthcoming with them about his debt situation. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b62(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b62(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for\na security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  The Applicant got into financial\ndifficulty because of his divorce from his third wife, and because of her actions in\nrunning up accounts using his name.  He has worked hard over a number of years to\nresolve these situations, and has done so successfully.  He has behaved reasonably\nand appropriately in trying to resolve his debts, thereby AG \u00b6 2(a)(6) applies.  Under the\nparticular circumstances of this case, I find that there is little to no potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b62(a)(8)), and that the likelihood of recurrence is\nclose to nil (AG \u00b62(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations.  Paragraph 1 is found for the Applicant.  He is currently eligible for a\nsecurity clearance.\n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.f.:\nFor the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant is 39 years old and has been a security monitor for a defense contractor since June 2007. Prior to obtaining that job, she worked at various occupations. She has an associate's degree in business. Applicant entered active duty in the Navy after completing high school, and served four years as a storekeeper and postal clerk. She was honorably discharged as a seaman (E-3) in September 1992. Applicant completed a Personal Financial Statement in response to interrogatories.

Jeffreys, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for Investigation Processing (e-QIP) on \nAugust 28, 2007.  On January 16, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) for Applicant detailing security concerns \nfor financial considerations under Guideline F.  The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 10, 2009. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 15, 2009.  She denied seven and \nadmitted twelve of the allegations under Guideline F with explanations.  Some of the \ndenials were for medical delinquent debts which Applicant claimed should have been \npaid by state medical coverage.  Applicant also notes she did not know about most of \nthe other debts.  Some of these unknown debts she admitted and some she denied.  \nThere does not seem to be a pattern or consistency in deciding which were admitted \n \n1 \n \n \nJuly 24, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nand which were denied.  She requested a hearing before an administrative judge.  \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on April 6, 2009, and the case was \nassigned to me on April 28, 2009.  DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on May 20, 2009, \nfor a hearing on June 10, 2009.  I convened the hearing as scheduled.  The government \noffered five exhibits, marked Government Exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 5, which were \nreceived without objection.  Applicant testified on her behalf.  Applicant offered four \nexhibits, marked Applicant Exhibits (App. Ex.) A through D, which were received without \nobjection.  The record was held open at Applicant's request so she could submit \nadditional documents.  Applicant timely submitted four documents marked Applicant \nExhibits E through H, which were received without objection (See, Gov. Ex 6, \nMemorandum, dated July 9, 2009). DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nJune 25, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and \ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nApplicant signed for the Notice of Hearing on June 1, 2009.  Applicant is entitled \nto 15 days notice of hearing (Directive E3.1.8).  Applicant discussed with Department \nCounsel the hearing date of June 10, 2009, prior to the mailing of a Notice of Hearing. \nAccordingly, actual notice was given more than 15 days prior to the hearing.  However, \nApplicant signed for the Notice of Hearing only 10 days prior to the hearing.  She \nwaived the 15 days notice requirement (Tr. 6). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing essential findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is 39 years old and has been a security monitor for a defense \ncontractor since June 2007.  Prior to obtaining that job, she worked at various \noccupations.  She has an associate's degree in business.  Applicant entered active duty \nin the Navy after completing high school, and served four years as a storekeeper and \npostal clerk.  She was honorably discharged as a seaman (E-3) in September 1992.  \nApplicant completed a Personal Financial Statement in response to interrogatories.  \nShe reported net monthly income of $2,147, and total monthly expenses of $2,061 \nwhich included a payment on student loans and payment on another loan.  She has a \nmonthly net remainder of less that $100.  Applicant confirmed her income and expenses \nat the hearing (Tr. 29-39, 43-44, 51-53; Gov. Ex. 1, E-QIP, dated August 28, 2007; Gov. \nEx. 2, Answer to Interrogatories, dated October 20, 2008 at 4).  \n \nApplicant married her first husband in January 1989 and they divorced in March \n1994.  He was to pay child support for their two children but he only paid intermittently \n(See. App. Ex. A, Payment records, dated May 8, 2009).  Applicant married again in \nMay 2002 but separated in 2005.  Her second husband provides no support for his son, \nher third child (Tr. 40-42). \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant was fortunate to have financial support from her parents after her \ndivorce.  Her mother sent her $200 bi-weekly for her and the children.  However, her \nmother became sick in 2000, had to stop working, and could no longer afford to assist \nApplicant financially.  Applicant began having financial troubles after her parents could \nno longer assist her financially.  Her mother passed away in 2005 (App. Ex. B, Obituary, \ndated September 2, 2005).  Five months later, her father passed away (Tr. 15-17, 19-\n21).   \n \nCredit reports (Gov. Ex. 3, credit report, dated April 28, 2009; Gov. Ex. 4, credit \nreport, dated September 29, 2008; and Gov. Ex. 5, credit report, dated September 22, \n2007) list a Chapter 13 bankruptcy filed in July 1999.  The credit reports also show that \nApplicant had the following delinquent debts; an account in collection for $168 (SOR \n1.b); an account in collection for $28 (SOR 1.c); five medical debts in collection for $69 \n(SOR 1.d), $46 (SOR 1.e), $41 (SOR 1.f), $135 (SOR 1.g), and $50 (SOR 1.h); a \ncollection account for $297 (SOR 1.i); a collection account for $647 (SOR 1.j); another \ncollection account for $2,038 (SOR 1.k); a collection account for $593 (SOR 1.l) a \ncollection account to a store for $209 (SOR 1.m); a collection account of $17,016 for the \nremainder on a repossessed mobile home (SOR 1.n); a collection account for $372 \n(SOR 1.o); and four collection accounts to the same creditor for $89 (SOR 1.p), $256 \n(SOR 1.q), $78 (SOR 1.r), and $215 (SOR 1.s).  The total listed delinquent debt is \n$22,317, the majority being for the repossessed mobile home.  Approximately $979 is \nfor medical debt not the responsibility of Applicant. \n \nApplicant filed for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 1999.  Applicant asked that the \ncase be dismissed because she could not make the required payments (Tr. 24-26; App. \nEx. D, Bankruptcy Dismissal, dated March 30, 2000).  She remembers making \npayments to her lawyer but not to the bankruptcy trustee.   \n \nApplicant's children's health costs are covered by the state Medicaid system \nsince Applicant's income is sufficiently low to qualify for such benefits for a family of \nfour.  In her answer to interrogatories, Applicant presented documentation that her \nchildren's medical expenses were covered by state Medicaid (Gov. Ex. 2, Answer to \nInterrogatories, dated October 20, 2008 at 16-19).  Applicant's personal medical care is \nprovided by the Veteran's Administration at no cost to her.  She had only one \nemergency procedure for kidney stones at a civilian health facility that may have been \ncharged to her (Tr. 44-46, 57-58, 68-71).   \n \nApplicant had never seen her credit report and was unaware of most of the debts \nlisted.  She could not identify most of the debts, their origin, or the creditors. Before the \nhearing, she made no inquiries into the status of the debts.  The credit report was \ndiscussed during the hearing.  The only debt she could positively acknowledge was the \nlargest debt in collection for Green Tree for $17,016 (SOR 1.n).  When Applicant was \nreceiving financial assistance from her parents, she purchased a mobile home in May \n1995.  When she stopped receiving financial assistance and no longer had sufficient \nfinances to pay the mortgage, she gave up the mobile home, and it was repossessed \nand sold in November 1999.  The debt is for the remainder of the loan.  She has not \n\n \n4 \n \n \nmade payments on the debt since she left the mobile home.  She has not contacted the \ncreditor to make payment arrangements (Tr. 48-49, 59-71). \n \nAt the hearing, each debt was discussed with Applicant, and she was advised \nhow to read the report and determine contact information for creditors listed on the \nreport.  After the hearing, she provided information on her attempts to resolve some of \nher debts.  She verified that some of the debts were medical debts.  She was unable to \nresolve any other debts or make arrangements by phone.  She drafted letters to send to \nthe creditors but she did not state that the letters had been sent (App. Ex. E, F, G, H, \nLetters, dated July 9, 2009).  \n \nApplicant had a loan from a state credit union that was paid in full.  That account \nis not listed as delinquent in the SOR.  She also has kept current with some other debts.  \nAt one time, she could not afford a place to live with her children and was taken in by a \nfriend (Tr. 23-24, 50-51; App. Ex. C, Account transaction, dated May 6, 2009).   \n \nApplicant's friend testified that she has known Applicant for over 20 years.  \nApplicant and her children moved in with her when Applicant lost her home and she and \nher children were homeless.  They split the cost of food and other necessities.  She \nknew Applicant's mother and knew that the mother assisted Applicant financially.  She \ndid see a change in Applicant's lifestyle when her mother became sick and could no \nlonger assist Applicant with funds.  She knows Applicant is a good person and well \nmeaning (Tr. 71-78). \n \nApplicant's oldest son testified that he had a decent life growing up because of \nthe support from his grandmother.  He and his sister visited her almost every summer.  \nHis grandparents provided them with books and clothes.  When his grandmother \nbecame sick, their financial problems started.  The worst problem was losing their \nhouse and having to live in a hotel until taken in by his mother's friend.  His mother is a \ngood parent who does her best to provide for her children (Tr. 78-84).   \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision.  According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  The administrative judge must consider all available, \n\n \n5 \n \n \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The \ngovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations: \n \n \nUnder financial considerations, failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds (AG \u00b6 18).  Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to \nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms.  Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance.  An applicant is not required to be \n\n \n6 \n \n \ndebt free, but is required to manage her finances in such a way as to meet her financial \nobligations.  Applicant's delinquent debts as admitted by Applicant and listed on the \ncredit reports are a security concern raising financial consideration disqualifying \nconditions (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), and FC DC \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations).  These delinquent debt \nproblems started as early as 1999 and still have not been resolved.  Applicant has taken \nno action to learn about or resolve the debts. This shows that Applicant has a history of \nan inability or unwillingness to meeting financial obligations.  Since bankruptcy is a legal \nand permissible means of resolving debt and the bankruptcy action was dismissed over \nnine years ago, it does not have any security significance (SOR 1.a). \n \n \nI considered the financial considerations mitigating conditions (FC MC) raised by \nApplicant's testimony.  FC MC AG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) \ndoes not apply.  Applicant has taken no action to pay the delinquent debts, so the debts \nare current.  The debts are from various sources, credit cards, loans, phone bills, and \nmobile home repossession, so they are not infrequent.  Since the debts are current and \nnot paid, they cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment.  The mitigating condition does not apply. \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problems \nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation) and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances).  Applicant started experiencing \nfinancial problems when her mother became sick and could no longer afford to \nsupplement her income.  She had two children at the time and no support from the \nchildren's father.  Her mother's sickness and the father's failure to support are \nconditions that are beyond her control.  However, Applicant presented no information to \nshow she acted responsibly under the circumstances.  Applicant was unaware of her \ndebts and the status of her finances.  She had never seen a copy of her credit report \nand did not know the extent of debt or the identity of creditors.  There is no indication \nshe sufficiently changed her lifestyle to reflect less support from her mother.  She did \nhave to move out of her house and it was repossessed but she received support from a \nfriend.  \n \n \nWhile Applicant did have life circumstances that caused financial issues, they \nwere not problems that could not be overcome with responsible action.  The first would \nhave been to know the status of her finances and adjust to her circumstances.  \nApplicant presented no information that she took action to live within her means after \nlosing the support of her mother.  Since she did not even look at her credit report or \nlearn the status of her finances, even after being questioned by security investigators, \nshe did not make any attempts to pay her delinquent debts since she has been steadily \nemployed in her present position.  Most of the delinquent debts were small.  Applicant \ncould have taken some action to challenge the medical debts and pay other small debts \nif she had made inquiries about her debts.  She was negligent and irresponsible \n\n \n7 \n \n \ntowards her finances.  She has not established she acted responsibly in managing her \nfinances and making payments on her obligations. \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(d) \"the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\".  For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, \nthere must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d of a \ngood-faith effort to repay.  A systematic, concrete method of handling debts is needed.  \nApplicant established that her children's medical expenses were covered by state \nMedicaid.  She established her medical expenses were covered by the Veteran's \nAdministration.  The medical debts should not have been assigned or allocated to \nApplicant.  Other than medical debts, Applicant has presented no evidence that the \nother debts in the SOR have been resolved.  She did present some information \nconcerning other debts that she resolved.  She did not make any attempts to contact \ncreditors and resolve debt until after the hearing.  Since some of the debts are for small \namounts, she may have been able to clear them if she had made an attempt to do so.  \nShe has not presented a concrete plan to pay her delinquent debts or established any \nattempt to pay them.  A stated future intention to pay debts is not sufficient to establish \na good-faith effort to pay debts.  Applicant has not presented sufficient information to \nindicate a good-faith effort to pay creditors or resolve debts.  Her finances are not under \ncontrol and she has not acted responsibly.  She has not presented sufficient information \nto mitigate security concerns for financial considerations. \n \n \u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  I considered Applicant's four years \nof honorable service on active duty in the Navy.  I considered that Applicant did not \nreceive support from the fathers of her children.  Applicant is a good-intended, well-\n\n \n8 \n \n \nmeaning person who is trying to provide for her family.  However, she has little if any \nknowledge about the status of her finances.  She was questioned by security \ninvestigators about her finances and took no action thereafter to inquire about the debts \nand take action.  By the time of the hearing, she had not even taken steps to seek \nfinancial counseling, learn the identity of creditors, how to contact them, and resolve her \ndelinquent debts.  Her lack of action towards her finances is irresponsible, careless, and \nunconcerned.  This leads to a determination that she is untrustworthy, unreliable, and \nexercises bad judgment.  Since she exhibits these traits toward her finances, it is \nreasonable that she will exhibit the same traits towards the safeguarding of classified \ninformation.  Her lack of actions to resolve her debts indicates poor self control, lack of \njudgment, and an unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations.  Overall, on balance \nthe record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns arising from financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.p:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.q:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.r:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.s:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Jeffreys, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for Sensitive Position (SF 86) as part of his \nemployment with a defense contractor on April 8, 2008. On February 12, 2009, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nfor Applicant detailing security concerns for financial considerations under Guideline F. \nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. Applicant \nacknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 14, 2009. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in an undated written response. He denied four and \nadmitted ten of the allegations under Guideline F with explanations. He claimed most of \nthe delinquent debts were caused by a business failure and an inability to work because \nof sickness and injury. He requested a hearing before an administrative judge. \nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on May 15, 2009, and the case was \n \n1 \n \n \nAugust 12, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nassigned to me on May 18, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on May 20, 2009, \nfor a hearing on June 11, 2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled. The government \noffered five exhibits, marked Government Exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 5, which were \nreceived without objection. Applicant testified on his behalf, and offered 14 exhibits, \nmarked Applicant Exhibits (App. Ex.) A through N, which were received without \nobjection. The record was held open at Applicant's request so he could submit \nadditional documents. Applicant timely submitted nine documents marked Applicant \nExhibits O through W, which were received without objection except for App. Ex. U, a \nhandwritten statement to Department Counsel by Applicant. The information in App. Ex. \nU restates information in other documents or from Applicant's testimony at the hearing. \nHis comments will be considered (Gov. Ex 6, Memorandum, dated July 9, 2009). DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on June 25, 2009. Based upon a review of \nthe case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nApplicant signed for the Notice of Hearing on May 29, 2009. Applicant is entitled \nto 15 days notice of hearing (Directive E3.1.8). Applicant discussed with Department \nCounsel the hearing date of June 11, 2009, prior to the mailing of a Notice of Hearing. \nAccordingly, actual notice was given more than 15 days prior to the hearing.  However, \nApplicant signed for the Notice of Hearing only 14 days prior to the hearing. He waived \nthe 15 days notice requirement (Tr. 6). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nAfter a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the \nfollowing essential findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is 42 years old and has been a cable inspector for a defense contractor \nsince February 2009. He started working for the defense contractor in February 2008 as \nan electronics technician in Iraq. Applicant served for almost three years on active duty \nin the Air Force as an aircraft maintenance specialist. He was honorably discharged as \nan airman first class in May 1988. Applicant was married in December 2004 and \ndivorced in March 2006. There were no children from the marriage, and he has not \nremarried. \n \nApplicant completed a Personal Financial Statement in response to \ninterrogatories. He noted that he receives $1,200 monthly in salary, $1,200 monthly in \nworkman's compensation, and $782 monthly in Veteran's Administration disability for a \ntotal monthly net compensation of $3,182. His expenses are approximately the same as \nhis income so he has no discretionary funds available at the end of the month (Tr. 41-\n50; Gov. Ex. 1, SF 86, dated April 9, 2008; Gov. Ex. 3, Answers to Interrogatories, \ndated December 2, 2008 at I9; App. Ex. C, DD Form 214, dated May 1988). \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant stated he owned at least two businesses at different times in the past \nand that he is a good business man. He sold the businesses for little profit but had no \ndebt left over. After these businesses were terminated, Applicant worked for a company \nas an engine technician. He became sick in April 2006 with a gastrointestinal issue. \nPrior to becoming sick, his performance at the business was good (App. Ex. D, Letter, \ndated December 3, 2006). After extensive testing, the doctors were unable to reach a \ndiagnosis. He was unable to work for approximately ten months. He did not receive \nworkman's compensation or other payments during this time. His lack of work and \nincome caused financial issues and debt problems for Applicant. He was unable to pay \nthe first and second mortgage on his house and it was subsequently foreclosed (Tr. 25-\n26; 41-44; 51-53; App. Ex. I, Medical records, dated September 12, 2006).  \n \nApplicant moved to another location after sufficiently recovering from his illness. \nSince he owned businesses in the past, he tried to start a silk screen printing business. \nHe arranged purchase of equipment and supplies from an acquaintance that already \nhad a silk screen printing business. Applicant states that he used approximately \n$30,000 of his own funds for the business and borrowed over $80,000. Applicant did not \npresent any information to show the amount of his own funds used for the business. \nApplicant was never able to establish a profitable silk screen printing business. \n \nApplicant's attempt at the silk screen business failed so he entered into an \nemployment contract with his defense contractor employer to work in Iraq as an \nelectronics technician on a government contract (App. Ex. L, Memorandum Contract, \ndated February 22, 2008). Applicant's salary was over $77,000 yearly (App. Ex. J, Pay \nstatement, dated April 25, 2008; App. Ex. K, Hourly earnings statement, undated; App. \nEx. S, Time sheet, dated June 6, 2008). Applicant's performance for his defense \ncontractor employer has been good. He received a letter of appreciation for his work on \na government project (App. Ex. F, Letter, dated May 6, 2008).  \n \nAfter being in Iraq for about 90 days, Applicant was injured in a fall. He was \nreturned to the United States for treatment, and is still recovering. He was cleared to \nwork  half days for the contractor in February 2009 (Tr. 25-27, 41-45, 51-59; Gov. Ex. 2, \nAnswer to SOR, dated January 2, 2009; App. Ex. G, Medical Report, dated April 26, \n2008). ). His performance of duty was rated as professional and proficient and he was \nrecommended for pay increases (App. Ex. M, Performance review, dated February \n2009). \n \nCredit reports examined during a security investigation after Applicant submitted \nhis SF 86 show the following delinquent debts: a credit card debt placed for collection \nby a bank for $15,575 (SOR 1.a); a leasing account placed for collection for $21,837 \n(SOR 1.b); a credit card debt charged off for $2,248 (SOR 1.c); a credit card debt \ncharged off for $9,984 (SOR 1.d); a credit card debt charged off for $3,414 (SOR 1.e); a \nfurniture store account charged off for $5,630 (SOR 1.f); a credit card debt charged off \nfor $3,697 (SOR 1.g); a credit card debt charged off for $10,297 (SOR 1.h); another \ncredit card account charged off for $28,427 (SOR 1.i); a credit card debt placed for \ncollection for $944(SOR 1.j); a second mortgage on a house past due for $5,026 on a \n\n \n4 \n \n \nbalance of $29,716 (SOR 1.k); the first mortgage on the same house placed for \ncollection or foreclosure for $118,000; a debt for a motorcycle past due for $2,577 on a \nbalance of $14,301 (SOR 1.m); and a store charge past due for $250 on a balance of \n$820 (SOR 1.n; Gov. Ex. 4, Credit report, dated December 23, 2008; Gov. Ex. 5, Credit \nreport, dated May 8, 2008). \n \nThe credit card at SOR 1.a was used by Applicant for expenses after he moved \nand was trying to establish the silk screen business. He made some payments on the \ncard but does not remember the number of payments or amount. He contacted the bank \nfor a settlement but the bank required a lump sum payment. He was unable to make the \npayment (Tr. 28-31. \n \nA friend of Applicant's had a silk screen printing business in his basement. \nApplicant purchased the business from the friend, and agreed to lease the machine \nfrom a supplier. He used funds obtained from credit cards to purchase the business. \nThe friend was to permit Applicant to continue to house the machine in his basement \nand train him in the business. The debt at SOR 1.b is with the supplier for the lease of \nthe machine and some supplies. SOR debts 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, and 1.j are credit \ncard debts also used to purchase supplies and equipment. Applicant worked at the \nbusiness and it was starting to develop. He made some payments to the supplier and to \ncreditors for credit cards. After six or seven months, the friend would not permit \nApplicant to use the machine or remove it from the house. The supplier was to retrieve \nthe equipment, but his friend would not let the supplier into the house to inspect or \nremove the machine. None of these accounts have been paid (Tr. 31-37, 53-55; App. \nEx. B, Invoice, dated November 15, 2006). Applicant claims he talked to some of the \ncreditors, but he presented no information to show he discussed the debts with them \n(Tr. 35-36, 54-55). \n \nThe debt at SOR 1.f is for furniture Applicant purchased for his house when he \nmoved to the location of his silk screen business and where he is now employed. There \nare no indications of any payment on this debt.  \n \nThe mortgage debts at SOR 1.k, and 1.l are mortgages on the house he \npurchased in 2005 at his former location. He left the house in 2007 when he moved. He \nstated he made payments on the mortgages prior to moving. Applicant sought \nforbearance of his loan. The information he presented is an application for forbearance \nand does not indicate that an agreement was reached. However, his attorney noted that \nthe forbearance was executed on May 1, 2008.  Applicant was in Iraq at the time. He \nwas unable to make the forbearance payments when he lost his job because of injury. \nThe house was foreclosed in January 2009. His attorney notes there is no deficiency on \nthe loan after the foreclosure (Tr. 35-38, 58-59; App. Ex. H, Forbearance Documents, \nundated; App. Ex. W, Attorney's letter, dated July 7, 2009). \n \nSOR debt 1.m is for a motorcycle. The motorcycle was sold by a friend for \nApplicant while he was in Iraq. The debt has been paid (Tr. 39-40, 59-61; App. Ex. V, \n\n \n5 \n \n \nPaid in full letter, dated June 11, 2009). SOR debt 1.n is a store credit account debt. \nApplicant has not inquired about the debt or paid it (Tr. 40-41, 60). \n \nApplicant has a workman's compensation claim against his employer based on \nhis injury in Iraq (App. Ex. O, Attorney Letter, dated June 12, 2009; App. Ex. P, \nMemorandum of Informal Conference, dated January 8, 2009; App. Ex. Q, Labor \nDepartment pre-hearing statement, dated February 6, 2009; App. Ex. R, Request for \ncompensation, undated; App. Ex. T, Statement of contested issues, dated April 22, \n2009). Applicant expects to file a complaint against the friend who was to assist him in \nopening the silk screen business. Applicant's intent is to use the funds from his \nworkman's compensation claim and the proceeds, if any, from the claim for the silk \nscreen business to pay his delinquent debts (Tr. 50-51, 63-66). \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \n\n \n6 \n \n \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations \n \n \nUnder financial considerations, failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds (AG \u00b6 18). Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to \nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations. Applicant's delinquent debts from credit cards, loans, and past due \nmortgage debt as admitted by Applicant and listed on the credit reports are a security \nconcern raising financial consideration disqualifying conditions (FC DC) AG \u00b6 19(a) \n(inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts), and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations). These delinquent debt problems started as early as 2006 \nand still have not been resolved. Applicant has taken little action to learn about or \nresolve the debts. This shows that Applicant has a history, inability, or unwillingness to \nmeeting financial obligations. \n \n \nI considered the financial considerations mitigating conditions (FC MC) that were \nraised by Applicant's testimony. FC MC AG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long \nago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment) does not apply. Applicant has taken no action to pay the delinquent debts, so \nthe debts are current. There are a number of debts from credit cards and other loans, so \nApplicant has extensive delinquent debt issues. The circumstances of how the debts \narose are not unusual and they can recur. Since the debts are not paid, they cast doubt \non Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment.   \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nI considered FC MC AG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial \nproblems were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation) \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances). Applicant's financial \nproblems started when he became ill with gastrointestinal problems in 2005. He was \nunable to work for ten months, could not pay his mortgage, and had to move to start a \nbusiness. His financial problems continued when his new business did not succeed. His \nproblems were exacerbated when he took a job in Iraq, was injured, and had to return \nand could work only part time. Applicant's illness, injury, and failed business contributed \nto his financial problems. However, there are indications he did not act responsibly \nunder the circumstances. Applicant indicated he opened the silk screen printing \nbusiness with $30,000 of his own funds and borrowed about $80,000 using credit cards. \nHowever, just before opening the business, he was unemployed for ten months and \nunable to pay his mortgage. He could not have had $30,000 of his own money to open \nthe business. More likely, he borrowed all of the funds required for the business. In \naddition, Applicant presented no information to show he had experience and ability to \noperate the business and that it was a viable business opportunity. He had two previous \nbusiness ventures that were not successful. He did not present any marketing survey or \nbusiness plan to establish that the silk screen printing business would succeed. He did \nnot present any information to show he had a sustainable agreement with his friend to \nteach him the aspects of the silk screen printing business as well as the friend's role in \nthe purchase and leasing of equipment. Applicant is given partial credit under this \nmitigating condition for the circumstances beyond his control but not for acting \nresponsibly under the circumstances.  \n \nI considered FC MC AG \u00b6 20(d) \"the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\". For FC MC AG \u00b6 20(d) to \napply, there must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d \nof a good-faith effort to repay. A systematic, concrete method of handling debts is \nneeded. The applicant must establish a \"meaningful track record\" of debt payment. A \n\"meaningful track record\" of debt payment can be established by evidence of actual \ndebt payments or reduction of debt through payment of debts. An applicant is not \nrequired to establish that he paid off each debt listed. The entirety of an applicant\u2019s \nfinancial situation and his actions can reasonably be considered in evaluating the extent \nto which that applicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is \ncredible and realistic. There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments on all \noutstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct \nmay provide for the payment of such debts one at a time. All that is required is that the \napplicant demonstrated he has established a plan to resolve his financial problems and \ntaken significant actions to implement that plan.   \n \n \nApplicant sold a motorcycle and the proceeds paid the remaining debt. His house \nwas foreclosed and the sale resulted in no mortgage deficiency. The allegations \nconcerning these debts are resolved for Applicant. However, Applicant has not paid any \nof the other debts. His only plan to pay the remaining significant debt is to await the \noutcome of his workman's compensation claim and the potential claim against his friend \n\n \n8 \n \n \nfor the silk screen printing business. The outcome of both actions is not clear. A stated \nfuture intention to pay debts is not sufficient to establish a good-faith effort to pay debts. \nApplicant has not presented sufficient information to indicate a good-faith effort to pay \ncreditors or resolve debts. His finances are not under control and he has not acted \nresponsibly. Applicant has not presented sufficient information to mitigate security \nconcerns for financial considerations. \n \nWhole Person Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant's service in \nthe Navy, and his willingness to go to Iraq to support the war effort.   \n \nTo overcome financial considerations security concerns, an applicant must show \na \"meaningful track record\" of debt payment, including evidence of actual debt reduction \nthrough payment of debts. Available, reliable information about the Applicant, past and \npresent, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination. \nApplicant must demonstrate that he has a plan to resolve his financial problems and has \ntaken significant actions to implement that plan. The entirety of Applicant's financial \nsituation and actions must establish that Applicant\u2019s plan for the reduction of his \noutstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic.  \n \nApplicant does not have a meaningful track record of debt reduction or payment. \nThe three debts in the SOR that have been paid were paid through little action by \nApplicant. His house was foreclosed but sufficient funds were recovered to pay the two \nmortgages. Likewise, his motorcycle sold for a sufficient price to pay the debt on the \nvehicle. The resolution of these debts does not establish a meaningful track record of \npaying debts. All other debts attributed to Applicant have not been paid nor addressed \n\n \n9 \n \n \nso there is no meaningful track record. His decision to open a silk screen business by \nborrowing heavily to open the business and his lack of a business plan shows \nirresponsibility towards his finances.  \n \nApplicant was irresponsible in managing his business and finances. His finances \nare not sound in that most of his accounts have not been paid, he has no means of \npaying the debts, and his income is only sufficient to meet his current needs. Applicant \nhas not established he is suitable for a security clearance since he has been \nirresponsible toward his finances indicating he will be irresponsible towards the \nsafeguarding of classified information. He has not established he is reliable, trustworthy \nand exercises good judgment. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the security concerns arising from his financial situation. Overall, on balance \nthe record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns arising from financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.j: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR and he requested a hearing before\nan Administrative Judge. I received the case assignment on March 12, 2009. DOHA\nissued a notice of hearing on March 18, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled\non April 28, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1-5, which were received\nwithout objection. Applicant testified in his own behalf. He submitted Exhibits (AE) A-C\nwhich were admitted into the record without objection. I held the record open until May\nMay 20, 2009\n\n2\n12, 2009 for any additional documents that Applicant wished to submit. Applicant\nsubmitted a packet of documents that was marked as AE D and received into the record\nwithout objection. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on May 6, 2009.\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for\naccess to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated February 23, 2009, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.c of the SOR. He denied allegations \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and\n1.e. because he thought they were related to the judgments. He provided additional\ninformation to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee of a defense contractor. After he graduated\nfrom high school, he attended college from 1995 until 2001. He worked full time and\ncompleted his undergraduate courses and received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 2005.\nHe has worked for his current employer since February 2006 (GE 1). He is single and\nhas no children (Tr. 20). He holds a security clearance (public trust for DoD) (Tr. 22).\nApplicant was approached by a family friend in 2006 to engage in a business\nventure. He learned of three properties that were available for sale in another state (Tr.\n24). Applicant agreed to buy the properties and take out a mortgage for each of the\nproperties. The total was approximately $200,000 (GE 3).\nApplicant was ambitious and wanted to \u201cget ahead\u201d. The market was good and\nhe admits being overzealous about becoming an investor (Tr. 31). He agreed to this\nbusiness deal but admitted that he had not researched the properties and had no\nknowledge in this area (Tr. 11). He did not schedule a trip to view the properties. He\nsaw pictures of them. His friend was to rehabilitate the properties and find renters for\nthem. This did not occur. Sometime in 2007, Applicant tried to end the partnership.\nApplicant learned that payments were not made on the mortgages (Tr. 33). He\ncontacted the banks holding the mortgages (AE A). He was advised by the bank to try a\n\u201cshort sell\u201d the properties. He could not reach his friend by telephone. Applicant did not\nhave the money to pay the mortgages as he had been counting on rental income to pay\nfor the mortgages (Tr. 29). The properties were foreclosed and the banks obtained\ndefault judgments in each case.\nThe SOR alleged five delinquent debts, including three judgments and two past\ndue mortgages. The total amount of delinquent debt is approximately $200,000 (GE 3).\nApplicant admitted that the default judgments were for the three properties. He has not\npaid on any of the judgments. At the hearing, he admitted he had no information to\ndispute the allegations concerning the late mortgages to the other two banks (GE 4, 5).\nHowever, he knows he purchased three properties and signed three mortgages.\nApplicant submitted documentation after the hearing regarding the three properties and\n\n3\nthe judgments. In each case, the judgment was partially satisfied due to a sale of the\nproperty. This reduces the amount that Appellant owes on each of them (AE D). \nApplicant discussed the situation with a bankruptcy attorney last summer but he\ndoes not want to file for bankruptcy. He wants to pay his debts (Tr. 39). In 2007, he\nwrote a letter to one of the mortgage companies and tried to have a realtor sell the\nproperty (AE A). Applicant hired another attorney who is a friend of his to research any\noptions that Applicant may have in this matter because Applicant wants to protect his\nprimary residence. Applicant\u2019s lawyer has no information on the properties as yet.\nApplicant\u2019s current net monthly income is $4,736 (GE 2). After expenses and\npayments to current credit card accounts, he has a negative net remainder. He has a\nbudget and a savings plan. He is current on all his expenses (Tr.). He owns a condo\nand is current on his mortgage. He admits to living pay check to paycheck (Tr. 80).\nApplicant acknowledged that he took several vacations in the past few years with\nbonus money from his employment. He also purchased a car in 2008. He was leasing a\nvehicle prior to that time.\nApplicant emphasized that prior to this business venture, his credit was good.\nEach position that he obtained earned him a greater salary. He was able to finance his\ncondominium in 2005 with no problems. He currently has about $26,000 equity in his\ncondominium.  \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\n\n4\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant has three judgments that are unpaid totaling less than\n$200,000. He admits that could not meet his financial obligations from 2006 until the\npresent. His credit reports confirm that he has the judgments and the past due\nmortgages. The evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions.\n\n5\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant\nengaged in a business venture in 2006. He wanted to use investment to have a second\nincome. The venture failed recently and his judgments are outstanding in an amount\nless than $200,000. This potentially mitigating condition does not apply. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant freely entered\ninto the business venture without researching the properties. He acknowledged that he\nhad no knowledge of the business. I find this mitigating condition does not apply. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has not received formal financial counseling. He has\nnot paid any of the judgments or late mortgages. He presented no evidence of financial\nreform or resolution of debts. I conclude these mitigating conditions do not apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nApplicant is an intelligent, young professional. He has been steadily employed\nsince 2001 and has earned a higher income each year. He is single with no children. He\npurchased his own condominium in 2005. He had good credit. In 2006, he decided to\nengage in a business venture with a family friend. He did no research on any of the\nproperties involved. He trusted his friend but he signed the three mortgages for the\n\n6\nproperties. The mortgages were not paid and default judgments were entered. He\ndecided not to file for bankruptcy but he has no immediate plan in place to pay the\njudgments that total less than $200,000. He is consulting another attorney and promises\nto pay his debts. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude Applicant has not met\nhis burden in this case. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

He submitted an earlier SF 86 on October 17, 1997. On April 9, 2009,\nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued to Applicant a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his application,\nciting security concerns under Guideline B (Foreign Influence). The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on May 3, 2009, and elected to have\nhis case decided on the record in lieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the\nNovember 9, 2009\n\nThe Government submitted eight items in support of its contention.\n1\n2\nGovernment\u2019s written case on July 13, 2009.  Applicant received a complete file of\n1\nrelevant material (FORM) on July 21, 2009, and was provided the opportunity to file\nobjections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s case.\nApplicant submitted a packet (AE A). The case was assigned to me on September 2,\n2009. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to Syria. The request and the attached documents are included in\nthe record as Item 8. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of\nFact, below.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f\nwith a partial denial of 1.b. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. I make\nthe following findings:\nApplicant is a 63-year-old man who was born and educated in Syria. He taught\nEnglish in a secondary school for the Ministry of Education in Syria from 1971 until 1986.\nApplicant was drafted and served in the Syrian military from 1974 until 1977. He has\nlived in the United States since 1986 (Item 6). He became a naturalized U.S. Citizen in\nMay 1991. Applicant attended an American college from 1988 until 1991 (Item 3). He\nhas been employed with his current employer since October 2003 as a translator\n(linguist) (Item 1). Before that time, Applicant served as a translator for other federal\ncontractors. He lived on Air Force installations in the Middle East. He has held a security\nclearance since 2002 (Item 1). He is currently working in the Middle East for the U.S.\nGovernment.\nApplicant married his wife in 1980 in Syria (Item 5). She is a naturalized U.S.\ncitizen and resides with Applicant in the U.S. They have three children. The two\nyoungest, ages 20 and 18, acquired U.S. citizenship by birth in the United States. The\neldest child, age 26, was born in Syria, but she became a naturalized American citizen in\n1993 (Item 1). Applicant\u2019s father and mother are deceased. \nApplicant has a brother and sister who are citizens and residents of Syria (SOR \u00b6\n1.a). His brother, who is single, works as a televison technician. His sister is a retired\nteacher and had no connection with the Syrian government. In 1991, when Applicant\nbecame a U.S. citizen, he filed a petition for immigration to the United States to sponsor\nhis brother and sister. The petitions are in accordance with the U.S. Immigration Act. His\nyoungest brother entered the U.S. in 2006 and has an alien registration. He lived with\nApplicant for an undisclosed short period but does not live with Applicant now.\n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s brother is a permanent resident in the U.S. His brother is retired from the\nSyrian Army (SOR \u00b6 1.b). \nApplicant traveled to Syria in 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005, and 2006 to visit his family\n(SOR \u00b6 1.c). He used his U.S. passport and obtained permission of his squadron\ncommander for the trips (Item 7). He completed the foreign travel questionnaire for the\nvacation in the foreign country. He also completed a pre-travel and post-travel\nquestionnaire. While in Syria, he stayed at the home of his brother and sister. During an\nearlier time, there was no policy against a translator visiting his or her family.  \nApplicant\u2019s immediate family knows that he is a translator for the United States\nbut they do not know the details of his work. His family is supportive of the efforts of the\nUnited States. None of his family members have been the victims of violence. None have\nbeen threatened due to Applicant\u2019s work for the United States. His entire family are\nChristians. \nApplicant emphasized that \u201che loves his siblings but he has no obligation to them.\u201d\nHis immediate family has lived in the United States for many years. His commitment is to\nhis American family. He loves the United States. He has deeper and more substantial\nties to the United States. Applicant is willing to bear arms for the United States and will\nresolve any conflict in favor of the United States interest (AE A).\nApplicant has property in Syria. He purchased an apartment in 2005 for $30,000.\nHe uses the apartment when he visits Syria (SOR \u00b6 1.f; Item 6). Applicant gave his\nbrother a general power of attorney in 1986. His brother manages the apartment, and\nrents it for approximately $100 a month. Applicant does not receive the financial benefit\nfrom the apartment. He does not have any other assets in Syria. He is not eligible for any\neducational or retirement benefits from Syria (Item 6).The majority of Applicant\u2019s assets,\nincluding his home, are in the United States.\nApplicant sends money to his siblings in Syria in the amount of $1,000 to $1,500\nonce every three months (SOR \u00b6 1.e). He maintains monthly contact with them by\ntelephone (Item 6).\nApplicant asserted his pride of U.S. citizenship and love for his work with the Air\nForce. He lives on military installations. He worked in combat zones for almost 11 years.\nHe worked long hours for six days a week. He is one of the longest serving linguists in\nthe area of responsibility (AOR). He has willingly put himself in danger every day in order\nto help the U.S.  \nApplicant emphasized that he would never betray the United States. His 2009\naffidavit, submitted in response to the FORM, emphasizes his allegiance to the United\nStates. He has lived in the U.S. with his wife and children. He owns a home in the United\nStates, which has substantially more value than his apartment in Syria.\n\n4\nThe evidence shows Applicant has not breached security policies or procedures\nwhile holding a security clearance. He has 11 certificates of appreciation for his work in\nthe Middle East and Iraq (AE A). Applicant has complied with rules and existing agency\nrequirements regarding the reporting of contacts or threats from persons, groups, or\norganizations from a foreign country. He affirmed in 2009 sworn statement that he has\nnever been approached by any foreign intelligence or security service, or terrorist\norganization (AE A).\nApplicant presented a recommendation from his commander, Chief, Security\nForces, who serves with the U.S. Air Force. Applicant has worked closely with his team\nsince October 2003. Applicant has provided total commitment to the mission. He is a\ncompetent and experienced professional. His loyalty to the unit has never been\nquestioned. Applicant has been trusted with team-critical responsibilities. He is an honest\nworker. He has always been an asset to his team. \nApplicant received several certificates of appreciation while serving as a translator\nfrom 2001 until the present. He is noted for his outstanding support of a unit in Operation\nIraqi Freedom. He was praised for his expert linguistic skill and professionalism in his\nduties.\nI take administrative notice of the following facts about Syria. Since March 1963,\nthe Syrian Arab Republic has been ruled by an authoritarian regime. Syria is currently\nincluded on the Department of State\u2019s List of State Sponsors of Terrorism due to the\npresence of several terrorist groups in Syria. According to the Department of State, the\nSyrian Government continues to provide political and material support to Hizballah and\nPalestinian terrorist groups. Several terrorist groups base their external leadership within\nSyria\u2019s borders, and maintain offices in Syria. Syria is \u201cone of the primary transit points\nfor foreign fighters entering Iraq.\u201d\nOn February 13, 2008, President Bush expanded a 2004 Executive Order\nimplementing sanctions against Syria for its support of terrorism in the Middle East. In\nMay 2009, President Obama continued the declaration of a national emergency,\n\u201c[b]ecause the actions and policies of the Government of Syria continue to pose an\nunusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of\nthe United States.\u201d\nPolicies\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . .\n. control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an\nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  Id. at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of\nDefense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information\n\u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec.\n\n5\nOr. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as\namended and modified.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the\ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not\ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these\nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An\nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common\nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.\nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with\naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and\nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the\npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard\nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified\ninformation.\nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or.\n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant\nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance.\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the\npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from\nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of\nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v.\nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines\npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the\ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611\nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial\nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the\nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531;\nsee AG \u00b6 2(b). \n\n6\nAnalysis\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence)\nThe SOR alleges Applicant has a sister and brother who are citizens of and\nresidents of Syria (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b). His youngest brother is a retired officer in the\nSyrian armed forces, and lived with Applicant for an undisclosed period in 2006. It also\nalleges Applicant traveled to Syria in 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005, and 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.c).\nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges that SOR \u00b6 1.e alleges Applicant sends money to his siblings in Syria\nto help with their living expenses, and SOR \u00b6 1.f alleges that Applicant owns property in\nSyria. The security concern relating to Guideline B is set out in AG \u00b6 6 as follows: \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nA disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201ccontact with a foreign family member,\nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident\nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(a).  A disqualifying condition\nalso may be raised by \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country\nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect\nsensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person,\ngroup, or country by providing that information.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(b). Applicant\u2019s sister and brother\nare citizens and residents of Syria. Applicant maintains monthly contact with them. He\nworks as a translator for the U. S. Air Force and has visited his siblings in Syria on five\nseparate occasions. He acknowledged that his wife knows about his work. Based on this\nevidence, AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), and (b) are raised.\nSince the government produced evidence to raise the disqualifying conditions in\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of\nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the\ngovernment.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United\nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information\nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it,\n\n7\nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those\nof the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United\nStates over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security.\nFinally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States,\nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields.  See ISCR Case No. 00-0317,\n2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002). Nevertheless, the nature of a\nnation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights record are\nrelevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to\ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater\nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is associated\nwith or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct intelligence\noperations against the U.S.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of\nthe U.S.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(a).  The totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well\nas each individual family tie must be considered.  ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App.\nBd. Sep. 22, 2003). Similarly, AG 8(c) \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is\nso casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation.\u201d Applicant has monthly phone contact with his brother and\nsister. He has visited his siblings in Syria. Thus, this mitigating condition has only partial\napplication in this case.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is\nno conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the\nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such\ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be\nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(b).\nApplicant spoke to his undivided loyalty to the U.S. Based on his relationship and loyalty\nto the U.S., he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S.\ninterest. He has lived in the U.S. since 1986. His wife and three children are citizens of\nthe U.S. He owns property in the U.S. He has worked in the U.S. for many years. He has\nendured dangerous conditions in the Middle East and Iraq on behalf of the U.S. Air\nForce. There is no evidence that he has connections or contact with any people other\nthan his sister and brothers. He has established application of AG \u00b6 8(b). \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\n\n8\nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nThe Appeal Board requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an\napplicant\u2019s personal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family ties to the\nU.S. relative to his or her ties to a foreign country; his or her social ties within the U.S.;\nand ,many others raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 7\n(App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Four circumstances weigh against\nApplicant in the whole person analysis. First, there is a risk of terrorism and various\nhuman rights abuses in Syria. More importantly for security purposes, terrorists are\nhostile to the U.S. and actively seek classified information. Terrorists, and the Syrian\ngovernment, could attempt to use Applicant\u2019s sister and brother to obtain such\ninformation. Second, he had numerous connections to Syria before he immigrated to the\nU.S. Following his birth, he spent his formative years there, along with his family. He was\neducated in Syria and subsequently conscripted into army. Third, his sister, and brother\nremain citizens of Syria. Fourth, he has contact with his siblings and has visited them in\nSyria. One of his brothers is a retired officer in the Syrian armed forces.\nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs in favor of granting Applicant a security\nclearance. He is a mature person who has lived in the U.S. since 1986 , and has been a\nnaturalized citizen for 18 years. His spouse is a naturalized citizen and resides with him,\nas do his three children. He has a strong sense of patriotism toward the U.S., as\nwitnessed by his dedication and work with the U.S. There is no evidence that he has\never taken any action that could cause potential harm to the U.S. His military\nsupervisors, who work with him daily in a war zone, praised his work in the cause of\nfreedom in the Middle East and Iraq.\nApplicant held a security clearance without indication that he breached security\npolicies or procedures during his tenure with the U.S. Air Force. He served the U.S. in a\ndangerous, high-risk situation and his certificates of commendation establish his\n\n2\nI conclude that the whole person analysis weighs heavily toward approval of his security clearance. Assuming\na higher authority reviewing this decision determines the mitigating conditions articulated under AG 8 do not\napply and severs any consideration of them, I conclude the whole person analysis standing alone is sufficient\nto warrant approval of a security clearance in this case.\n9\nsignificant contributions to U.S. national security. While that fact is not normally to be\nconsidered a factor in granting a clearance, the Appeal Board noted in ISCR Case. No.\n05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2006) as follows:\nAs a general rule, Judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s\nprior history of complying with security procedures and\nregulations significant probative value for purposes of\nrefuting, mitigating, or extenuating the security concerns\nraised by applicant\u2019s more immediate disqualifying conduct\nor circumstances. See, e.g. ISCR  Case. No. 01-03357 at 4\n(App. Bd. Dec. 13, 2005); ISCR Case No 02-10113 at 4\n(App. Bd. Mr. 25, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 2-3\n(App. Bd. May 30, 2006). However, the Board has\nrecognized an exception to that general rule in Guideline B\ncases, where the applicant has established by credible,\nindependent evidence that his compliance with security\nprocedures and regulations occurred in the context of\ndangerous, high-risk circumstances in which the applicant\nmade a significant contribution to the nation\u2019s security. See.\ne.g. ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. July 14, 2006).\nThe presence of such circumstances can give credibility to\nan applicant\u2019s assertion that he can be relied upon to\nrecognize, resist, and report a foreign power\u2019s attempts at\ncoercion or exploitation.\nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all facts and\ncircumstances in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the\nsecurity concerns pertaining to foreign influence.  Overall, the record evidence leaves\n2\nme without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns\narising from foreign influence.\nFormal Findings\nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set\nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3:\nParagraph 1, Foreign Influence:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.f:\nFor Applicant\n\n10\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Mendez, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n \n__________ \n \nDecision \n__________ \n \n \nRIVERA, Juan J., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are partially the result of circumstances beyond his \ncontrol. He understands the importance of maintaining financial responsibility and what \nis expected of him to be eligible for a security clearance. Given his circumstances, he \nhas made reasonable efforts to resolve his financial problems, and given the \nopportunity, he will establish full financial responsibility. On balance, Applicant\u2019s current \nfinancial problems do not cast doubts on his reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on October 10, 2007. After \nreviewing the results of the ensuing background investigation, adjudicators for the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary \nJanuary 13, 2011\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \naffirmative finding1 that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  \n \nOn July 19, 2010, DOHA issued Applicant an SOR, which specified the basis for \nits decision \u2013 security concerns addressed in the Directive under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations) of the adjudicative guidelines (AG).2  \n \nOn July 30, 2010, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on August 25, \n2010, to determine whether a clearance should be granted or denied. DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing on August 27, 2010. A second notice of hearing was issued on \nSeptember 15, 2010, rescheduling the hearing for September 27, 2010. The hearing \nwas convened as scheduled on September 27, 2010. The Government offered Exhibits \n(GE) 1 through 7, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified, and he \npresented Exhibits (AE) 1 through 16, which were admitted without objection. I kept the \nrecord open, allowing Applicant additional time to submit documentary evidence. He \nsubmitted AE 15 and 16, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on October 4, 2010.  \n \nProcedural Issue \n \n \nThe Government moved to amend the SOR by adding Paragraph 1.o, alleging a \n$130,888 second mortgage in collection. The motion was marked and made part of the \nrecord as Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1. Applicant did not object, and I granted the motion as \nrequested. (Tr. 18-20).  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all 15 factual allegations in the SOR, with explanations. His \nadmissions are incorporated here as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the \nevidence of record, and having considered Applicant\u2019s demeanor and testimony, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old information technology systems administrator working \nfor a government contractor. He seeks to retain his security clearance eligibility to \ncontinue his job. Shortly after high school, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy where he served \nfive years on active duty (1991-1995), and six years in the Reserve (1997-2002). During \nhis last 10 months in the Reserve, he was recalled back to active duty. His rate was \n \n1 Required by Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended; and Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as revised. \n \n2 Adjudication of this case is controlled by the AGs, implemented by the DoD on September 1, \n2006. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nintelligence specialist, and he achieved the rank of E-5. His service was characterized \nas honorable.  \n \nWhile in the service, Applicant had access to classified information at the secret \nand top secret levels. After his discharge, his access to classified information was \ncontinued until the present, because of his work for government contractors. There is no \nevidence that he has compromised or caused others to compromise classified \ninformation, or that he has been involved in any security violations.  \n \nApplicant completed an associate\u2019s degree in Computer Information Systems \nfrom 1993 until 1994. He has never been married, but has a four-year-old daughter. He \nprovides $1,100 a month in court-ordered financial support to his daughter. He is \ncurrent in his child support obligation. \n \nApplicant\u2019s employment history shows that he has been consistently employed \nby different government contractors since his discharge from the service. From \nNovember 2005 until December 2007, Applicant worked full-time simultaneously for two \ndifferent government contractors. He was employed for company \u201cS,\u201d and earned \naround $83,000 a year, working from 03:00 p.m. until 11:00 p.m. He worked for \ncompany \u201cH,\u201d from 06:00 a.m. until 02:00 p.m., and earned around $95,000 a year.  \n \nIn early to mid-2007, Applicant entered into a contract to purchase a new home \nfor approximately $526,000. He put down $60,000 when he ordered the construction of \nthe new home. In July 2007, Applicant was laid off from his job with company H. At the \ntime, he had not closed on the purchase of the home. He tried to get out of the real \nestate purchase contract, but he was not allowed to do so without forfeiting his $60,000 \ndown payment. Applicant made the mistake of going through with the purchase of the \nhome with the expectation that he would quickly find another full-time job which would \nallow him to afford the mortgage payments. He closed on the home in October 2007. He \ntook a first mortgage with a monthly payment of approximately $3,900 (SOR 1.h), and a \nsecond mortgage with a monthly payment of about $1,100 (SOR 1.o). Additionally, he \ntook a $29,000 consumer loan to make the mortgage payments until he could find a \nsecond full-time job.  \n \nApplicant was not able to find a second job and he could not afford to pay the \nmortgage, his debts, and his day-to-day living expenses. Most of the debts alleged in \nthe SOR became delinquent during this period when he was neglecting other debts \nwhile trying to make his mortgage payments to save his home. His home was \nforeclosed in January 2008, and later sold.  \n \nIn his October 2007 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed he had \nfinancial problems. His background investigation revealed, and Applicant admitted, the \n15 delinquent or charged-off debts alleged in the SOR. Applicant explained that his \nfinancial problems were the result of him losing one of his full-time jobs and his bad \nbusiness decision to purchase a home beyond his financial means.  \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a $1,477 charged off consumer credit card that became \ndelinquent in 2007, when he lost his second full-time job. In August 2010, he contacted \nthe creditor, settled the debt, and established a payment plan. He made a $200 \npayment in August 2010 (AE 4), and a $447 payment in September 2010 (AE 15). He \nhas another $447 payment due in October 2010. With that payment, the debt will be \npaid in full. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges an $8,508 charged off credit card account that became \ndelinquent in 2007, when he lost his second full-time job. In September 2010, he \ncontacted the creditor and established a payment plan. He made a $112 payment in \nearly September 2010 (AE 5), and a $312 payment in late September 2010. (AE 15)  \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges the same debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. Appellant disputed the \ndebt through the credit bureau and it was removed from his credit report. (AE 6, 10, 11) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges a $2,398 charged off credit card account that became \ndelinquent in 2007. In August 2010, he contacted the creditor, settled the debt, and \nestablished a payment plan. He made a $198 payment in August 2010 (AE 7), a $400 \npayment in September 2010 (AE 15), and a $700 payment in October 2010 (AE 15). \nWith two additional payments the debt will be paid in full. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges a $1,076 charged off consumer credit card that became \ndelinquent in 2007. In August 2010, he contacted the creditor, settled the debt, and \nestablished a payment plan. He made a $176 payment in August 2010 (AE 8), and a \n$300 payment in September 2010 (AE 15). With two additional payments the debt will \nbe paid in full. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges a $1,410 charged off debt to a telephone services provider that \nbecame delinquent in 2007. In September 2010, he contacted the creditor and paid the \ndebt in full. (AE 15) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.g alleges a $406 charged off debt to a telephone services provider that \nbecame delinquent in 2007. In September 2010, he contacted the creditor and paid the \ndebt in full. (AE 9) \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.h alleges a first real estate mortgage past due in the amount of \napproximately $32,500, with a monthly payment of approximately $3,900. SOR \u00b6 1.o \nalleges a second mortgage on the same real estate property that was foreclosed. At his \nhearing, he claimed he no longer has any financial responsibility for either the first or \nsecond mortgages because the law of his state does not allow a creditor to recover for a \nmortgage deficiency after a foreclosure. He presented no documentary evidence to \nsupport his claim. \n \nConcerning SOR \u00b6 1.i ($477), alleging a debt to a cable provider, Applicant \ninitially admitted in his answer to the SOR that it was his delinquent debt. However, he \n\n \n5 \n \n \nlater realized he paid the debt. He presented no documentary evidence to prove it was \npaid. He intends to send a written dispute to the three credit bureaus.  \n \nRegarding SOR \u00b6 1.j, Applicant claimed he is not familiar with the alleged \ncreditor. He believes this is a duplicate allegation of the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \nand 1.c. The debt appears to have been deleted from the most recent credit reports. \nApplicant intends to send a written dispute to the three credit bureaus. \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.k, 1.l, and 1.m allege Applicant\u2019s unpaid traffic tickets that are in \ncollection by a state. He testified he contacted the state and is in the process of \nestablishing a payment plan. He presented no documentary evidence to support his \nclaim. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.n alleges a $130 delinquent medical account. Applicant paid the \naccount in August 2010. (AE 14) \n \nApplicant was sincerely remorseful and contrite about his past financial \nproblems. He is earning around $98,000 a year from his current job. He is still looking \nfor a second full-time job. With income from two jobs, he will be able to address his \nremaining delinquent debts expeditiously. He has been making changes in his lifestyle \nto save money to pay for his debts. He turned in his leased car and currently drives a \n2004 truck that is paid off. He is living with his girlfriend and his daughter, and they \nshare the apartment monthly expenses. Because his real estate property was \nforeclosed and sold, he believes he is no longer legally responsible for the mortgages \nand he will now have some additional money at the end of the month to pay his debts. \nHe sought out financial counseling, and also considered consolidating his debts in a \npayment plan, but decided to pay the debts on his own and avoid the expenses \nassociated with a commercial payment plan. \n \nApplicant acknowledged he made a mistake by closing on the home after he lost \nhis second full-time job. He knew that the income from one job would not be sufficient to \ncover his first and second mortgage payments and pay his remaining debts. He \nbelieved he would be able to find a second job in a short period of time, but he was not \nable to do so. He also acknowledged that he should have been more diligent in \ncontacting his creditors and establishing payment plans. He stated that he was trying to \nrefinance the house and include some of his delinquent debts in the refinancing, but that \ndid not work out. Additionally, he did not have sufficient disposable income at the end of \nthe month to pay for any additional debts and it would not have been reasonable for him \nto attempt to establish payment plans he could not fulfill. Considering the totality of his \ncircumstances, Applicant is doing all he can do to resolve his debts.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nThe President of the United States has the authority to control access to \ninformation bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is \nsufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. Department of the Navy v. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 527 (1988). The President has authorized the Secretary of \nDefense to grant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The U.S. \nSupreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in \nregulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno \none has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These AGs are not inflexible rules of \nlaw. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and \npresent, favorable and unfavorable to reach his decision.  \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any expressed or implied determination about Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication that the Applicant has not met \nthe strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance. \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996); and ISCR Case 08-06605 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 4, 2010).     \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [his or her] security \n\n \n7 \n \n \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the security concern is that failure or inability to live within \none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having \nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \nThe SOR alleged 15 delinquent debts in collection or charged off, which have \nbeen delinquent for several years. Applicant admitted, and the record evidence confirms \nthat SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d-1.h, and 1.k-1.o are his delinquent accounts. His documentary \nevidence shows Applicant settled and is paying the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, \n1.d, and 1.e. He paid off the accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.g, and 1.n. \n \nApplicant disputed the validity of the account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c and it was \nremoved form his credit report. He intends to dispute the account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i, \nbecause he believes he paid it. He also is in the process of disputing SOR \u00b6 1.j, \nbecause he believes it is a duplicate allegation of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c.  \n \nConcerning SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.o, he claimed he no longer has any financial \nresponsibility for either debt because the law of his state does not allow a creditor to \nrecover for a mortgage deficiency after a foreclosure and sale of real estate property. \nHe presented no documentary evidence to support his claim. \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts raise the applicability of AG \u00b6 19(a): \u201cinability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c): \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations.\u201d \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n\n \n8 \n \n \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \nApplicant has been consistently employed by different government contractors \nsince his discharge from the service in 2002. From November 2005 until around July \n2007, Applicant worked two full-time jobs. In July 2007, he was laid off from one of his \nemployers due to a company downsizing. His reduction in income and buying a home \nbeyond his financial means caused most of his debts to become delinquent. \n \nApplicant disclosed his financial problems in his security clearance application. \nOut of the 15 delinquent debts alleged in the SOR, Applicant paid three debts; he \nsettled and made at least two payments in four debts; he successfully disputed one \nSOR debt; and he is in the process of disputing two other debts. In sum, Applicant \nresolved eight of the 15 debts alleged in the SOR, he is in the process of disputing two \ndebts, and he contacted the creditor for three additional debts (traffic tickets) to \nestablish a payment plan. The remaining concern are SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.o, for which he \nclaimed he no longer has any financial responsibility because the law of his state \nprevents a creditor to recover for a mortgage deficiency after a foreclosure and sale of \nthe real estate property.  \n \nOutside of the delinquent debts discussed above, there is no evidence Applicant \nhad other delinquent debts, or that he was living beyond his financial means. Applicant \nhas a substantial income from his current employment. He is seeking another full-time \njob to accelerate the payment of his delinquent obligations. Because he was able to \nhandle two full-time jobs in the past, it is likely he will be able to do so in the future. \nAdditionally, with the payment of some of his debts, he will have more disposable \nincome available to continue to address the remaining financial obligations. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6 20(a) because \nsome of the SOR debts are unresolved (recent behavior). It partially applies because he \nresolved eight of the delinquent debts, he appears to have a valid reason to dispute two \ndebts, and is making arrangements to pay the three traffic tickets. The evidence \n\n \n9 \n \n \n                                           \nestablished circumstances beyond his control contributing to his inability to pay his \ndebts, i.e., he was laid off from one of his full-time jobs and his inability to find another \nfull-time position. AG \u00b6 20(b) is partially established by the evidence. It only applies \npartially, because Applicant did not exercise financial responsibility when he purchased \na home beyond his financial means. Applicant presented sufficient evidence showing \nhis efforts to contact creditors and pay his debts.  \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) applies. Applicant participated in financial counseling. He \ndemonstrated he has the desire to resolve his debts by paying three debts, establishing \npayment plans for four other debts, and disputing one debt. His actions establish partial \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d). He receives only partial credit because he should have \nbeen more diligent and aggressive in the resolution of his debts. AG \u00b6 20(e) partially \napplies because he successfully disputed one debt and is in the process of disputing \ntwo other SOR debts.  \n \n \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, Applicant has a viable plan to resolve his \nfinancial problem. His evidence shows that through the years, he maintained financial \nresponsibility until he lost his second full-time job. He also recently paid three debts and \nmade payment arrangements for four other debts. He has a viable plan to resolve his \nother SOR debts.3  \n \n \nApplicant understands the possible adverse security clearance consequences of \nnot maintaining financial responsibility. I believe that given time, Applicant will resolve \nthe remaining SOR debts and avoid similar financial problems in the future. Although \nApplicant should have been more diligent addressing his debts, and he still has several \nunresolved SOR debts, his past behavior and current financial situation do not raise \ndoubts about his current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. Financial \nconsiderations concerns are mitigated.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n \n3 \u201c[A]n applicant is not required to be debt-free nor to develop a plan for paying off all debts \nimmediately or simultaneously. All that is required is that an applicant act responsibly given his \ncircumstances and develop a reasonable plan for repayment, accompanied by \u201cconcomitant conduct,\u201d \nthat is, actions which evidence a serious intent to effectuate the plan. ISCR Case No. 08-06567 at 3 (App. \nBd. Oct. 29, 2009), citing ISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). \n\n \n10 \n \n \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(c) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment.  \nApplicant served approximately 11 years in the defense of his country. He has \nbeen successful in his jobs for different government contractors since 2002. He is a \nmature man and a good worker. He has sought counseling to overcome his financial \nproblems and understands the importance of maintaining financial responsibility. He has \nheld a security clearance during most of his military service and while working for \ngovernment contractors. There is no evidence he has ever compromised or caused \nothers to compromise classified information. His financial problems seem to be the \nresult of his making the mistake of continuing with the closing of his home knowing he \njust had lost one of his full-time jobs, and his inability to find a new full-time job.  \n \nApplicant is doing all he can do under his circumstances to resolve his financial \nproblems. He has been working hard at his current job. He recently started to make a \ncredible effort to pay his delinquent debts, and has made life-style changes to resolve \nhis financial problems.  \n \nI find Applicant\u2019s testimony credible. He understands the importance of \nmaintaining financial responsibility and what is expected of him to be eligible for a \nsecurity clearance. He disclosed his financial problems in his security clearance \napplication. His delinquent debts were partially the result of circumstances beyond his \ncontrol. Considering his circumstances, he has made reasonable efforts to resolve his \nfinancial problems. He started to resolve his financial problems and given the \nopportunity, I believe he will continue to resolve his financial problems and establish full \nfinancial responsibility. Under the whole-person concept, Applicant\u2019s current financial \nproblems do not cast doubts on his reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment.  \n \nThe record evidence establishes Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.o:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

DeLaney, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant has not mitigated Alcohol Consumption security concerns. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn April 14, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guideline \nG, Alcohol Consumption. The action was taken under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG). \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in an undated response that was received by \nDOHA on May 3, 2010, and elected to have the case decided on the written record in \nlieu of a hearing. Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on \nJune 11, 2010. A complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to \nSeptember 13, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \nApplicant, who was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to \nrefute, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. Applicant received a copy of the \nFORM on June 17, 2010. As of August 6, 2010, he had not responded. The case was \nassigned to me on August 16, 2010.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 27-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has a bachelor\u2019s \ndegree. His Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86), submitted in October \n2007, listed that he had never been married and had no children.1  \n \n \nApplicant started drinking alcohol when he was about 17 or 18. From that time \nuntil May 2007, he reported that he would drink about once or twice a week. He would \ndrink as much beer as he could afford or was offered to him, between 3 to 14 beers.2   \n \n \nApplicant worked in a convenience store in 2002. He was cited in 2002 with sale \nof alcohol to a minor. He was working his last day at the convenience store. He did not \ncheck an individual\u2019s identification and sold the person beer. He pled guilty and paid a \nfine. The convenience store also terminated his employment.3 \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in about February 2004 and charged with underage \nconsumption of alcohol. He obtained a deferred prosecution in which he completed \ncommunity service and attended an alcohol awareness class.4 \n \n \nApplicant was drinking beer and smoking marijuana on an evening in July 2004. \nHe then drove a car. A police officer saw him driving erratically and swerving from side \nto side. Applicant was stopped in the early morning hours for driving out of his marked \nlane. There were empty beer bottles in the car. The officer noted a strong alcohol odor, \nand Applicant flunked a field sobriety test. He refused breath and urine tests. A bag of \nmarijuana and a pipe was found in his pocket. Applicant repeatedly used profanity and \ncalled the officer names. Applicant was arrested and charged with operating a vehicle \nunder the influence of alcohol or drugs (OVI), first offense; improper use of marked \nlanes; no seatbelt; driver consuming alcohol underage; possession of drug \nparaphernalia; and possession of marijuana.  He pled guilty to OVI, and the other \ncharges were dismissed. He was sentenced to 120 days in jail with 117 days \nsuspended, three days to be spent in a residential alcohol treatment program in lieu of \njail, $350 fines and costs, and probation for two years. Terms of his probation included \ncompletion of an alcohol and drug evaluation, total abstinence from alcohol and non-\nprescription drugs for one year, and Applicant was ordered to write a letter of apology to \nthe arresting officer. Applicant has admitted that he \u201cblacked out\u201d and does not \n                                                          \n1 Items 5, 6.  \n \n2 Items 4, 6.  \n \n3 Items 4-7, 9.  \n \n4 Items 4-7.  \n\n \n3 \n \nremember what took place from the time he was home drinking beer until he was \nstopped by the police. He completed the three-day alcohol treatment program. He was \nadvised to seek further treatment, but he declined.5 \n \n \nApplicant stated that he smoked marijuana on three occasions, including the day \nof his OVI arrest. He has not smoked marijuana since that 2004 arrest.6 \n \n \nApplicant was stopped again in January 2007 after a police officer saw his car \nswerving. He smelled of alcohol and flunked the field sobriety test. He consented to a \nbreath test and his blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was reported at .172%. He was \narrested and charged with OVI, second offense; OVI with BAC of .172%; and improper \nuse of marked lanes. He pled guilty in June 2007 to OVI, second offense, and the other \ncharges were dismissed. He was sentenced to 180 days in jail with 170 days \nsuspended and 10 days to be spent in jail, $400 fines and costs, driver\u2019s license \nsuspended for one year, and probation for two years. Terms of his probation included \ncompletion of an alcohol and drug assessment, and total abstinence from alcohol and \nillegal substances.7 \n \n \nApplicant completed an alcohol program in February 2007. The program was \ndescribed as \u201ca two session intervention aimed at high risk alcohol consumption.\u201d This \nprogram satisfied the court-ordered requirement for an alcohol and drug assessment. \nApplicant also attended bi-weekly sessions with a counsellor until May 2007.8  \n \n \nApplicant listed his criminal record and marijuana use when he submitted his SF \n86 in October 2007. He was interviewed by an investigator from the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) in April 2008. He fully discussed his criminal record, his marijuana \nuse, and his alcohol consumption. He stated he was remorseful about his actions. He \nstated that he would never again drive after drinking. He stated at that time, he drank \nabout once or twice a month, with a maximum of six beers at any sitting.9  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s interview with the OPM investigator was summarized in a report of \ninvestigation (ROI). Except for several small modifications, Applicant verified the \naccuracy of the ROI when he responded to DOHA interrogatories in December 15, \n2008. He did not provide any additional information about his alcohol consumption. \nThere is nothing in the record about Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption after 2008.10 \n \n \n                                                          \n5 Items 4-6, 8.  \n \n6 Items 5, 6.  \n \n7 Items 4-7.  \n \n8 Items 4, 6.  \n \n9 Items 5, 6.  \n \n10 Item 6.  \n\n \n4 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \n \nThe security concern for Alcohol Consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21:   \n     \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is \ndiagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent; and \n \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent.  \n \nApplicant has several alcohol-related arrests and convictions. He admitted to \nexcessive drinking including a blackout. AG \u00b6\u00b6 22(a) and (c) are applicable.  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges Applicant\u2019s charge of sale of alcohol to a minor in 2002. While \nalcohol was involved in the charge, it did not involve Applicant consuming alcohol.  SOR \n\u00b6 1.b is concluded for Applicant. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges that Applicant attended alcohol counseling in February 2007 \ndue to his alcohol-related arrest that was alleged in another allegation. Alcohol \ncounseling is a matter of mitigation. It does not raise a disqualifying condition. SOR \u00b6 1.f \nis concluded for Applicant.  \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.g both allege that Applicant consumed alcohol until at least \nApril 2008, except SOR \u00b6 1.g added that Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption was \n\u201cnotwithstanding [his] alcohol-related offenses and/or alcohol counseling, as set forth [in \nother allegations].\u201d These two allegations state the same underlying conduct. SOR \u00b6 1.g \nsimply adds facts and circumstances surrounding the information that is already alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.a. When two allegations under the same guideline allege the same conduct, \nat least one must be concluded for the applicant. SOR \u00b6 1.g is concluded for Applicant. \n \nThree Alcohol Consumption Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 23 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \n\n \n6 \n \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment;  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol \nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or \nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser); and \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s last alcohol-related arrest was in 2007. He has completed several \ncourt-ordered alcohol programs. He continues to drink alcohol, but indicated that he no \nlonger drinks and drives and he only drinks in moderation. There is no favorable \nprognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a licensed clinical social worker. \nThere is nothing in the record about Applicant\u2019s current alcohol consumption. Based \nupon Applicant\u2019s history of alcohol-related incidents and absence of current information \nabout his alcohol consumption, there is insufficient evidence for a finding that Applicant \nhas his alcohol use under control. His alcohol use, resulting in multiple arrests, \ncontinues to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nNone of the mitigating conditions are completely applicable.  \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.        \n\n \n7 \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline G in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is 27 \nyears old. He has multiple alcohol-related arrests and convictions. He stated in 2008 \nthat he continued to drink in moderation and he no longer drove after drinking. There is \nno information in the record about his alcohol consumption after 2008. Applicant \ndeserves some credit for being truthful on his SF 86 and in his background interview. \nHe appears to be remorseful, but at this time, concerns remain about his judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated Alcohol Consumption security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline G:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.e: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.g: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, and 1.h. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 54-year-old system administrator for a defense contractor. He has worked for his current employer since April 2003. He served on active duty in the U.S. Army from January 1974 to January 1978 (AX A). Except for a period of unemployment from January 1997 to April 1998, he has worked for federal contractors since 1979 (Tr. 34). He received a clearance from another federal agency in September 1982. He currently holds a secret clearance (Tr. 7). Applicant was married in November 1992 and divorced in December 1998. He and his ex-wife had a son, who is now 17 years old. Applicant was paying child support, but he was given full custody of his son after his ex-wife passed away in July 2007. His son is a senior in high school with a good academic record, and he is preparing to attend college (AX B; Tr. 30-31).

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on January 11, 2008. On \nApril 27, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent Applicant a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guideline F. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on \nDecember 29, 2005.  \n \n \nApplicant received the SOR on May 14, 2009; answered it on June 20, 2009; and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received the request on \nSeptember 29, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nJune 22, 2009. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on July 17, 2009, and the \ncase was assigned to me on July 22, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on July \n24, 2009, scheduling the hearing for August 25, 2009. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 6 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Department Counsel also presented a demonstrative exhibit summarizing the \nevidence, which is attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HX) I. Applicant testified \nand submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A and B, which were admitted without objection. \n \nI kept the record open until September 11, 2009, to enable Applicant to submit \nadditional documentary evidence. He telephonically requested an extension until \nSeptember 18, 2009, which I granted. He timely submitted AX C, which was admitted \nwithout objection. Department Counsel\u2019s response to AX C is attached to the record as \nHX II. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on September 1, 2009. The record closed on \nSeptember 18, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, \n1.g, and 1.h. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my \nfindings of fact.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 54-year-old system administrator for a defense contractor. He has \nworked for his current employer since April 2003. He served on active duty in the U.S. \nArmy from January 1974 to January 1978 (AX A). Except for a period of unemployment \nfrom January 1997 to April 1998, he has worked for federal contractors since 1979 (Tr. \n34). He received a clearance from another federal agency in September 1982. He \ncurrently holds a secret clearance (Tr. 7). \n \n \nApplicant was married in November 1992 and divorced in December 1998. He \nand his ex-wife had a son, who is now 17 years old. Applicant was paying child support, \nbut he was given full custody of his son after his ex-wife passed away in July 2007. His \nson is a senior in high school with a good academic record, and he is preparing to \nattend college (AX B; Tr. 30-31). His son inherited a substantial sum of money from his \nmother and does not depend on Applicant for financial support (Tr. 61-62, 67-68). \n \n \nThe SOR alleges nine delinquent debts totalling more than $49,000. The debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.i are duplicates. All the debts became delinquent around \n2002-2003, except the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.h, which became delinquent in 2007. \n \n \nApplicant testified the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c were paid, but he \nsubmitted no documentation of payment (Tr. 68-69). He promised to submit \ndocumentation after the hearing (Tr. 69), but he submitted nothing regarding these \ndebts in his post-hearing submission.  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant testified he received a settlement offer from the creditor alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.e, but he had not accepted the offer (Tr. 70). He presented no additional evidence \nregarding this debt in his post-hearing submission.  \n \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g is an unsatisfied judgment for unpaid \ncondominium fees. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant submitted a promissory note \nthat he executed, promising to pay the debt in installments. He testified he is paying \n$575 on the note and will pay it off when he is able (Tr. 57). He provided no \ndocumentation of any payments. \n \n \nThe credit card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h arose when Applicant gave his ex-wife \na credit card to be used for their son. He refused to pay the balance because his ex-wife \nused the card for other purchases. After his ex-wife passed away, a collection agency \nobtained a judgment against Applicant for the full amount of the balance due (GX 5 at 3-\n4). Applicant has satisfied the judgment (Answer at 3-4).  \n \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i is the deficiency after an automobile was \nrepossessed. Although Applicant denied this debt in his answer to the SOR, he \nadmitted at the hearing that the car was repossessed. He disagreed with the amount \nclaimed due. He has not contacted the creditor or otherwise attempted to resolve the \ndispute (Tr. 52-54). \n \nThe table below summarizes the evidence concerning the delinquent debts \nalleged in the SOR. \n \nSOR Debt \nAmount \nAnswer\nStatus \nEvidence \n1.a \nCar loan, same \ndebt as \u00b6 1.i \n$13,396 \nDeny \nUnpaid \nGX 3 at 2 \n1.b \nCredit card \n$912 \nDeny \nUnpaid \nGX 4 at 10; GX 5 at 10; \nGX 6 at 4 \n1.c \nLine of credit \n$3,958 \nDeny \nUnpaid \nGX 4 at 10; GX 6 at 4; \nGX 5 at 10 \n1.d \nOverdraft \n$310 \nAdmit \nUnpaid \nGX 2 at 2; GX 5 at 8 \n1.e \nCredit card \n$567 \nAdmit \nUnpaid \nGX 2 at 2; GX 3 at 2;  \nGX 5 at 7, 9 \n1.f \nCredit card \n$156 \nDeny \nUnpaid \nGX 4 at 10 \n1.g \nCondo fees \n$5,857 \nAdmit  \nUnpaid \nGX 2 at 2; Answer at 2; \nTr. 57 \n1.h \nCollection \n$6,558 \nAdmit  \nPaid \nGX 5 at 3-4; Answer at 3 \n1.i \nCar repossession $17,596 \nDeny \nUnpaid \nGX 4 at 8; GX 5 at 8, 10 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s monthly take-home pay is about $5,300. He is buying his \ncondominium, and his monthly mortgage payments are about $1,300 (Tr. 55). He owns \na six-year-old car and has no car-related debt (Tr. 58). He has about $300,000 in a \ngovernment retirement account and about $5,000 in a 401(k) retirement account (Tr. \n63-64). He suffers from diabetes and has out-of-pocket expenses of about $100 per \n\n \n4 \n \n \nmonth for medication (Tr. 60). He has not sought or received financial counseling (Tr. \n65). He denied five of the debts alleged in the SOR, but he has not disputed them or \nprovided any documentation supporting a basis for disputing them (Tr. 71).  \n \n \nApplicant promised to submit documentation showing resolution of the debts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.e, 1.g, and 1.h after the hearing (Tr. 74-76). His post-hearing \nsubmission consisted only of a one-page handwritten statement that he intended to pay \nthe unsatisfied judgments against him within one year (AX C). \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \n\n \n5 \n \n \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nTwo disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant. AG \u00b6 19(a) is \nraised where there is an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.\u201d AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised \nwhen there is \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial history raises AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c), shifting the burden to him \nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has \nthe burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts \nto the government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \n\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(a). This is a compound \nmitigating condition, with three disjunctive prongs and one conjunctive prong. It may be \nestablished by showing the conduct was \u201cso long ago,\u201d or \u201cso infrequent,\u201d or \u201coccurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.\u201d If any of the three disjunctive \nprongs are established, the mitigating condition is not fully established unless the \n\n \n6 \n \n \nconduct \u201cdoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.\u201d This mitigating condition is not established because Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent debts are numerous, many are not yet resolved, and they did not occur \nunder circumstances making them unlikely to recur. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e., conditions beyond the \npersons=s control and responsible conduct, must be established. \n \nApplicant was divorced well before his current financial problems arose, and \nthere is no evidence his marital breakup caused his financial problems. His periods of \nunemployment were beyond his control, but he has not responded reasonably after \nreturning to the workforce. He has been employed by his current employer since April \n2003, and he paid the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h, but he has not made reasonable \nefforts to resolve his other delinquent debts or document his remedial actions. I \nconclude AG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(c). This \nmitigating condition is not established because Applicant has not sought or received \nfinancial counseling. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.\u201d AG \u00b6 20(d). The concept of good faith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in \na way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or \nobligation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999).   \n \nApplicant is not required to establish that he has paid off each and every debt \nlisted in the SOR. He must show, however, that he has a reasonable and feasible plan \nto resolve his financial problems and that he has taken significant actions to implement \nthat plan. ADP Case No. 06-18900 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2008).  \n \nApplicant testified he was making payments on the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g, \nbut he produced no documentary evidence of any payments. He produced evidence \nthat the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h was paid. With respect to the remaining delinquent debts, he \nhas no plan and has taken virtually no action to resolve them. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(d) is \nnot established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigating by showing Athe \nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is \nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of \n\n \n7 \n \n \nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.@ AG \u00b6 20(e). Although \nApplicant denied five debts and testified he disagreed with the amount of the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i, this mitigating condition is not established because he produced \nno documentation for the basis of his disputes and he has taken no action to resolve \nthem. \n \n \nThe same underlying debt is alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.i. When the same \nconduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative \nallegations should be resolved in Applicant=s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 (App. \nBd. Sep. 21, 2005) at 3 (same debt alleged twice). Accordingly, I resolve SOR \u00b6 1.a for \nApplicant.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature adult with many years of service to the government. He has \nheld a clearance for many years, apparently without incident. He was sincere and \ncandid at the hearing, but he did not appear to have a good grasp of his financial \nsituation. He promised extensive documentation of his financial situation, but he \nproduced virtually nothing, even though he was given additional time to do so.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nnot mitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has not carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to continue his eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.b-1.g: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

On March 2, 2009, the Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her (GE 7), \npursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within \nIndustry, dated February 20, 1960, as amended and modified; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified and revised; Department of \nDefense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated Jan. 1987, as \namended (Regulation); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \nOctober 13, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nThe SOR alleges trustworthiness concerns under Guideline B (Foreign \nInfluence). The SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary \naffirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility to occupy a public trust position, which \npermits access to sensitive information, and recommended referral to an administrative \njudge to determine whether such access to sensitive information should be granted, \ncontinued, denied, or revoked. \n \nOn March 20, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and elected to \nhave her case decided by a hearing before an administrative judge (GE 8). On May 21, \n2008, Department Counsel indicated she was ready to proceed. On May 26, 2009, the \ncase was assigned to another administrative judge. On June 1 and 25, 2009, DOHA \nissued hearing notices (GE 5, 6). On June 30, 2009, the case was transferred to me. On \nJuly 8, 2009, DOHA issued a hearing notice (GE 4). On August 12, 2009, the hearing \nwas held as scheduled (Transcript (Tr.) 4; GE 4). At the hearing, Department Counsel \noffered three exhibits (GE 1-3) (Tr. 15-16), and Applicant offered 10 exhibits (Tr. 18-21; \nAE A-J). There were no objections, and I admitted GE 1-3 (Tr. 16), and AE A-J (Tr. 21). \nAdditionally, I admitted the SOR, response to the SOR, and three hearing notices (GE \n4-8). I received the transcript on August 20, 2009. On September 4, 2009, Department \nCounsel provided her closing argument and copies of AE K and L. I admitted AE K and \nL into evidence. \n \nProcedural Ruling \n \nDepartment Counsel requested administrative notice of facts concerning the \nRepublic of India (hereinafter India) (Tr. 16). Department Counsel provided supporting \ndocuments to show detail and context for these facts in the Administrative Notice \nrequest. See the India section of the Findings of Fact of this decision, infra, for the \nmaterial facts receiving administrative notice concerning India.  \n \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004) and McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization  \nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). Usually administrative notice in ISCR \nproceedings is accorded to facts that are either well known or from government reports. \nSee Stein, Administrative Law, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. 2006) (listing fifteen types \nof facts for administrative notice).  \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nApplicant admitted the SOR allegations in her SOR response with some \nexplanations (GE 8). Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \n \n1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \ncomplete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of \nfact.   \n \n \nApplicant is a 35-year-old employee of a defense contractor (Tr. 5, 22). She was \nborn in India and lived there until she was 25. She is a senior software engineer (Tr. \n22). A defense contractor has employed her for about 16 months (Tr. 23). She does not \ncurrently occupy a public trust position (Tr. 6). She has been married for 12 years and \nhas two children, ages eight and three years old (Tr. 22). Her husband is a naturalized \nU.S. citizen and her children were born in the United States (Tr. 39-40; AE F, G). \n \nIn 1997, she received her education through the master\u2019s degree level in India \n(Tr. 5). In 1999, she and her husband immigrated to the United States (Tr. 23, 37).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother and father are citizens and residents of India (SOR \u00b6 1.a of \nGE 7; GE 8). Her father is a 70-year-old retired engineer, who worked for a company \nthat was a semi-government entity (Tr. 24; SOR \u00b6 1.b of GE 7; GE 8). He has been \nretired for about 12 years (Tr. 24). Her mother is a 55-year-old professor at a private \nuniversity in India (Tr. 23). She contacts her parents about once a month (Tr. 26). Her \nmother has visited the United States three times, most recently in 2007, when \nApplicant\u2019s youngest child was born (Tr. 42). She does not discuss her government-\nrelated work with her parents or her brother (Tr. 36). \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother is a 27-year-old lieutenant in the Indian armed forces (Tr. 25-\n26; SOR \u00b6 1.c of GE 7; GE 8).  He has served in the armed forces for two years (Tr. \n26). He does not have access to Indian classified information (Tr. 29). She talks to him \nabout three or four times a year (Tr. 26).  \n \nApplicant traveled to India in December 2002, December 2004, and January \n2008 (Tr. 26-27; SOR \u00b6 1.d of GE 7; GE 8). On each visit, she stayed in India for three \nor four weeks and visited her family (Tr. 27). She has not visited India since January \n2008, and does not have any plans to visit India (Tr. 28). \n \nIn December 2007, the Indian government issued to Applicant a lifelong Republic \nof India visa for Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI).2 She received her OCI visa after \nobtaining U.S. citizenship in October 2007 (Tr. 28; SOR \u00b6 1.e of GE 7; GE 8). At her \nhearing, she offered to provide her OCI visa to her security manager (Tr. 38). She \nrenounced her Indian citizenship (Tr. 39).  On August 17, 2009, she sent a letter to the \nIndian Consulate renouncing her OCI visa (AE K at 1). She provided a copy of her OCI \nvisa with a cancelled stamp on it (AE K at 2).   \n \nApplicant does not have any financial interests in India (Tr. 29). She owns four \nproperties in the United States (Tr. 30-34; AE B-E). She lives in one property, and the \nother three are residential rental properties. The total value of the four properties is \nabout $1,500,000 (Tr. 32-33). Her equity in her real estate properties is about $350,000 \n \n2See description of OCI status in the OCI section of this decision, infra at page 5. \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n(Tr. 38). Her U.S. 401K account is worth about $150,000 (Tr. 35). She also owns U.S. \nstocks valued at about $50,000 (Tr. 35-36). She and her husband\u2019s annual salaries total \nabout $200,000 (Tr. 36). Her husband is a software engineer (Tr. 37). \n \nAn Assistant Project Manager at Applicant\u2019s employer cited Applicant\u2019s strong \nties and allegiance to the United States and opined that she did not pose any risk to her \nproject (AE A). He believes a favorable decision \u201cwill greatly benefit our country by \nenabling her to contribute positively\u201d to the important endeavor she is working on for her \nemployer (AE A). Applicant volunteers her time to help others in her community (AE I).   \n \nApplicant emphasized her desire to be a good U.S. citizen because of the equity \nand fairness of the United States (Tr. 40). Her allegiance is to the United States (Tr. 40). \nIf someone from the Indian government contacted her and threatened to terminate her \nfather\u2019s pension unless she provided sensitive information, she would refuse to provide \nthe information and report the foreign contact to her security officer (Tr. 41).   \n \nIndia  \n \nIndia is a multiparty, parliamentary, federal, secular democracy with a population \nof 1.1 billion. It has 28 states and seven union territories. The United States and Indian \nrelationships have strengthened during the past 10 years. Previously, the relationship \nbetween the United States and India was strained by India\u2019s development of nuclear \nweapons in contravention of international conventions. \n \nThe United States recognizes India as key to its strategic interests and has \nsought to strengthen its relationship with India. The two countries are the world\u2019s largest \ndemocracies. Both countries are committed to political freedom as well as \nrepresentative government. They share common interests in the free flow of commerce, \nin fighting terrorism, and in the establishment of a strategically peaceful and stable Asia. \n \nCurrently, the United States is India\u2019s largest trading and investment partner. In \n2004, the United States and India agreed on multiple initiatives involving, energy, trade, \ndemocracy promotion, and disaster relief. In 2005, a joint statement between the two \ncountries noted that India should acquire the same benefits and advantages as other \nstates with advanced nuclear technology.  \n \nIn 2006, Congress passed the Henry J. Hyde United States - India Peaceful \nAtomic Cooperation Act, which allows direct civilian nuclear commerce between the \nUnited States and India. This agreement enables India to buy U.S. nuclear reactors and \nfuel for civilian use. Also, it removed and/or revised several U.S. export requirements for \ndual-use and civil nuclear items.  \n \nIn 2002, the United States began selling weapons systems to India. In 2007, a \nU.S. defense contractor negotiated a one billion dollar deal with India for the purchase \nof military transport aircraft along with related equipment, training and services. In \nJanuary 2008, the United States government approved the one billion dollar deal. \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nCurrently, U.S. defense contractors are competing with weapons manufacturers from \nother countries for a ten billion dollar contract to sell multi-role, combat aircraft to India. \n \nThe Indian government generally respects the rights of its citizens, but numerous \nserious human rights problems remain. Police and security forces have engaged in \nextrajudicial killings of persons in custody, disappearances, torture, and rape. The lack \nof accountability has permeated the government and security forces, creating an \natmosphere in which human rights violations have gone unpunished.  \n \nIndia is one of the most terror-afflicted countries in the world. In 2008, more than \n2300 people died from terrorist incidents in India. The attack in Mumbai in November \n2008 killed approximately 180 people. A number of other violent attacks have been \ncommitted in recent years by separatist and terrorist groups. Terrorism is concentrated \nin Kashmir, a disputed area bordering Pakistan where radical activists are present; \ncentral India, where Maoist rebels are fighting on behalf of landless laborers; and \nsouthern India, where Hindus and Muslims periodically clash. \n \nThe United States has some diplomatic disagreements with India. For example, \ndifferences over India\u2019s nuclear weapons program and pace of economic reform exist. \nThe United States is concerned about India\u2019s relationship with Iran, including India\u2019s \nincreasing cooperation with the Iranian military. \n \nThere have been some well-documented cases in the last several years involving \nthe illegal export, or attempted illegal export, of U.S. restricted, dual-use technology to \nIndia, including technology and equipment that were determined to present an \nunacceptable risk of diversion to programs for the development of weapons of mass \ndestruction or their means of delivery. Foreign government entities, including \nintelligence organizations and security services, have capitalized on private-sector \nacquisitions of U.S. technology, and acquisition of sensitive U.S. technology by foreign \nprivate entities does not slow its flow to foreign governments or its use in military \napplications. \n \nOverseas Citizenship of India (OCI) status3 \n \nThe Constitution of India does not allow one to hold Indian citizenship and \ncitizenship of a foreign country simultaneously. In 2006, India created the OCI status.  \nWith OCI status a person is not allowed to vote, hold constitutional office, or hold posts \nin the Indian government services sector. A person receiving OCI status does not \nreceive Indian citizenship along with OCI status. A person applying for OCI status must \nbe a citizen of a country that allows dual citizenship. There are other conditions and \nlimitations on approval of OCI status not pertinent to this decision. \n \n \n \n3A Consulate General of India information paper on Overseas Citizenship of India is the source \nfor the information in this section (AE H). See also ISCR Case No. 07-13232 at 4 (A.J. Mar. 31, 2008) \n(stating same), affirmed, ISCR Case No. 07-13232 at 2-3 (App. Bd. July 8, 2008).  \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). The government\u2019s authority to restrict access to \nclassified information applies similarly in the protection of sensitive, unclassified \ninformation. As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control access \nto information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual is \nsufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant eligibility for access to \nclassified information or sensitive information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified. This same \nstandard for access applies for those persons assigned to sensitive duties. Regulation \u00b6 \nC6.1.1.1    \n \nEligibility for a public trust position is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and \ncommonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d \nRegulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3. Department of Defense contractor \npersonnel are afforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any \nfinal unfavorable access determination may be made. Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1. \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to sensitive information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nsensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. See also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3. Thus, nothing in this decision \nshould be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on \nany express or implied determination as to applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. \nDenial is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident and the Secretary of Defense have established for granting access to \nsensitive information. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to sensitive information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness suitability. See ISCR Case No. \n95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her access to \nsensitive information].\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[trustworthiness] determinations \nshould err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude the relevant trustworthiness concern is under Guideline B (Foreign \nInfluence).  \n \nForeign Influence \n \n  \nAG \u00b6 6 explains the trustworthiness concern about \u201cforeign contacts and \ninterests\u201d stating: \n \nif the individual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, [he or \nshe] may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, group, \norganization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is \nvulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication \nunder this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign \ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, \nincluding, but not limited to, such considerations as whether the foreign \ncountry is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information.  \n \nApplicant was born and educated in India. In 1999, she and her husband \nimmigrated to the United States. In 2002, 2004 and 2008, she visited India for about \nthree or four weeks on each occasion. In 2007, she received an Indian OCI visa. She \nhas frequent contacts with her parents and less frequent contacts with her brother, who \nis a lieutenant in the Indian Armed Forces. Her father receives a pension from the \nIndian government.   \n \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person living in a foreign country \nor who is a citizen of a foreign country, is not, as a matter of law, disqualifying under \nGuideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country, and an Applicant \nhas contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for \nforeign influence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified or sensitive \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 03-02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case \nNo. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001).  \n \n\u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding \nclassified information from any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to \nhave access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has \ninterests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d4 The distinctions between friendly and \nunfriendly governments must be made with caution. Relations between nations can \nshift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. Furthermore, friendly nations can have \nprofound disagreements with the United States over matters they view as important to \ntheir vital interests or national security. Finally, we know friendly nations have engaged \nin espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, scientific, and \ntechnical fields. The nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United \nStates, the risk of terrorism, and its human rights record are relevant in assessing the \nlikelihood that an Applicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to coercion or \ninducements. The risk of coercion, persuasion, inducement, or duress is significantly \ngreater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family member is \nassociated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known to conduct \nintelligence collection operations again the United States. The relationship of India with \nthe United States, places a burden of persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that her \nand her husband\u2019s relationship with family members who are citizens of and living in \nIndia do not pose a security risk.  \n \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nApplicant should not be placed into a position where she might be forced to \nchoose between loyalty to the United States and a desire to protect his family members \nliving in India from harm, pressure, enticement, or coercion.5 With India\u2019s problematic \nhuman rights record, problems with terrorism, and industrial espionage as well as other \npolitical, economic and military problems in the country, it is conceivable that anyone \nliving in India might be targeted by governmental or non-governmental criminal or \nterrorist elements in an attempt to gather information from the United States. \n \nIndia has sought to illegally obtain sensitive technology from the United States. \nApplicant\u2019s connections to her family living in India raise a sufficient concern to require \ncareful scrutiny of all the facts and circumstances. An evaluation is necessary about any \npossible desire for her to assist relatives living in India by providing sensitive \ninformation.    \n \nDepartment Counsel produced substantial evidence of Applicant\u2019s contacts with \nher relatives who are citizens of or live in India to raise the issue of potential foreign \npressure or attempted exploitation. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) apply and further inquiry is \nnecessary about potential application of any mitigating conditions.  \n \nAG \u00b6 8 lists six conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns \nincluding: \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country \nis so minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected \nto resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest;  \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n5 An applicant with relatives in Iran, for example, has a much heavier burden to overcome than an \napplicant with relatives living in India. See ISCR Case No. 02-13595 at 3 (App. Bd. May 10, 2005) (stating \nan applicant has \u201ca very heavy burden of persuasion to overcome the security concerns\u201d when parents \nand siblings live in Iran). See also ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (articulating \n\u201cvery heavy burden\u201d standard when an applicant has family members living in Iran); ISCR Case No. 07-\n12471 at 9 (A.J. May 30, 2008) (listing numerous recent cases involving U.S. citizens with Iranian \nconnections whose clearances were denied, and citing no recent cases where the Appeal Board affirmed \nthe grant of a clearance for someone with immediate family members living in Iran). \n \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency \nrequirements regarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from \npersons, groups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(a) partially applies; however, AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(c), 8(d), and 8(e) do not apply \nbecause the U.S. government has not encouraged Applicant\u2019s involvement with Indian \ncitizens, her travel to India, or her other Indian connections. Applicant has frequent \ncontact with her father, mother, and brother. Additionally, Applicant has gone to India \nthree times in the last ten years. Her contacts with family members living in India are \nsufficiently frequent to raise the possibility of her being forced or induced to choose \nbetween the United States and the welfare of her relatives, who are citizens of or living \nin India. Applicant is not able to fully meet her burden of showing there is \u201clittle likelihood \nthat [her relationships with his relatives who are Indian citizens] could create a risk for \nforeign influence or exploitation.\u201d   \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) fully applies. There is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s relatives, who are \nIndian citizens or are living in India are or have been political activist(s), challenging the \npolicies of the Indian government. Her brother has served in India\u2019s armed forces for \ntwo years and is a lieutenant. Her father receives a pension from the Indian \ngovernment. There is, however, no evidence that terrorists, criminals, or the Indian \ngovernment have approached, attempted to induce or threatened Applicant or her \nrelatives living outside the United States for sensitive information. As such, there is a \nreduced possibility that her relatives living overseas or Applicant herself would be \ntargets for coercion, inducement, or exploitation. While the government does not have a \nburden to prove the presence of such evidence, if such record evidence were present, \nApplicant would have a very heavy evidentiary burden to overcome to mitigate foreign \ninfluence security concerns.   \n \nA key factor in the AG \u00b6 8(b) analysis is Applicant\u2019s \u201cdeep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S.\u201d She established that she \u201ccan be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d When she became a U.S. \ncitizen, her India citizenship was automatically revoked. When she learned the Indian \nOSI visa raised a security concern, she renounced it and it was cancelled. Applicant \nvoluntarily moved to the United States in 1999 with her husband. She resides in the \nUnited States, and did not express any intention of moving back to India. Her two \nchildren were both born in the United States, and she and her husband became U.S. \ncitizens. She has bank accounts, a 401(K) account, and four real estate properties in \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nthe United States, and she has no financial interests in India. Her employment is in the \nUnited States. She is a volunteer in her community.   \n  \nAG \u00b6 8(f) provides very limited mitigation even though Applicant does not have \nany financial interests in India. This mitigating condition can only mitigate AG \u00b6 7(e), \nwhich provides, \u201ca substantial business, financial, or property interest in a foreign \ncountry, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated business, which could subject the \nindividual to heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d  \n \nIn sum, Applicant\u2019s connections to India are less significant than her connections \nto the United States. Her connections to the United States taken together are sufficient \nto fully overcome the foreign influence security concerns.  Any residual foreign influence \nsecurity concerns are mitigated under the Whole Person Concept, infra. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance or public trust position by considering the \ntotality of the Applicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge \nshould consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance or public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline B in my whole person analysis. Some of the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional \ncomment. \n \nA Guideline B decision concerning India must take into consideration the \ngeopolitical situations in that country, as well as the dangers existing in India.6 Indian \ncitizens have sought to illegally obtain sensitive U.S. technology and information. It has \nserious economic, military, political, judicial/legal and social problems. India has a very \nsignificant problem with terrorism. If terrorists could obtain important information by \nthreatening or offering inducements to Applicant\u2019s relatives living in India, it is a \n \n6 See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd. May 23, 2007) (remanding because of insufficient \ndiscussion of geopolitical situation and suggesting expansion of whole person discussion). \n  \n\n \n12 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \n                                           \nreasonable possibility that terrorists or possibly other Indian entities would take those \nactions.       \n \nThe United States\u2019 relationship with India has substantially improved during this \ndecade. The United States has accepted India as a nuclear power, and the two \ncountries are working together to decrease the risk of nuclear proliferation. The United \nStates is India\u2019s largest trading and investment partner. India is the world\u2019s largest \ndemocracy. The United States and India work closely together to fight terrorism. The \nUnited States sells advanced military equipment to India. The positive connections \nmake it less likely that India would use Applicant or her relatives living in India to \nattempt to obtain sensitive information from Applicant.      \n \nApplicant has a significant relationship with India and has frequent contacts with \nher parents and brother living in India. Applicant lived in India from 1974 to 1999, and \nreceived her education in India. Her husband is from India. She traveled to India three \ntimes in the last ten years. Her brother is a lieutenant in the Indian armed forces, and \nher father is receiving a pension from India. She held an Indian passport and Indian OCI \nvisa in the past.7 However, she has relinquished her Indian passport, renounced her \nOCI visa, and her India citizenship was automatically revoked when she became a U.S. \ncitizen. \n \nApplicant has a stronger relationship with the United States than to India \nbecause she has chosen to live, and has lived, the last ten years in the United States. \nShe has sworn allegiance to the United States as part of her citizenship ceremony. The \nUnited States has provided her employment. She pays taxes to the United States. Her \nhusband and two children are U.S. citizens. I find her statements about her preference \nfor the United States over India to be credible. \n \nApplicant provided a letter from a supervisor about her dedication, responsibility, \ntrustworthiness and professionalism. Although the possibility of attempted exploitation of \nApplicant is relatively low, Applicant\u2019s strong connections to the United States and \nespecially to her U.S. community and employment establish \u201csuch deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., [she] can be expected to resolve \nany conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d  See AG \u00b6 8(b).  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and \ncircumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude she has mitigated \ntrustworthiness concerns pertaining to foreign influence. I take this position based on \n \n7Applicant\u2019s connections to India are similar to the connections of the Applicant in ISCR Case No. \n07-13232 (App. Bd. July 8, 2008). In that case, the Appeal Board unanimously affirmed the decision \ngranting that Applicant a security clearance. In ISCR Case No. 07-13232, the Applicant was born in India, \nheld and then relinquished an Indian OCI visa and passport, and his parents, siblings, and in-laws were \ncitizens and residents of India. Id. at 2. The Applicant and his wife went to India four times in the recent \npast to visit their parents. Id. His father was receiving a pension from the Indian government. ISCR Case \nNo. 07-13232 at 3 (A.J. Mar. 31, 2008). His brother was an engineer employed by an Indian state \ngovernment. Id. at 3. Applicant\u2019s connections to the United States in ISCR Case No. 07-13232 are similar \nto the Applicant\u2019s connections in ADP Case No. 08-08567.  \n\n \n13 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nthe law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful \nconsideration of the whole person factors\u201d and supporting evidence, my application of \nthe pertinent factors under the Adjudicative Process, and my interpretation of my \nresponsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant has mitigated or overcome the \ngovernment\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude she is eligible to occupy a public \ntrust position. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:    \n \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.e: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant or continue Applicant eligibility for a \npublic trust position. Eligibility for a public trust position is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Administrative Judge:\nOn September 30, 2010, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns arising under\nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct). An amended SOR, dated November 18, 2010, added\nsecurity concerns under Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the Adjudicative Guidelines (AG). \nOn October 25, 2010, Applicant answered the original SOR and requested a\nhearing. DOHA assigned the case to me on December 23, 2010. DOHA issued a\nNotice of Hearing on January 26, 2011, and I convened the hearing on February 15,\n2011. Department Counsel offered four exhibits, which were admitted as Government\nExhibits (GE) 1-4. Applicant testified, presented two witnesses, and submitted three\nexhibits (AE) A through C which were admitted into the record. DOHA received the\ntranscript on February 28, 2011. Based on a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nApril 6, 2011\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nIn his answer to the amended SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegation\nunder Guideline J (Criminal Activity), and denied the factual allegation under Guideline\nE (Personal Conduct).\nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\ncollege in 1986 and obtained a graduate degree in 2001. Applicant is married and has\nno children. He has worked for his current employer since 2006. Applicant served in the\ninformation technology field with defense contractors from 1991 for 15 years. He held a\nsecurity clearance from 1994 until 2007, when it was denied by another agency. His\ninterim security clearance was withdrawn in 2008. (GE 3)\nCriminal Conduct\nApplicant owns a gun collection, including antique guns such as rifles, shotguns,\nand pistols. He began purchasing guns in his late 20s. (Tr. 38) He admitted that he\nillegally carried pistols, with varying frequency, (sometimes daily), from 1991 until about\nthe summer of 2006. Applicant had a permit for a firearm in one state but not for the\nstates in which he carried the concealed pistols.\nApplicant\u2019s explanation for carrying a firearm was because he \u201cstarted hanging\nout with the self-defense crowd\u201d (police officers and \u201cpeople who were in the concealed\ncarry movement\u201d). (Tr. 19) He also explained that he taught martial arts and attended\ntraining classes (defensive pistol classes). Everyone he met was carrying a gun and he\ndecided to do the same thing. He referred to a \u201clifestyle\u201d and a community of people\nwho realized how ineffective hands are against a weapon for safety. (Tr. 57) He also\nadmitted that he knew it was illegal. (Tr. 19) \nAt the hearing, Applicant recalled that on September 11, 2001, he was not\ncarrying a gun, but thought it would be a good day to have one. (Tr. 44) He does not\nrecall when he actually stopped carrying guns on a regular basis. (Tr. 18) He also\nacknowledged that he probably carried a weapon to work on some occasions. (Tr. 47)\nApplicant believed that since he was trained and highly proficient with a gun, if there\nwere a \u201cdeadly situation,\u201d he would be better off with a gun. (Tr. 60) He was adamant\nthat he never touched a gun when he drank alcohol. \nApplicant stated that he stopped carrying a concealed weapon prior to\nSeptember 2001, but in 2006 he again carried an illegal firearm. (Tr. 20) He attributes\nthat action to a mugging that happened to him. He stated that he started to take a gun\nto work the next day, but decided to leave the gun in the car. He acknowledged that\nwas the last time he carried a concealed weapon. Applicant was never arrested or\ncharged with any crime. (Tr. 22) \nApplicant applied for sensitive compartmented information (SCI) access in\nOctober 2006. During the investigation, Applicant was given a polygraph. In response to\n\n3\na question about any felony offenses, he recalled that he had carried a handgun with\nhim without having a license to do so, and told the polygraph technician. (GE 2)\nAt the hearing, Applicant acknowledged that his security clearance is important\nto him so that he can keep the job that he enjoys. He stated that he never realized his\nbehavior was endangering his security clearance. He believes that he is an asset to the\nGovernment. (Tr. 33) When questioned about future intentions concerning illegally\ncarrying a gun, he thought \u201chow can you ever guarantee anything like that.\u201d He states\nthat it is not part of his lifestyle anymore, but he also recognizes that it is illegal. (Tr. 34)\nHe noted that it was wrong to do what he did. He does not want to break the law.\nApplicant provided three letters of recommendation from friends and students.\nThey attest to his responsibility, integrity and judgment. Each characterizes Applicant as\nan honest and candid person who is a good role model. (AE A-C)\nAt the hearing, Applicant\u2019s supervisor testified that she has known him for two or\nthree years. (Tr. 68) His supervisor describes Applicant as reliable and honest with\ngood insight. Applicant\u2019s supervisor noted that Applicant has a good reputation in the\ncompany and follows company law.(Tr. 72) She acknowledged that most defense\ncontractors have a \u201cno weapons\u201d policy.\nA retired military officer and friend of Applicant testified that he has known\nApplicant since 1994. Applicant taught martial arts, and his friend was once a student of\nApplicant. He describes Applicant as an \u201cupright\u201d guy. (Tr. 77) Applicant\u2019s friend knows\nabout the security concerns at issue and that his clearance was denied. Applicant\u2019s\nfriend also reported that he has never seen Applicant carry a weapon. He recommends\nApplicant for retention of a security clearance. \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, an\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions. These guidelines are not inflexible\nrules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, they are applied\nin conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. An administrative\njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), this process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables\nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d An administrative judge must consider all\navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and\nunfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\n\n See also ISCR Case No. 94-1075 at 3-4 (App. Bd.

Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. An applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to\nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by\nDepartment Counsel. . . .\u201d  The burden of proof is something less than a\n1\npreponderance of evidence.  The ultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant.  \n2\n3\nA person seeking access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect classified information. Such\ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, rather\nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  \u201cThe clearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance\n4\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt\n5\nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to sensitive information must be\nresolved in favor of protecting such information.  The decision to deny an individual a\n6\nsecurity clearance does not necessarily reflect badly on an applicant\u2019s character. It is\nmerely an indication that the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President\nand the Secretary of Defense established for issuing a clearance.\nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\n\n5\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;\n(b) discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces under dishonorable\nconditions;\n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted;\n(d) individual is currently on parole or probation; and\n(e) violation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a court-\nmandated rehabilitation program.\nApplicant\u2019s admission that he carried a concealed weapon, without having a\nlicense, from 1991 until the summer of 2006, with varying frequency, is sufficient to\nraise AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c).\nAG \u00b6 32 provides four conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and\nthose pressures are no longer present in the person's life;\n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement; and,\nAfter reviewing the mitigating conditions, I find that none of them apply in this\ncase. Applicant\u2019s illegal carrying of a handgun is behavior that has been longstanding\nand continuous. He acknowledged that it may happen again - or that there is no\nguarantee that it will not happen again. He knew his behavior was illegal but it did not\nstop him. His last incident was in 2006. Based on the record evidence and Applicant\u2019s\ntestimony, I find that he has not mitigated the security concern under criminal conduct.  \n\n6\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect\nclassified information.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;\n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information concerning\nrelevant facts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent\nmedical authority, or other official government representative;\n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is\nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single\nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not\nproperly safeguard protected information;\n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any\nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse\ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the\nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes\nbut is not limited to consideration of:\n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of\nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information,\nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or other\ngovernment protected information:\n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the\nworkplace; \n\n7\n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and\n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other\nemployer's time or resources.\n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct,\nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such\nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's\npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another\ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is\nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a\nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence\nservice or other group;\n(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to\nthe employer as a condition of employment; and\n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity. \nApplicant\u2019s poor judgment over a period of many years gives rise to disqualifying\ncondition AG \u00b6 16(e). He knowingly broke the law, sometimes on a daily, basis until\n2006. He held a security clearance during that time. He admitted that he sometimes\ntook the weapon to work, which was against company policy. His conduct shows a\npattern of dishonesty and rule violations.\nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;\n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was\ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of\nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual\nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made\naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the\nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully;\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur;\n\n8\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;\n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable\nreliability; and\n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or\noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules\nand regulations.\nApplicant admitted that he illegally carried a handgun from 1991 until 2006\nduring an investigation. He disclosed this information for the first time during a\npolygraph test in 2006. This illegal behavior occurred over a long period of time. It was\nnot a minor offense or an isolated one. His behavior has shown a disregard for laws\nand regulations. I have doubts about his judgment and reliability. \nAfter considering the mitigating conditions outlined in AG \u00b6 17, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concern under personal conduct. \nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. As noted above, the\nultimate burden of persuasion is on the applicant seeking a security clearance. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, as well as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d\nfactors. Applicant is a contractor who has held a security clearance since 1994. He has\ngood references and his current employer recommends him. He is an educated, mature\nindividual. He has letters of recommendation. His security clearance is currently\nsuspended.\n\n9\nApplicant states that the last time he carried a concealed weapon was in the\nsummer of 2006. He has not had any arrests or incidents of security violation. However,\ndespite his claim that he will follow the law in the future, I have doubts about his\njudgment and reliability. Any doubts must be resolved in favor of the Government.\nApplicant has not met his burden in this case. He has not mitigated the security\nconcerns under criminal conduct and personal conduct. Clearance is denied.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.\nClearance is denied. \n                                                     \nNOREEN A.

After a thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is a 47-year-old planner-buyer who has been employed by a defense contractor since June 2007.3 She attended college from September 1998 to May 2000. It is not clear from her security clearance application whether she received a degree or diploma. Applicant married her spouse in 1981, and they have three adult children, ages 31, 26, and 25. Applicant has been employed from October 1989 to the present, except for two periods of unemployment from November 2001 to February 2002, and from June 2004 to November 2004. She worked for private companies, two government contractors, and was self-employed for some time. She worked for the first government contractor from June 2003 to June 2004. She was hired by the second government contractor in June 2007, and has worked for that company since. In her 2008 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed she had four debts that were currently over 90 days delinquent.

Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn May 14, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP).1 On April 30, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to her, pursuant to \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated \nFebruary 20, 1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), \n \n1  FORM Item 4. \n \nSeptember 18, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                           \ndated January 2, 1992, as amended, modified, and revised.2 The SOR alleges a \nsecurity concern under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The SOR detailed \nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the \nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for her, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be denied or revoked. \n \nOn June 1, 2009, Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR was received by DOHA. She \nelected to have her case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing (Item 3). A \ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM), dated June 19, 2009, was \nprovided to her by letter dated June 22, 2009. Applicant received the FORM on June \n29, 2009. She was afforded a period of 30 days to file objections and submit material in \nrefutation, extenuation, or mitigation. She did not submit any materials, comments, or \nobjections in response to the FORM. The case was assigned to me on September 4, \n2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all the factual allegations in the SOR, except for SOR \u00b6 1.f, \nwhich she denied. Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \nthorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of \nfact.   \n \nApplicant is a 47-year-old planner-buyer who has been employed by a defense \ncontractor since June 2007.3 She attended college from September 1998 to May 2000. \nIt is not clear from her security clearance application whether she received a degree or \ndiploma. Applicant married her spouse in 1981, and they have three adult children, ages \n31, 26, and 25.  \n \nApplicant has been employed from October 1989 to the present, except for two \nperiods of unemployment from November 2001 to February 2002, and from June 2004 \nto November 2004. She worked for private companies, two government contractors, \nand was self-employed for some time. She worked for the first government contractor \nfrom June 2003 to June 2004. She was hired by the second government contractor in \nJune 2007, and has worked for that company since.  \n \nIn her 2008 security clearance application, Applicant disclosed she had four \ndebts that were currently over 90 days delinquent. She also disclosed she was having \nfinancial problems resulting from the decline of her spouse\u2019s work schedule, and that \nshe was trying to resolve her delinquent debts.  \n \n2  On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guidelines to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006.  \n \n3  Item 4 (2008 e-QIP) is the source for the facts in this decision, unless stated otherwise. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed her financial problems. The SOR \nalleges seven delinquent and/or charged-off accounts totaling approximately $36,000. \nThe delinquent debts were established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and her two credit \nreports (Items 5 and 6).4 Most of the debts have been delinquent since around 2006-\n2007. Applicant denied SOR \u00b6 1.f stating that the debt was resolved many years ago. \nShe presented no documentary evidence to support her claim. \n \nApplicant attributed her financial problems to a number of related events (Item 7). \nShe and her husband purchased a home in 2007. Additionally, they took an equity loan \nto make repairs to the home, they made loans to purchase furniture, and they incurred \nsignificant additional credit card debt, and obtained at least five small personal loans. \nDuring the 2007 winter, her spouse was unemployed for an unknown period because \nthe ownership in his company changed, and because the harsh winter prevented him \nfrom working.  \n \nMany of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are from credit card accounts that became \ndelinquent around 2006-2007. During her 2008 interview, she did not know the balance \non her delinquent accounts. Applicant claimed she has been in contact with the \ncreditors and that the accounts are on hold. She presented no documentary evidence to \ncorroborate her claims. Applicant\u2019s financial problems appear to be the result of her \nextensive use of her credit and her husband\u2019s inability to work. \n \nApplicant promised to pay all her delinquent debts. She stated she was caught \nup with her bills and was current in paying what she owes. She intends to pay her \ndelinquent accounts one at a time, starting by paying the smallest debts first. She \npresented payment receipts for three debts paid around October 2008 (Item 8). Two of \nthe debts concerned small personal loans she obtained. Other than these accounts, \nApplicant presented little evidence of other paid debts, settlement agreements, or efforts \nto resolve her delinquent debts since she acquired them.  \n \nApplicant believes she can negotiate settlements with all her creditors within two \nyears. She considered using a debt consolidation company, but discounted the idea \nbecause of the additional fees she would have to pay. Applicant believes she is not \nsusceptible to blackmail, coercion, or pressure because her family knows about her \nfinancial problems.  \n \nApplicant presented no evidence concerning her current financial situation (i.e., \nsalary, deductions, expenses, debts, a working budget), or about how she is going to \nprevent similar financial problems in the future. She presented no evidence that she has \nparticipated in any financial counseling.  \n \n \n4  An applicant\u2019s credit report showing the delinquent debts alleged in an SOR is sufficient to \nestablish the government\u2019s prima facie case. See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2003). \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                           \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). The \nadjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, \nwhich are required to be considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d5 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by department counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \ngovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).6 \n \n \n5  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable \nmind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit \nAuth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n6  \u201cThe administrative judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n5 \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nUnder Guideline F, the security concern is that an applicant\u2019s failure or inability to \nlive within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor \nself-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of \nwhich can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of \nhaving to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. AG \u00b6 18. \n \nApplicant has accumulated seven delinquent and/or charged-off accounts \ntotaling approximately $36,000, most of which have been outstanding since around \n2006-2007. Applicant\u2019s evidence of efforts to resolve her financial obligations is limited \nto her payment of three debts around October 2008. Two of the debts concerned small \npersonal loans she obtained. Other than these payments, Applicant presented no other \nevidence of efforts to pay or resolve any of the financial obligations alleged in the SOR.  \n \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, and AG \u00b6 19(c): a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations, apply in this case.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20 lists six conditions that could mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; and \n \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s sparse favorable evidence fails to fully raise the applicability of any \nmitigating condition. Her financial problems are ongoing and her evidence fails to show \nthey occurred under such circumstances that they are unlikely to recur and do not cast \ndoubt on Applicant's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) \ndoes not apply. \n \n \nApplicant presented some evidence to establish circumstances beyond her \ncontrol contributing to her inability to pay her debts, i.e., her and her husband\u2019s periods \nof unemployment. Notwithstanding, her financial problems appear to be the result of her \nextensive use of her credit and her husband\u2019s inability to work for a period. Applicant\u2019s \nevidence of efforts to resolve her financial obligations is limited to her paying three \ndebts in 2008, not alleged in the SOR. She presented no other evidence of efforts to \npay or resolve any of the financial obligations alleged in the SOR. Applicant has been \nconsistently employed since November 2004. Her favorable information fails to fully \nestablish a track record of financial responsibility. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply because there are not clear indications that her \nfinancial problems are being resolved or are under control. She presented no evidence \nthat she received financial counseling. Considering the number of delinquent debts, the \ndate the debts were acquired, the aggregate value of the debts, and the lack of \nevidence of efforts to resolve her financial obligations, Applicant\u2019s information is \ninsufficient to establish that her financial problems are unlikely to recur. The remaining \nmitigating conditions are not reasonably raised by the facts in this case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. Applicant receives credit for her four years working for \ngovernment contractors. There is no evidence of any security violation, or that she ever \ncompromised classified information. Applicant appears to be a valuable employee and a \ngood mother and wife. These factors show some responsibility and mitigation. \nNotwithstanding, security concerns remain about Applicant\u2019s current financial \nresponsibility, reliability, and judgment. Applicant\u2019s financial problems appear to be \ncaused by her extensive use of her credit and her husband\u2019s inability to work. She has \nfailed to show good-faith efforts to resolve her financial problems in a timely manner. \nThe record evidence fails to convince me of Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns arising from her financial considerations.  \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue eligibility for a security \nclearance for Applicant. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n____________________________ \nJUAN J. RIVERA \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant showed poor judgment in abusing his prescription for Ritalin in 2004,\nincluding at work in July 2004. He is on probation until June 2011 following his guilty\nplea in February 2008 to negligent homicide, reckless endangerment, assault, and\ninterfering with police in October 2004, and to a September 2004 operating under the\ninfluence (OUI) offense. Future drug abuse is unlikely, but he has not fully mitigated the\ncriminal conduct concerns. Clearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case\nApplicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF 86) on August 19,\n2003. On October 31, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guideline J and Guideline H that provided the basis for its action to deny him a\nsecurity clearance and refer the matter to an administrative judge. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\nMay 07, 2009\n\n2\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense as of\nSeptember 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on November 21, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before a DOHA administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on January\n6, 2009. On January 29, 2009, I scheduled a hearing for February 19, 2009.\nI convened the hearing as scheduled. The government submitted six exhibits\n(Ex. 1-6). Exhibits 1-4, and Exhibit 6 were admitted in full without any objections. Exhibit\n5 was admitted in part, as I sustained Applicant\u2019s objection to inclusion of a newspaper\narticle appended to an adverse information report. Department Counsel had included\nthe page to explain the processing of the case and he indicated he was not relying on\nany of the statements in the article to support the SOR allegations. Two Applicant\nexhibits (Ex. A-B) were admitted in full. Department Counsel objected only to the last\npage of Exhibit B, consisting of fatal crash statistics for the years 1997 through 2005 as\nreported by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Applicant offered it for\nthe purposes of showing that the fatal accident he caused was an unfortunate but not\nunusual circumstance. I admitted the document for that limited purpose while advising\nApplicant of its limited relevance to his particular case. Applicant and three professional\ncolleagues (two supervisors and his technical lead) testified on his behalf, as reflected\nin a transcript (Tr.) received on March 3, 2009.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nBy facsimile on February 27, 2009, Applicant forwarded for inclusion in the\nrecord a post-hearing memorandum with a case status report concerning his completion\nof an Employee Assistance Program (EAP) in 2004 (Enclosure 1) and information\nrepresented to be from a university health center\u2019s website about reactions to, and\nmeans of coping with, traumatic events (Enclosure 2). The document was marked\ncollectively for identification as Exhibit C. On March 2, 2009, I ordered the government\nto respond on or before March 13, 2009. On March 12, 2009, Department Counsel\nobjected to the admission of Enclosure 2 on the basis it was an incomplete Internet\narticle that even if printed from a health center\u2019s website, lacked authorship, any\nidentification of the medical credentials of the author, or a date, and was irrelevant to\nApplicant\u2019s case. Information about possible reactions to, and ways of coping with,\ntraumatic events could aid in explaining Applicant\u2019s response to the negligent homicide\nat issue in SOR \u00b6 1.c, so I find little merit in the government\u2019s claim that it is irrelevant.\nHowever, the document in its present form is not self-authenticating and fails to satisfy\nthe official or business record requirement for admission under \u00b6 E.3.1.20 of the\n\nApplicant\u2019s post-hearing memorandum and Department Counsel\u2019s response consisted largely of\n1\nargument. For example,  Applicant indicated Department Counsel was \u201cway out of line in his closing argument\u201d\n when he stated Applicant showed no remorse for the October 2004 fatal accident. Department Counsel\ncontended the facts of the October 2004 negligent homicide established criminal negligence with a motor\nvehicle, a class D felony under state law, even though Applicant was charged with negligent homicide, a\nmisdemeanor. Such arguments were not considered as evidence. However, it is appropriate for Counsel to\nargue lack of remorse, or that conduct meets the elements for a felony.\n3\nDirective. I sustain the government\u2019s objection to Enclosure 2, and admit Exhibit C in\npart.1\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline J (criminal conduct) that Applicant\u2019s operator\u2019s\nlicense was suspended after he was charged with evading responsibility and reckless\ndriving in about 1996 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that he was convicted of a September 2004 driving\nwhile intoxicated offense (SOR \u00b6 1.b); that he was arrested for, and pleaded guilty to\nOctober 2004 charges of negligent homicide with a motor vehicle, reckless\nendangerment in the first degree, assault in the third degree, and interfering with an\nofficer/resisting arrest (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and that he was found guilty of a January 2006\npossession of marijuana charge (SOR \u00b6 1.d). Applicant was alleged under Guideline H\nto have abused Ritalin at work in July 2004 (SOR \u00b6 2.a). Also, the marijuana possession\ncharge was cross-alleged under Guideline H (SOR \u00b6 2.b).\nApplicant submitted a lengthy response to the allegations, which included 21\nenclosures. The enclosures were formally admitted into evidence at the hearing as\nExhibit A. In his Answer, Applicant indicated that the 1996 charge (SOR \u00b6 1.a) was\nresolved by a guilty plea to a single misdemeanor motor vehicle count of evading\nresponsibility. He admitted pleading guilty to the September 2004 drunk driving charge\nin February 2008 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Applicant also acknowledged that he had been involved\nin a fatal automobile accident in October 2004. However, while he was charged\ncriminally in July 2005 with, in part, manslaughter II with a motor vehicle and\nmisconduct with a motor vehicle, he averred he pleaded guilty in February 2008 to\nmisdemeanor motor vehicle charges of negligent homicide with a motor vehicle,\nreckless endangerment I, assault III, and interfering with an officer (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and that\nhe was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the \u201cvery freak and\ntragic accident for which [he has] struggled with [sic] ever since the day it has occurred.\u201d\nAs for the marijuana possession offense (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 2.b), Applicant denied he was\nconvicted because the charge was dismissed after he completed a pretrial drug\nprogram. Applicant expressed his belief that the drug involvement guideline did not\napply to the marijuana possession since he did not plead guilty. While he made no\nexcuse for abusing the Ritalin at work (SOR \u00b6 2.a), the drug was legally prescribed for\nhim and he had not taken it since that day. After considering the evidence of record, I\nmake the following findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 31-year-old electrical engineer, who has worked for a defense\ncontractor since August 2003 (Ex. 1), with the exception of a few months in 2008. He\n\n4\nseeks to retain a secret-level security clearance that was granted to him in December\n2003 (Ex. 5).\nIn about 1996, when Applicant was 17, he sideswiped another vehicle and drove\noff. He was driving his father\u2019s vehicle and was scared (Tr. 54). He turned himself in to\nthe police after speaking to his parents, and was charged with evading responsibility\nand reckless driving. He pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor evading responsibility\ncharge, and his driver\u2019s license was suspended for four months. The reckless driving\ncharge was dismissed. Applicant was also sued civilly for the damage and his insurance\nsettled (Exs. 1, 2).\nApplicant earned his bachelor of science degree in electrical engineering in\nAugust 2003 and started working for his current employer. On August 19, 2003, he\nexecuted a security clearance application (SF 86) for a secret-level security clearance.\nUncertain how he should respond to question 26 concerning any police record (other\noffenses) in the last seven years, Applicant consulted with his attorney, who advised\nhim to indicate \u201cMotor Vehicle Violations.\u201d(Ex. B). Applicant disclosed on his SF 86 that\nhe had been charged with a \u201cMOVING VIOLATION\u201d in December 1997, but also that it\nhad been \u201cDROPPED IN COURT.\u201d He reported the insurance settlement in response to\nquestion 40, concerning any civil court actions in the last seven years (Ex. 1). Applicant\nwas granted his secret clearance in December 2003 (Ex. 5). Applicant claimed that he\ndid not know until 2004 that he had been convicted of evading responsibility (\u201cI thought\neverything was dropped.\u201d Tr. 57).\n \nSuffering from severe insomnia and depression in 2004, Applicant began\ntreatment under the care of a medical professional who prescribed psychotropic\nmedications, including Ritalin, and counseling (Ex. 2). Applicant began taking Ritalin\nthat spring in capsule form. He abused the drug on occasion by taking the capsules\napart and snorting the drug, initially only at home. During the second week of July 2004,\nhe began snorting Ritalin in a lavatory at work (Ex. 6). Inhalation gave him \u201ca rush\u201d that\nlasted for about three hours, and allowed him to work at a time when he wasn\u2019t sleeping\n(Tr. 82).\nOn July 14, 2004, Applicant\u2019s manager happened to be in the lavatory before\nnoon when he saw and heard evidence that led him to suspect illegal drug abuse. He\nwatched as Applicant exited the lavatory, and reported him to their employer. During an\ninterview by a company investigator on July 15, 2004, Applicant admitted he had\nsnorted Ritalin on the property the day before, and on three or four occasions before\nthat, in the same bathroom. He also admitted that he had taken three capsules with him\non the morning of the interview and had saved the third so that he could snort the drug\nat work, but he was approached by security before he could use it. He turned the\ncapsule over to security, and the code on the pill was consistent with his admission of\nRitalin abuse. Applicant took a drug test, which was negative for substances tested\n(amphetamines, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine and marijuana metabolites,\nmethadone, opiates, and PCP, Ex. B), and he was suspended from work pending the\noutcome of the investigation. He turned over a prescription vial showing his Ritalin\n\n5\nmedication had been filled on July 8, 2004, for a quantity of 60 20-mg. capsules to be\ntaken at two each morning. Based on the number of capsules remaining (20), 24 pills\nwere missing (Ex. 6). Applicant believes he took more than the prescribed amount of\nRitalin (Tr. 81). He was suspended from work without pay for one week, given a written\nwarning, and required to take counseling classes through his company\u2019s EAP (Tr. 82).\nHe completed the sessions on September 15, 2004 (Ex. C). Applicant indicates that he\nstopped abusing Ritalin after he was caught (Answer, Ex. 2), and there is no evidence\nproving otherwise. \nAround that same time, Applicant changed his treating physician because he did\nnot agree with the clinician\u2019s diagnosis of bipolar disorder. His new psychiatrist placed\nhim on Zoloft for depression. Applicant was also prescribed a sleeping aid for his\nchronic insomnia, and he was taking one as of October 2004 (Ex. 2, Tr. 103-04). \nIn September 2004, Applicant was pulled over shortly after leaving a bar where\nhe had been drinking with friends. The officer detected an odor of alcohol. Applicant\nsubmitted a motor vehicle registration that had expired in February 2004 and he was\nunable to perform field sobriety tests correctly. He was arrested for operating while\nunder the influence (OUI) and taken to the station, where an initial breathalyzer showed\na .185% blood alcohol content. He was charged with OUI, failure to drive in established\nlane, and failure to carry insurance card (Ex. 3). Applicant pleaded not guilty to OUI,\ncontending that he was pulled over for no reason and had passed the field sobriety test\n(Ex. 2). \nWhile the OUI charge was pending against him, Applicant was involved in a fatal\ntraffic accident in mid-October 2004. En route home from work at around 1830 hours,\nApplicant veered off the highway onto the right shoulder and struck a 28-year-old\nwoman who was changing a tire on the passenger side of her vehicle. The victim\nsuccumbed to her injuries. Applicant was taken by the state police to the hospital for\nobservation, where a toxicology report was negative for alcohol (Ex. A). Applicant\ndenies he was impaired by his prescription medications at the time (Tr. 77) or that he\nfell asleep. He still has no explanation for what led him to drive off the road (Tr. 72-73).\nFour days later, Applicant\u2019s employer filed an adverse information report with the\nDefense Industrial Security Clearance Office (Ex. 5). In July 2005, Applicant was\ncharged with manslaughter III, a class C felony, misconduct with a motor vehicle, a\nclass D felony, and two violations of motor vehicle laws: failing to drive in proper lane,\nand reckless driving (Ex. A). Sometime before May 2007, his OUI case was transferred\nto be handled with the October 2004 charges (Ex. 2).\nApplicant\u2019s vehicle was impounded as a result of the October 2004 incident, and\nmarijuana was found, apparently behind the car stereo. Applicant denies knowing\npossession of the drug, but he was charged criminally with illegal possession of\n\nApplicant testified with no rebuttal from the government that his car was in the possession of the state\n2\npolice from the date of the October 2004 fatal accident until 2006 when they charged him with possession of\nmarijuana. He continues to adamantly deny that the marijuana was his (Tr. 48). He had no explanation for how\nthe marijuana ended up behind his car stereo (\u201cI had about 300 CD\u2019s stolen from me. The car was totally\ncompromised. You\u2019re talking about a stock car stereo that\u2019s bolted in. W hy would they unbolt a car stereo?\nThen they found a vial. I never saw the vial.\u201d). (Tr. 53).\nApplicant served as a judge for a student invention convention in late April 2007 for a period of eight\n3\nhours (Ex. A). It is unclear whether this fulfilled part of his community service requirement.\nApplicant explained the charge as due to the fact that his account of the accident did not agree with\n4\nthe investigating officers, that the state police \u201cchose to leave a lot of information out of the police report.\u201d (Tr.\n91).\n6\nmarijuana in late December 2005 or early January 2006 (Ex. 2).  On January 9, 2007,\n2\nApplicant\u2019s case was continued for one year to allow him to complete a pretrial drug\neducation program. Applicant satisfactorily completed a 12-hour drug program on March\n20, 2007, and 30 hours of community service (Exs. 2, A).  The marijuana possession\n3\ncharge was dismissed on January 9, 2008 (Answer, Ex. A).\nOn June 1, 2007, Applicant was interviewed by an Office of Personnel\nManagement (OPM) investigator about his treatment for depression and insomnia, his\narrest record, and the status of pending charges. Applicant explained that he took\nprescribed Zoloft for depression from 2004 to fall 2006, but his depression had resolved.\nHe was currently on Seroquel nightly and a generic tranquilizer because he was\nsleeping only two to three hours a night (Ex. 2). Concerning his use of Ritalin at work in\nJuly 2004, Applicant admitted he had been caught abusing prescribed Ritalin in the\nlavatory. He attributed his abuse of his prescription to being \u201cnot in the right state of\nmind.\u201d While he admitted he had abused Ritalin in the same manner once or twice\nbefore, he denied snorting it at work before that occasion. Concerning the September\n2004 OUI charge, Applicant claimed he passed the filed sobriety tests as proved by a\nvideo in his attorneys\u2019 possession. He denied any excessive consumption or adverse\nimpacts from his alcohol use. With respect to the October 2004 accident, Applicant\nindicated that the victim\u2019s family had been paid $500,000 in an insurance settlement but\nthat the family \u201cpressured the state police to charge [him].\u201d He indicated he would be\noffering a plea in return for no felony convictions. Applicant denied any knowing\npossession of the marijuana found in his vehicle while it was impounded. He expected\nthe charge to be dismissed since he had completed a pretrial drug program. As for the\n1996 evading responsibility charge, Applicant told the OPM investigator that he had\n\u201cunknowingly sideswiped another car.\u201d  (Ex. 2).\nOn Applicant\u2019s behalf, his attorney continued to engage in plea negotiations to\nresolve the September 2004 OUI and October 2004 manslaughter and other charges.\nDespite the request of the victim\u2019s family that Applicant be sentenced to a lengthier jail\nterm, the state accepted his offer to plead guilty to misdemeanor offenses. In late\nFebruary 2008, Applicant pleaded guilty to substituted charges of negligent homicide\nwith a motor vehicle, reckless endangerment (first degree), assault (third degree), and\ninterfering with an officer.  He was sentenced on the negligent homicide count to six\n4\n\nThe client evaluation lists a .13% blood alcohol content (BAC) for the OUI, apparently based on\n5\nApplicant\u2019s self-report (Ex. A). The police report indicates his BAC tested at .185% and then .170% (Ex. 3).\nThe state\u2019s attorney cited those breathalyzer results when Applicant entered his plea in February 2008 (Ex.\nA).  Applicant could have chosen to litigate those breathalyzer results in court and chose not to.\n7\nmonths in jail, suspended after 98 days, and placed on probation for two years. On each\nof the three remaining charges, he was sentenced to one year in jail, execution\nsuspended, and placed on probation for three years. Applicant entered a guilty plea as\nwell to the September 2004 OUI. He was sentenced to six months in jail, execution\nsuspended after two days, placed on two years probation with conditions, and ordered\nto pay a $500 fine (Exs. 4, A). The jail sentences were to run consecutively for a total\neffective sentence of four years, execution suspended after 100 days (two days of the\nmandatory term suspended), and three years of probation with the following conditions:\nalcohol evaluation and treatment as deemed necessary by the probation office; three\nyears license suspension; a $2,500 charitable donation to a charity of the victim\u2019s\nfamily\u2019s choice; 100 hours of community service; and random urinalysis (Ex. A).\nApplicant spent 98 days in jail (Tr. 47) and his three-year probation term began on June\n4, 2008 (Ex. B).  For his community service, Applicant refurbished several public\nbenches in his local community. He spent about 330 man-hours on the project (Ex. A,\nTr. 47). Allowed to substitute a OUI program for the alcohol evaluation component of his\nprobation (Tr. 98), Applicant completed Phase I of the court-ordered substance abuse\nprogram on August 22, 2008.   He attended Phase II from September 8, 2008, to\n5\nNovember 3, 2008, and was referred to Phase III (Exs. A, B). On January 28, 2009,\nApplicant made a payment of $2,500 to the memorial fund set up in the victim\u2019s\nmemory, to satisfy the charitable contribution requirement of his probation. As of\nFebruary 9, 2009, Applicant was in compliance with his probation (Ex. A). He was\nscheduled to start the final phase (Phase III) of the OUI-related program on February\n21, 2009 (Tr. 69, 85). At no time had he discussed his prior Ritalin abuse during his\nsessions because he considered it \u201cirrelevant.\u201d (Tr. 87). All urinalysis testing had been\nnegative for substances tested (Ex. A). He calls in to his probation officer once a month\nand sees her every other month (Tr. 78).\nAs of August 2008, Applicant was drinking alcohol twice a week, fewer than four\ndrinks in an evening (Ex. A). As of February 2009, he had been taking his present\nprescription medications for about a month. He denied taking more than the prescribed\ndosages (Tr. 84).\nApplicant did not allow his legal difficulties to affect his work performance for the\ndefense contractor. Well-regarded because of his hard work and dedication, Applicant\ncontinued to respond positively to his workplace challenges of increasingly more difficult\nand visible assignments. In December 2007, he received an award from his employer in\nrecognition of his outstanding efforts. He received the highest rating for his performance\n(excels at job requirements) as a senior engineer from March 2007 to March 2008 (Ex.\nA), but resigned from his job because of his legal difficulties (Ex. A, Tr. 114). Before\nleaving, he worked over the weekend to put together a transition package that was \u201cso\ngood\u201d that his second-level supervisor showed his boss (Tr. 115-16). In about October\n\n8\n2008, Applicant was rehired by the defense contractor. He continued to have a positive\nimpact within his working group (Ex. A).\nApplicant\u2019s second-level supervisor (Tr. 117-18) and his direct supervisor (Tr.\n124-26) have some knowledge that Applicant abused Ritalin at work in 2004, although\nhis direct supervisor believes it happened only once (Tr. 125). A third coworker, the\ntechnical leader of the working group, was unaware until \u201cthe other day\u201d that Applicant\nhad abused a prescription medication at work (Tr. 140-42). None of these professional\ncolleagues has any concern about Applicant holding a security clearance (Ex. A, Tr.\n116, 124, 135).\nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the\nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security\nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.\nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a\nsecurity clearance, the administrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the\nadjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions,\nwhich are useful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified\ninformation.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \n\nUnder Connecticut\u2019s General Statutes, evading responsibility, negligent homicide, and operating\n6\nunder the influence of liquor are violations of the state\u2019s motor vehicle laws:\nSec. 14-224. Evasion of responsibility in operation of motor vehicles. . . b) Each person\noperating a motor vehicle who is knowingly involved in an accident which causes physical\ninjury, as defined in section 53a-3, to any other person or injury or damage to property shall\nat once stop and render such assistance as may be needed and shall give his name, address\nand operator's license number and registration number to the person injured or to the owner\nof the injured or damaged property, or to any officer or witness to the physical injury to person\nor injury or damage to property, and if such operator of the motor vehicle causing the physical\ninjury of any person or injury or damage to any property is unable to give his name, address\nand operator's license number and registration number to the person injured or the owner of\nthe property injured or damaged, or to any witness or officer, for any reason or cause, such\noperator shall immediately report such physical injury of any person or injury or damage to\n9\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline J\u2014Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 sets out the security concern about criminal conduct:\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness.  By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nApplicant has misdemeanor convictions on his record that raise security\nsignificant criminal conduct concerns under AG \u00b6 31(a), \u201ca single serious crime or\nmultiple lesser offenses.\u201d He pleaded guilty to evading responsibility after he sideswiped\na car and left the scene in about 1996. In February 2008, he pleaded guilty to OUI for\ndriving while drunk in September 2004. Under a plea deal accepted by the state, he\nalso pleaded guilty in February 2008 to negligent homicide, reckless endangerment in\nthe first degree, assault in the third degree, and interfering with a police officer for\ncausing a fatal motor vehicle accident in October 2004. Although the OUI and negligent\nhomicide charges were punished under the pertinent state\u2019s motor vehicle statutes,  he\n6\n\nproperty to a police officer, a constable, a state police officer or an inspector of motor vehicles\nor at the nearest police precinct or station, and shall state in such report the location and\ncircumstances of the accident causing the physical injury of any person or the injury or\ndamage to property and his name, address, operator's license number and registration\nnumber. . . g) Any person who violates the provisions of subsection (b) or (c) of this section\nshall be fined not less than seventy-five dollars nor more than six hundred dollars or be\nimprisoned not more than one year or be both fined and imprisoned, and for any subsequent\noffense shall be fined not less than one hundred dollars nor more than one thousand dollars\nor imprisoned not more than one year or be both fined and imprisoned.\nSec. 14-222a. Negligent homicide with a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.\n(a) Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, any person who, in consequence of\nthe negligent operation of a motor vehicle, causes the death of another person shall be fined\nnot more than one thousand dollars or imprisoned not more than six months or both. (b) Any\nperson who, in consequence of the negligent operation of a commercial motor vehicle,\ncauses the death of another person shall be fined not more than two thousand five hundred\ndollars or imprisoned not more than six months, or both.\nSec. 14-227a. Operation while under the influence of liquor or drug or while having an\nelevated blood alcohol content. (a) Operation while under the influence or while having\nan elevated blood alcohol content. No person shall operate a motor vehicle while under\nthe influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug or both. A person commits the offense of\noperating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or any drug or both\nif such person operates a motor vehicle (1) while under the influence of intoxicating liquor or\nany drug or both, or (2) while such person has an elevated blood alcohol content. For the\npurposes of this section, \"elevated blood alcohol content\" means a ratio of alcohol in the\nblood of such person that is eight-hundredths of one per cent or more of alcohol, by weight,\nand \"motor vehicle\" includes a snowmobile and all-terrain vehicle, as those terms are defined\nin section 14-379.\nAt the time of his plea, Applicant was asked by the court clerk whether he pleaded guilty or not guilty to the\ncharge of \u201ccriminally negligent homicide.\u201d (Ex. A). W hile Applicant responded, \u201cGuilty,\u201d criminal negligent\nhomicide is distinguishable under state law from the negligent homicide that he was sentenced on as part of\nthe plea bargain. (See Sec. 53a-58. Criminally negligent homicide: Class A misdemeanor. (a) A person\nis guilty of criminally negligent homicide when, with criminal negligence, he causes the death of another\nperson, except where the defendant caused such death by a motor vehicle). \nConnecticut\u2019s penal code provides in relevant part:\n7\nSec. 53a-63. Reckless endangerment in the first degree: Class A misdemeanor. (a) A\nperson is guilty of reckless endangerment in the first degree when, with extreme indifference\nto human life, he recklessly engages in conduct which creates a risk of serious physical injury\nto another person. (b) Reckless endangerment in the first degree is a class A misdemeanor.\nSec. 53a-61. Assault in the third degree: Class A misdemeanor. (a) A person is guilty of\nassault in the third degree when: (1) W ith intent to cause physical injury to another person,\nhe causes such injury to such person or to a third person; or (2) he recklessly causes serious\nphysical injury to another person; or (3) with criminal negligence, he causes physical injury\nto another person by means of a deadly weapon, a dangerous instrument or an electronic\ndefense weapon. (b) Assault in the third degree is a class A misdemeanor and any person\nfound guilty under subdivision (3) (a) of this section shall be sentenced to a term of\n10\nwas sentenced to jail terms for the offenses. Furthermore, the reckless endangerment,\nassault, and interference are Class A misdemeanors under the state\u2019s penal code.

(a) A person is guilty\nof interfering with an officer when such person obstructs, resists, hinders or endangers any\npeace officer, special policeman appointed under section 29-18b, Department of Motor\nVehicles inspector appointed under section 14-8 and certified pursuant to section 7-294d, or\nfirefighter in the performance of such peace officer's, special policeman's or firefighter's\nduties.(b) Interfering with an officer is a class A misdemeanor.\n11\npolice found marijuana in his vehicle, apparently while it was impounded following the\nOctober 2004 accident, and it led to a charge of illegal possession of marijuana filed in\nlate December 2005 or early January 2006. The charge was dismissed without a\nconviction on Applicant\u2019s completion of a pretrial drug program. The lack of a conviction\ndoes not preclude me from considering the conduct for its security implications (see AG\n\u00b6 31(c), \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person\nwas formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted\u201d). Applicant has not contested\nthat marijuana was found. While  AG \u00b6 31(c) applies to that offense, credible evidence\nof unknowing possession could mitigate the security concern (see AG \u00b6 32(d),\n\u201cevidence that the person did not commit the offense\u201d). AG \u00b6 31(d), \u201cindividual is\ncurrently on parole or probation,\u201d is clearly implicated, given Applicant is on probation\nuntil 2011 for the 2004 offenses.\nMitigating condition AG \u00b6 32(a), \u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal\nbehavior happened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely\nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment,\u201d is implicated in part. He was only 17 when he evaded responsibility for\nsideswiping another car. Yet, while over four years have now passed since his more\nrecent criminal conduct in 2004, judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness concerns\npersist because of the seriousness of the misconduct committed while he held a\nsecurity clearance. He blew a .185% BAC after his arrest for OUI. Concerning the\nOctober 2004 negligent homicide and other charges stemming from the accident, I\ncannot conclude as a matter of law that Applicant committed the felony offenses of\nwhich he was originally charged. At the same time, Applicant cannot reasonably argue\nthat he did not commit criminal conduct or that his conduct was minor in nature just\nbecause he has no felony convictions on his record. A prosecutor\u2019s decision to accept a\nplea agreement does not necessarily establish that an offense is minor (see ISCR 07-\n17559, App. Bd., Dec. 19, 2008).  He was sentenced to a total of four years in jail,\nalthough he was required to serve only 98 days, and is on probation until June 2011.\nHis present probationary status is not a per se bar to holding a security clearance, but\nApplicant bears a substantial burden to show he is fully rehabilitated where he has\ncompleted less than half of his probation term.\nUnder AG \u00b6 32(d), evidence of successful rehabilitation includes, but is not\nlimited to, \u201cthe passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\n\n12\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive\ncommunity involvement.\u201d His employment references (Ex. A, Tr. 113-36) and\nperformance evaluation for March 2007 to March 2008 (Ex. A) show his dedication to\nhis work for the defense contractor. As of February 2009, Applicant was in compliance\nwith the terms of his probation. He fulfilled his community service, exceeding the\nmandatory 100 hours. On January 28, 2009, he made the required charitable\ncontribution with a payment of $2,500 to the accident victim\u2019s memorial fund. He\ncompleted the first two phases of an OUI program with the third phase scheduled to\nstart on the Saturday after his security clearance hearing.\nYet, Applicant\u2019s ongoing minimization of his misconduct raises considerable\ndoubts about his reform. Concerning the OUI, Applicant told an OPM investigator on\nJune 1, 2007, that his BAC was either .12% or .10% and that video showed he passed\nthe field sobriety tests. The higher BAC reported by the police (.185%), which he did not\nchallenge in court, cannot easily be reconciled with his testimony that he consumed only\nthree beers (Tr. 62-63). Although this high BAC reading was brought to the attention of\nthe judge in his presence in court in February 2008, Applicant signed off on the OUI\nprogram\u2019s evaluation report of August 22, 2008, which listed his BAC at .13%. There is\nno indication that the information in the evaluation report came from sources other than\nApplicant, and it raises concerns about whether Applicant has been completely candid\nwith the government and the OUI program evaluator about his OUI. When asked why\nthe court ordered him to complete an alcohol program if, as the toxicology report\nshowed, he was not impaired by alcohol at the time of the accident, Applicant blamed a\n\u201crogue reporter\u201d who wrote false articles about him in the newspaper (Tr. 97). He also\nblamed the victim\u2019s family members, who \u201cwere pushing the judge that this was a DUI\ncase.\u201d The transcript of the sentencing proceedings indicates that the alcohol screening\nwas court-ordered as a result of the OUI and not the accident.\nAs for the accident itself, Applicant correctly indicates that he was not convicted\nof criminal negligent homicide. Instead he was convicted of negligent homicide with a\nmotor vehicle. He has not denied that he caused the tragic accident, and he apologized\nto the victim\u2019s family at his sentencing. Applicant is not without remorse for causing the\ndeath of another person (\u201cI tell you what, it\u2019s a life-altering experience going to jail for 98\ndays and having that burden on myself knowing that somebody lost their life because of\nan accident that was my fault. And that\u2019s huge.\u201d Tr. 107), although it is noted that it was\nhis attorney and not the prosecutor who told the judge in February 2008 that Applicant\nhas been \u201cextremely remorseful.\u201d On the other hand, Applicant has yet to provide\ncredible explanations for the interference charge and what led him to swerve off the\nroad. He remembers drifting off the road, seeing the vehicle, and trying to avoid it (Tr.\n92), but claims to have no recall of his conduct that immediately preceded the accident.\nConcerning the interference with police charge, Applicant testified:\nIt was based on the fact that my account of the accident didn\u2019t agree with\nthe investigating officers . . . Well, the fact of the matter is, is the State\nPolice chose to leave of lot of information out of the police report. What I\nthought happened was I thought I swerved on the opposite side of the car\n\n13\nand apparently I went on the other side of the car, which was ultimately\ndetermine [sic] to be correct. So that was why they charged me with\ninterfering with a police officer because my account didn\u2019t match what the\nultimate State findings concluded. (Tr. 91)\nBy pleading guilty to interference, Applicant admitted that he obstructed, resisted,\nhindered, or otherwise endangered the police. A charge of interference is not made out\nby an account made in good faith that later proves to be inaccurate.\nWith respect to the evading responsibility and reckless driving charges in 1996,\nApplicant signed a SF 86 in August 2003 on which he indicated that a moving violation\ncharge had been dismissed in court. His attorney told him to list the charges as \u201cMotor\nVehicle Violations\u201d (Ex. B), but there is no evidence that he was advised to indicate the\ndisposition as \u201cdropped in court.\u201d Applicant now claims that he was unaware until 2004\nthat the evading responsibility charge had not been dismissed. But his assertion of a\nmistaken good faith belief is difficult to accept where he averred falsely in June 2007\nthat he had \u201cunknowingly sideswiped another car\u201d when he was 17 (Ex. 2). He admitted\nat his security clearance hearing that he had known he had damaged the other car and\nfled the scene because he was scared.\nConcerning the possession of marijuana charge filed in late 2005 or early 2006\nafter the drug was found in his impounded car, Applicant has consistently denied\nknowing possession of the drug and the case was dismissed without a conviction after\nhe completed a pretrial drug program. He told the OPM investigator in June 2007 that\nhe had bought his car used from a dealer in 2001 (Ex. 2). The police report from the\nOUI of September 2004 shows Applicant was driving a 1996 sedan. He apparently was\ndriving the same vehicle in October 2004. The government presented no evidence to\ncounter Applicant\u2019s claim that the marijuana was in a vial located behind the stereo. It is\npossible that the marijuana was placed there by a previous owner, or someone else,\nbefore Applicant purchased the car. In the absence of any evidence that Applicant ever\nused marijuana, I accept his assertion that he did not have knowing possession of\nmarijuana.\nDrug Involvement\nThe security concerns raised by illegal drug involvement are set out in AG \u00b6 24:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may\nimpair judgment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability\nor willingness t comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and\ninclude:\n\n14\n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed\nin the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or\ncannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and\n(2) inhalants and other similar substances;\n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a\nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction.\nApplicant abused his prescription for the stimulant Ritalin in 2004, snorting the\ncontents of capsules at home and at work to get a \u201crush.\u201d He snorted the drug in a\nlavatory at work on at least four occasions over the course of a week in July 2004 until\nhis supervisor reported him for suspected illegal drug abuse. The day he was\nconfronted by security, Applicant had taken three capsules (one more than the\nprescribed dose) with him from home, consumed two in the car while driving to work,\nand saved one to break apart and snort the contents at work. He was approached by\nsecurity before he could do so. The vial produced at the request of the company\ninvestigator was missing 24 pills, which would tend to indicate that Applicant had\nabused his prescription, not only by using it in a manner not prescribed, but also by\ntaking more than the prescribed daily dosage as he had intended on July 15, 2004, but\nfor the fact that he was confronted. AG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany drug abuse,\u201d is implicated. While\nApplicant had legal possession of the Ritalin, a Schedule II controlled substance with a\nhigh potential for abuse, the manner in which he used it deviated from approved\nmedical direction. Although Applicant exhibited extremely poor judgment in abusing his\nRitalin prescription while he held a security clearance, AG \u00b6 25(g), \u201cany illegal drug use\nafter being granted a security clearance,\u201d does not apply. Under AG \u00b6 24(b), illegal use\nof a drug (which would encompass those drugs with no medical purpose and/or those\nnot prescribed) is distinguishable from use of a legal drug in a manner deviating from\nmedical direction, and AG \u00b6 25(g) refers only to illegal drug use. Since he did not know\nthat there was marijuana in his vehicle, Applicant did not have illegal possession that\nwould implicate AG \u00b6 25(c), \u201cillegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing,\nmanufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia.\u201d  But\nAG \u00b6 25(c) still applies to the extent that he used paper, paper currency, and a credit\ncard to crush the granular Ritalin into a powder that he could then inhale. For purposes\nof facilitating his drug abuse, they became drug paraphernalia.\nAlthough Applicant continues to take prescription medications, primarily now for\nhis chronic insomnia, It has been almost five years since any evidence of drug abuse.\nAG \u00b6 26(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened under\nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d applies in that his abuse was\nlimited to the 2004 time frame. Applicant denies any abuse of Ritalin or any other\nprescribed drug since 2004 and has no intent to abuse any drug in the future. AG \u00b6\n26(b)(3), \u201ca demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the future, such as: (3) an\nappropriate period of abstinence,\u201d also applies. Concerns about his overall judgment\nand reliability persist (see the whole-person discussion, infra), in part because he stated\n\n15\nin his affidavit to the OPM investigator, \u201cI had abused Ritalin in the same manner once\nor twice (exact dates and frequency not recalled) before [the July 2004] incident and\nnever before at work.\u201d (Ex.2). He had admitted to the company investigator that he had\nbeen snorting his Ritalin on company property on three or four occasions in the same\nlavatory at work before the occasion that led to the investigation (Ex. 6). But a finding of\ndrug abuse requires some evidence of drug abuse and there is no indication that he\nabused Ritalin or any other prescribed medication since July 2004.\nAG \u00b6 26(c), \u201cabuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness\nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended,\u201d is not squarely\non point. While the Ritalin was prescribed and abused when Applicant was suffering\nfrom severe depression, which he indicates has been resolved, Applicant abused the\nRitalin at least in part for the rush and to be able to work when he was sleeping only two\nor three hours a night. He continues to suffer from chronic insomnia. Moreover, his is\nnot a case of physiological abuse that gradually developed because of the substance\u2019s\naddictive propensity, which is at the heart of AG \u00b6 26(c).\nApplicant completed EAP counseling in September 2004 as mandated by his\nemployer after he was caught abusing Ritalin at work (Ex. C). More recently, he fulfilled\nthe pretrial drug program, which consisted of eight, ninety minute group interaction\nsessions, in March 2007. While both the EAP and pretrial drug program sessions may\nproperly be considered in assessing the risk of recurrence, the record evidence does\nnot show that either program qualifies as a prescribed drug treatment program under\nAG \u00b6 26(d), \u201csatisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including\nbut not limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without recurrence of abuse,\nand a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional.\u201d Applicant testified\nthe pretrial drug program involved drug education (Tr. 89). Furthermore, there is no\nfavorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional, which is required under AG\n\u00b6 26(d).\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\n16\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. I have incorporated my comments\nunder Guideline J and Guideline H in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in\nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional\ncomment.\nApplicant\u2019s abuse of his Ritalin prescription, including on four or five occasions at\nwork in July 2004, raises serious judgment concerns that are mitigated, however,  by his\ncompletion of drug education programs with no recurrence. But the burden of\ndemonstrating reform of his criminal conduct is met only in part by his compliance with\nthe terms of his probation. The state has yet to consider him fully rehabilitated in that he\nis still on probation until June 2011.  While his probationary status does not bar him\nfrom holding a security clearance, he shows insufficient reform by inappropriately\nattributing blame and motivation to others (e.g., the interference charge stems from a\nvariation in his account with the police investigation and the police omitted information\nfrom their report; a rogue reporter published slanderous newspaper articles about him)\nand by dismissing or even concealing record evidence that places him in a less\nfavorable light. Undisputably, he is held in high regard by his work colleagues because\nof the quality of his performance. But he also showed little regard for his obligations as a\ncleared employee in abusing his prescribed Ritalin at work and in driving drunk outside\nof work. Based on all the information presented, I am unable to conclude that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue his access to classified\ninformation.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline H:\nFOR  APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\n\n17\nConclusion\nIn light of the record in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nELIZABETH M. MATCHINSKI\nAdministrative Judge\n",

She denied the factual allegations in \u00b6 1.f. of the SOR. She also provided additional information to support her request for eligibility for a security clearance. Guideline F - Financial Considerations The Applicant is estranged from her husband, and is now pending a divorce (TR at page 53 line 15 to page 56 line 14, and at page 61 line 24 to page 62 line 21). He assaulted her, locked her out of their house, and refused to pay her child support for their three children (Id). Only recently has he begun to pay $180 each month in child support (TR at page 43 lines 22~24, 57 lines 9~10, and 58 lines 13~16). This has caused the Applicant financial difficulties. 1.a.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nNovember 30, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCEFOLA, Richard A., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on October 17, 2007.  On April 23, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns\nunder Guideline F for Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 30, 2009.  She answered\nthe SOR in writing on May 20, 2009, and requested a hearing before an Administrative\nJudge.  DOHA received the request on July 28, 2009, and I received the case\nassignment the same day.  DOHA issued a notice of hearing the next day, on July 29,\n2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on August 19, 2009.  The Government\noffered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 7, which were received without objection.  Applicant\n\n2\ntestified on her own behalf, as did three witnesses, and she submitted Exhibits (AppXs)\nA through J, without objection.  DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (TR) on\nAugust 26, 2009.  I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until September\n2, 2009, to submit additional matters.  On September 2, 2009, she submitted Exhibit K,\nwithout objection. The record closed on September 2, 2009.  Based upon a review of\nthe case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a,\nthrough 1.e, and 1.g. through 1.i. of the SOR, with explanations.  She denied the factual\nallegations in \u00b6 1.f. of the SOR.  She also provided additional information to support her\nrequest for eligibility for a security clearance.\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nThe Applicant is estranged from her husband, and is now pending a divorce (TR\nat page 53 line 15 to page 56 line 14, and at page 61 line 24 to page 62 line 21).  He\nassaulted her, locked her out of their house, and refused to pay her child support for\ntheir three children (Id).  Only recently has he begun to pay $180 each month in child\nsupport (TR at page 43 lines 22~24, 57 lines 9~10, and 58 lines 13~16).  This has\ncaused the Applicant financial difficulties.\n1.a.  The first debt is a credit card debt, for the purchase of a motor vehicle, in\nthe amount of about $17,634 (GX 6 at page 1).  The Applicant is making monthly\npayments of $100 towards this debt, for the motor vehicle, which her estranged spouse\nhas kept (TR at page 21 lines 10~18, and at page 36 line 11 to page 38 line 11).  This is\nevidenced by Applicant\u2019s banking records (AppX A).\n1.b.  The second debt is a medical bill in the amount of about $6,926 (GX 4 at\npage 3).  Initially, Applicant\u2019s estranged spouse agreed to pay this bill, but has gone\nback on their verbal agreement (TR at page 38 line 12 to page 41 line 5).  As a result,\nthe Applicant has written the creditor, trying to set up a payment plan (AppX K Encl 4).\nThis is evidenced by correspondence to this creditor (Id).\n1.c.  The third debt is a credit card debt in the amount of about $1,001 (GX 4 at\npage 2).  The Applicant has written to this creditor, repeatedly, in an effort to satisfy this\ndebt (TR at page 23 lines 4~17, at page 42 line 24 to page 44 line 21, AppX B, and\nAppX K Encl 5).  She has received no response (TR at page 42 line 24 to page 44 line\n21).\n1.d.  The fourth debt is a bill for a cable box in the amount of about $66 (GX 2 at\npage 7).  The Applicant had to hire a locksmith to get into their home, as her estranged\nspouse locked her out (TR at page 24 line 22 to page 25 line 6, and at page 44 line 23\n\n3\nto page 46 line 13).  She then retrieve and return the cable box (Id).  She has now paid\nthe additional charges on this debt, as evidenced by her banking statement (AppX C).\n1.e.  The fifth debt is a medical bill for her broken clavicle, a result of an assault\nby her estranged spouse, in the amount of about $521 (GX 4 at page 1).  The Applicant\nis making periodic payments, ranging from monthly to bi-monthly, towards this debt\nsince May of 2009, as evidenced by her banking records (AppX D).\n1.f.  The sixth debt is a medical bill, for medication, related to the broken clavicle\nincident, in the amount of about $54 (TR at page 26 line 24 to page 27 line 10, and at\npage 48 line 5 to page 49 line 1, and GX 2 at page 17).  The Applicant has paid this\ndebt, as evidenced by a letter from the creditor (TR at page 26 line 24 to page 27 line\n10, and at page 48 line 5 to page 49 line 1, and AppX E).\n1.g.  The seventh debt is the result of a judgement in the amount of about $256\n(GX 4 at page 1).  This debt is the result of a disputed car payment, which the Applicant\nhas satisfied by way of garnishment (TR at page 28 lines 2~20, and at page 49 line 2 to\npage 50 line 21).  This is evidenced by the Applicant\u2019s pay documents (AppX F, and\nAppX K at Encl 2).\n1.h.  The eight debt is a cellular phone bill in the amount of about $542 (GX 4 at\npage 1).  Initially, Applicant\u2019s estranged spouse agreed to pay this bill, as it was his half\nof their bill for two cell phones; but again, he has gone back on this verbal commitment\n(TR at page 29 line 12 to page 30 line 4 line 5, and at page 51 line 10 to page 52 line\n12).  As a result, the Applicant has \u201csettled\u201d this debt, to the satisfaction of the creditor\n(AppX G).  This is evidenced by correspondence to this creditor (Id).\n1.i.  The last debt is for a home equity loan in the amount of about $24,428 (GX 6\nat page 3).  As the Applicant\u2019s estranged spouse still lives in their house, he will assume\nresponsibility for this debt (TR at page 30 line 22 to page 31 line 19, and at page 52 line\n13 to page 53 line 4).  This is evidenced by their divorce paperwork, specifically the\ndivision of their property and the assumption by each party of their debts (AppX H).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision.  According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\n\n4\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d  The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.  AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in Paragraph 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.  An individual who is financially\n\n5\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under\nSubparagraph 19(a), an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially\ndisqualifying.  Similarly under Subparagraph 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations@ may raise security concerns.  During her period of estrangement from her\nspouse, the Applicant accumulated many of her delinquent debts.\nThese are clearly countered by the Mitigating Conditions found in Subparagraphs\n20(b) and 20 (d).  Under Subparagraph 20(b), it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., . . .\ndivorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@\nFurthermore, Subparagraph 20(d) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual\ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Here,\nthe Applicant, with little help from her estranged spouse, has addressed all of the\nalleged past due debt.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.\u201d  Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of\nwhether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person\nconcept.  Here, she has the unqualified support of her colleagues (TR at page 66 line\n15 to page 79 line 12, and AppX I).\nThe Administrative Judge should also consider the nine adjudicative process\nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nI considered all of the evidence, including the potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions surrounding this case.  Overall, the record evidence leaves me\nwithout questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance.  For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns\narising from her financial considerations.\n\n6\n\n7\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.I:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all of the factual allegations in the SOR. I included Applicant's admission in my findings of fact. After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, and exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact. Applicant is 31 years old and has worked as a materials handler for a defense contractor for approximately two years. He received a bachelor's degree in December 2002. He is married with three children. Applicant's monthly pay is approximately $2,800. His wife is employed and contributes $1,400 monthly to the family income for a total monthly income of $4,200. Their monthly expenses are approximately $3,800, leaving $400 in monthly discretionary funds (Tr. 72-75; Gov. Ex. 1, e-QIP, dated April 23, 2008). Credit reports (Gov. Ex. 5, Credit report, dated May 2, 2008; Gov. Ex. 6, Credit report, dated September 11, 2008; Gov. Ex. 7, Credit report, dated January 12, 2009; and Gov.

Blank, Jr., Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Lachaun Peake, Personal Representative \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) as part of his employment with a defense contractor on April 23, 2008. After an \ninvestigation conducted by the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), dated \nJune 22, 2009, to Applicant detailing security concerns for financial considerations \nunder Guideline F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. Applicant \nacknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 27, 2009. \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 15, 2009, admitting the 19 \nallegations under Guideline F with a detailed explanation and exhibits. He requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed \non October 1, 2009, and the case was assigned to me on October 7, 2009. DOHA \n \n1 \n \n \nJanuary 29, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nissued a Notice of Hearing on October 7, 2009, scheduling a hearing for October 22, \n2009. I convened the hearing as scheduled. The government offered eight exhibits, \nmarked Government Exhibits (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 8, which were admitted without \nobjection. Applicant and one witness testified on his behalf. While Applicant did not offer \nany exhibits, he referred during the hearing to exhibits that were included with his \nresponse to the SOR. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on November 6, \n2009. I kept the record open for Applicant to file documents. Applicant timely filed three \ndocuments marked Applicant exhibits A through C, which were received without \nobjection. Based on a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \neligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nApplicant received the Notice of Hearing on October 14, 2009. Applicant is \nentitled to 15 days advance notice of the hearing (Directive E3.1.8). Applicant discussed \nwith Department Counsel the hearing date of October 20, 2009, before the Notice of \nHearing was issued on October 7, 2009. Since Applicant discussed the hearing date \nwith Department counsel before the Notice of Hearing was issued, actual notice was \ngiven more than 15 days before the hearing. However, Applicant signed for the Notice \nof Hearing only eight days prior to the hearing. At the hearing, Applicant waived the 15 \ndays notice requirement (Tr. 4-10). \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the factual allegations in the SOR. I included Applicant's \nadmission in my findings of fact. After a thorough review of the pleadings, transcript, \nand exhibits, I make the following essential findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is 31 years old and has worked as a materials handler for a defense \ncontractor for approximately two years. He received a bachelor's degree in December \n2002. He is married with three children. Applicant's monthly pay is approximately \n$2,800. His wife is employed and contributes $1,400 monthly to the family income for a \ntotal monthly income of $4,200. Their monthly expenses are approximately $3,800, \nleaving $400 in monthly discretionary funds (Tr. 72-75; Gov. Ex. 1, e-QIP, dated April \n23, 2008). \n \nCredit reports (Gov. Ex. 5, Credit report, dated May 2, 2008; Gov. Ex. 6, Credit \nreport, dated September 11, 2008; Gov. Ex. 7, Credit report, dated January 12, 2009; \nand Gov. Ex. 8, Credit report, dated April 21, 2009) show the following delinquent debts \nfor Applicant: a medical debt for $447 (SOR 1.a); another medical debt for $47 (SOR \n1.b); a debt in collection for $88 (SOR 1.c); a medical debt for $4,825 (SOR 1.d); a \ncredit card debt for $391 (SOR 1.e); a debt for telephone service for $657 (SOR 1.f); a \ndebt for furniture for $3,013 (SOR 1.g); a debt for $6,328 (SOR 1.h); a debt in collection \nfor telephone service for $116 (SOR 1.i); a debt in collection for a credit card for $575 \n(SOR 1.j); a student loan account for $36,694 (SOR 1.k); another student loan account \nfor $3,406 (SOR 1.l); a medical account in collection for $28 (SOR 1.m); another \n\n \n3 \n \n \nmedical account in collection for $278 (SOR 1.n); a loan account in collection for $350 \n(SOR 1.o); a medical account in collection for $270 (SOR 1.p); and an account on a \ncredit card in collection for $175 (SOR 1.q). There are also reports of Applicant uttering \ntwo fraudulent checks (SOR 1.r, and SOR 1.s; Gov. Ex. 4, Criminal justice report). \n \nThe delinquent debts at SOR 1.a and 1.b are medical debts for the same \ncreditor. Applicant incurred the bills when he was a college student. He was initially \nincluded on his father's health insurance plan, but lost coverage when he was not taking \nsufficient credit hours. He became ill and had to go to the emergency room. He \ncontacted the creditor and was told to pay as much as he could whenever he could \nmake a payment. He is making some payments on the debt at SOR 1.a, and the \nbalance is now $229. The debt at SOR 1.b is paid in full (Tr. 35-36; Response to the \nSOR, Exhibit B, Money order, dated July 15, 2009; App. Ex. C, Payment receipt, \nundated).   \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.c is paid in full (Tr. 36-37; Response to SOR, \nExhibit C, Money order, dated July 15, 2009). The delinquent debts at SOR 1.d and 1.p \nare for medical expenses Applicant incurred when he was a student and not included on \nhis father's health insurance plan. Applicant has a payment plan with the creditor and \nthey deduct payment of $50 each month from his bank account. Applicant is not sure of \nthe balanced owed on either debt because the creditor does not provide such \ninformation (Tr. 26-27, 37-39; App. Ex. B, Bank statement, dated January 25, 2010).  \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.e was settled for $102 and paid in full (Tr. 39, 48-\n53; Response to SOR, Exhibit E, Letter, dated July 6, 2009). The delinquent debt at \nSOR 1.f for telephone service has been paid (Tr. 27-28, 39; App. Ex. C, Paid letter, \ndated May 2, 2009).  \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.g is for furniture Applicant's wife purchased before \nthey were married. After they were married, Applicant's name was added to the \naccount. Applicant's wife lost her job and she continued to not work because of a \npregnancy and having a young child at home. They were unable to make payments on \nthe furniture and it was repossessed. Applicant makes small payments on this debt \nwhen he has funds, and the debt has been reduced (Tr. 53-55; Response to SOR, \nExhibit G, Receipt, dated July 1, 2009).   \n \nApplicant and his wife are not aware of the delinquent debt at SOR 1.h. The debt \nis being reported by only one of the three credit reporting agencies. Applicant attempted \nto contact the company but to no avail. He protested the debt to the one credit reporting \nagency and it has been removed from their credit report as not verified (Tr. 24-25; \nResponse to SOR, Exhibit H, Letter, dated July 8, 2009).  \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.i is for telephone service and is paid in full in \nDecember 2008 (Tr. 28; Response to SOR, Exhibit I, Letter with receipts, dated June \n30, 2009). The delinquent debt at SOR 1.j is to a bank on a loan. Applicant makes $20 \nmonthly payments on the debt (Tr. 40). \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.k is for student loans. The loans are now in \ndeferment and considered current (Tr. 40). The delinquent debt at SOR 1.l is also for \nstudent loans. The loans were consolidated with other student loans and are in \ndeferment. However, Applicant has made some payments on the loans (Tr. 41-42; \nResponse to SOR, Exhibit L, Money Order, dated July 15, 2009).  \n \nThe delinquent debt at SOR 1.m is paid in full (Tr. 42-43; Response to SOR, \nExhibit M, Money Order, dated July 15, 2009). The delinquent debt at SOR 1.n was \nsettled for $55 and paid in full (Tr. 42-43, Response to SOR, Exhibit N, Money Order, \ndated July 15. 2009). \n \nApplicant and his wife called the creditor for the delinquent debt at SOR 1.o, but \ndid not receive an answer. They have sent small amounts in payment of the debt. They \nare not sure the money orders are being cashed (Tr. 43; Response to SOR, Exhibit O, \nMoney Orders, dated July 15, 2009). The delinquent debt at SOR 1.q was settled and \npaid in full (Tr. 44; Response to SOR, Exhibit Q, Letter dated July 7, 2009). \n \nThe SOR allegations at 1.r and 1.s pertain to checks returned for insufficient \nfunds by the bank. Applicant did not initially know of the dishonored checks. When he \nwas advised of the returned checks, he redeemed them and the charges were \ndismissed (Tr. 45-46; Response to SOR, Exhibits R and S, Case Disposition, dated \nApril 14, 2000). \n \nApplicant's pastor testified that she has known Applicant for a few years and \nsees him regularly. She considers him honest, reliable, and trustworthy. He is always \nwilling to do whatever she asks him to do. She knows he has financial problems \nbecause of his youth and immaturity. But she also knows that he is trying to resolve his \nfinancial problems to the best of his ability (Tr. 79-82). \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered \nin evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Considerations: \n \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by \nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is \nfinancially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds \n(AG \u00b6 18). Similarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to protect classified \ninformation. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life provides an \nindication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage his finances in such a way as to meet his financial \nobligations.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \nThe delinquent debts listed in credit reports for Applicant are a security concern \nraising Financial Consideration Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \u00b6 AG 19(a) (inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts), and FC DC AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial \nobligations). Applicant incurred delinquent debt as a college student for medical \nexpense, student loans, and living expenses. Applicant assumed his wife's delinquent \ndebts when they married.    \n \n \nI considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) AG \u00b6 20(a) \n(the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment), and FC MC AG \u00b6 20(b) (the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problems were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances). These mitigating conditions partially apply. Applicant's \nfinancial problems started as a college student without health insurance. He required \nstudent loans to finance his education. His wife also brought some delinquent debts to \nthe marriage. Some of the debts have been paid, but most of the debts are still \noutstanding and so are current debts. There were no unusual circumstances beyond \nApplicant's control that led to the debts. The debts were incurred in the normal course of \nfinancial activities. However, Applicant is paying his delinquent debts and is acting \nresponsibly toward his debts.  \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts). For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, \nthere must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d of a \ngood-faith effort to repay. A systematic method of handling debts is needed. Applicant \nmust establish a \"meaningful track record\" of debt payment. A \"meaningful track record\" \nof debt payment can be established by evidence of actual debt payments or reduction of \ndebt through payment of debts. An applicant is not required to establish that he paid \neach and every debt listed. The entirety of an Applicant\u2019s financial situation and his \nactions can reasonably be considered in evaluating the extent to which that Applicant\u2019s \nplan for the reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. \nAvailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, should be considered in reaching a determination. There is no requirement \nthat a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a \nreasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of such debts \none at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in \nfurtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. All that is required \nis that Applicant demonstrates he has established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.   \n \nApplicant has paid 8 of his 17 delinquent debts. He is paying another six debts \naccording to agreed plans. In addition, his largest single debt, his student loans, are \nconsidered current since the loans are in deferment. He disputed one debt and it has \nbeen removed from his credit report as not verified. Applicant's actions paying and \n\n \n7 \n \n \nresolving his delinquent debts is significant and credible information to establish a \nmeaning track record of debt payment, and shows that he acted reasonably under the \ncircumstances.  \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the \nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provided \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of action \nto resolve he issue). Applicant disputed one debt that he had no knowledge of and was \nonly reported by one of the credit reporting agencies. The debt was not verified and was \nremoved from his credit report.  \n \nApplicant has acted responsibly towards his debts and finances under the \ncircumstances. Applicant presented sufficient information to mitigate security concerns \nfor financial considerations by establishing that he has or is paying his delinquent debts. \nHis finances do not indicate a security concern.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for access to \nclassified information must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered that Applicant has a \nreputation in the community for reliability, honesty, and trustworthiness.  \n \n \nApplicant established a meaningful track record of debt payment of his \ndelinquent debts. He has or is paying all of his debts except for student loans, which are \nin deferment. He established that he acted reasonably and responsibly towards his \nfinances indicating he will act reasonably and responsibly to protect classified \ninformation. The management of his finances indicates he will be concerned, \nresponsible, and not careless concerning classified information. Overall, the record \n\n \n8 \n \n \nevidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for access to classified information. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial situation. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.s:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to \nclassified information. Clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nTHOMAS M. CREAN \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense contractor.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Randi B. Walker, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant committed a series of domestic violence offenses between 1994 and\n2007, and Negligent Driving with a blood alcohol level over the legal limit in 2002. He\nremains on probation for his most recent domestic violence conviction. Security\nconcerns were insufficiently mitigated. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaires for Investigation Processing\n(e-QIP), on May 25, 2008. On April 1, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security\nconcerns under Guideline J. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nSeptember 14, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 13, 2009. He answered the\nSOR in writing on April 17, 2009, and requested a hearing before an administrative\njudge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on May 27, 2009, and the case\nwas assigned to a different administrative judge on the following day. DOHA reassigned\nthe case to me on June 8, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on June 11, 2009,\nand I convened the hearing as scheduled on June 22, 2009. Applicant and his counsel\nwaived the right to 15-days notice on the record (Tr. at 7-8), and said they had adequate\ntime to prepare for the hearing. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 4,\nwhich were admitted without objection. Applicant offered exhibits (AE) A through Y,\nwhich were also admitted without objection, and testified on his own behalf. Four other\nwitnesses also testified for him. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to leave the record open\nuntil June 29, 2009, to permit him to submit additional evidence. On that date, Applicant\nsubmitted the additional evidence to Department Counsel, who forwarded it the\nfollowing day without objection to its consideration. This evidence was admitted, marked\nAE Z, and the record was closed. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on\nJune 30, 2009. \nFindings of Fact\nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant denied all of the factual allegations\nconcerning his criminal conduct. Applicant is a 46-year-old employee of a defense\ncontractor. He has worked for his present employer since January 1990, except for two\nyears in the mid-1990s when he attended community college and obtained an\nassociate\u2019s degree while laid off. He served in the military, with a security clearance,\nfrom 1984 until December 1989, when he was honorably discharged for medical\nreasons. He is twice divorced with no children. (GE 1 at 7, 11-20, 26-27; AE P at 2; AE\nX; Tr. at 91-93.)\nIn May 1994, Applicant was involved in an argument with his second wife that\nresulted in their neighbors calling the police to report that they saw him hit or shove her.\nApplicant told different versions of events during the hearing and during his July 16,\n2008 interview with an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator. During the\nhearing, he said he left the house and went for a drive to defuse the argument, and his\nwife explained to the police that her face was reddened due to some medication she\nwas taking, not because he hit her. He told the OPM investigator that while his wife was\nstanding in the open doorway to their back patio during a particularly insulting part of the\nargument, he raised his hand as if to hit her and said, \u201cyou deserve to be smacked for\nthat comment.\u201d He said that she realized how mad she had made him and moved back,\ncatching her heel on the door jamb. She lost her balance and stumbled out the door\nbackwards, he said. Applicant was arrested and charged with Assault 4  Degree. He\nth\ncontested the charge at trial, and was found not guilty after the neighbors admitted they\nhad not actually seen Applicant assault his wife because a fence obstructed their view,\nand his wife testified that he had not actually touched her. (GE 3 at 8; Tr. at 120-123.)\nIn November 1995, Applicant was involved in a minor traffic accident when he\ntried to merge into the right lane when a two-lane road was narrowed to one lane by\n\n3\ntraffic-control barrels. The person to his right was forced partially off the road, and side-\nswiped his car forcing Applicant to hit several of the barrels. The other driver pulled\nover, but Applicant kept going to avoid a confrontation. He later stopped and called the\npolice, who told him to return to the scene. Responding police took statements from\nboth drivers and two witnesses who stopped to help. Applicant received a reckless\ndriving ticket in the mail. He brought the witnesses to court to testify that the accident\nwas not his fault, and the charge was dropped. (Tr. at 100, 123-125.) \nApplicant and his second wife separated in 1998 and divorced in December\n2000. In 2001, he began dating and living with a woman and her two children in the\nhome he had purchased in 1990 and retained after the divorce. She was an alcoholic\nand they argued frequently. She could not hold a job, and depended on him for most\nliving expenses. In 2003, she inherited some money from her father and temporarily\nmoved out on her own while attending school. Sometime in 2004, she moved back and\nremained there until late 2007, when he convinced her to leave again. All of Applicant\u2019s\nsubsequent criminal conduct involved incidents with this woman. (GE 3 at 4-8; Tr. at\n114, 132-138, 154-156, 167-171.)\nDuring the early morning hours of June 16, 2002, Applicant\u2019s girlfriend and a\nneighbor with whom she had gone out drinking called him for a ride home. He had gone\nto bed earlier because he had to get up at 4:00 a.m. for work. When he arrived at the\nbar, they were not ready to leave. He wound up drinking two premium beers over the\nnext 45 to 60 minutes, after which they left at closing time. They stopped at a grocery\nstore on the way home to buy breakfast items and more beer. After leaving the store,\nApplicant failed to use his turn signal while accelerating to merge ahead of a vehicle\nalready on the interstate. A state patrol trooper pulled him over and asked if he had\nbeen drinking. He said \u201cno.\u201d He then failed a field sobriety test, for reasons he continues\nto blame on the trooper rather than his level of intoxication. He was arrested and taken\nto the station, where his blood alcohol content was tested twice at .091 (or .094) and\n.076 (or .074). The legal limit is .08, so he was charged with Driving Under the Influence\n(DUI) and Negligent Driving 1  Degree. Under a plea agreement, the DUI charge was\nst\namended to Negligent Driving 1  Degree, to which Applicant pled guilty. He was\nst\nsentenced to 90 days in jail (89 days suspended), a fine of $1,000 ($235 suspended),\nand $150 in other costs. He was also ordered to attend a DUI victim\u2019s panel, alcohol\ninformation school, and to serve two years of monitored unsupervised probation. He\nunderwent a chemical dependency assessment that found \u201cinsufficient evidence to\nsupport a diagnosis of substance abuse or dependence.\u201d He received a new moving\nviolation on April 1, 2003, resulting in the imposition of the suspended $235 fine for\nviolating terms of probation. (AE N; AE P; GE3 at 7-8; Tr. at 101-102, 126-132.)\nDuring August 2004, Applicant and his girlfriend attended a baseball game with\ntwo other friends. They both drank beer at the game. On the way out of the stadium, the\ngirlfriend became temporarily separated from the others, panicked, and became very\nupset with Applicant. She continued drinking after they got home, and they eventually\nargued again. Applicant\u2019s descriptions of this incident and the later domestic assault\ncharge were somewhat confused during the hearing. He claimed during his OPM\n\n4\ninterview that she slapped him once and tried to do so again, at which point he\nphysically restrained her. When she would not calm down, he tried to leave. She\njumped on his back and wrapped her arms and legs around his neck and waist. After\nunsuccessfully telling her to stop choking him, he went back into the living room, bent\nover, and dumped her on her head on the floor. She left the house and he locked her\nout and went to bed. He refused to talk to the police when they called on the telephone,\nand later knocked on the door and asked to speak with him. After he went back to bed,\nthe police had to kick in the front door and arrested him because his girlfriend had\nvisible bruising and he had no visible injury. He spent two nights in jail before a friend\nbailed him out. He was issued a no-contact order that remained in effect until his\ngirlfriend petitioned the court to have it lifted and to have the charges dismissed;\nrequests which the court granted. (GE 3 at 6-7; Tr. at 102-103, 142-149.)   \nDuring mid-December 2006, Applicant and his girlfriend went to the bar where\nshe was working to get her paycheck around noon. It was not ready, so they stayed and\nbegan to drink. Applicant had lunch and watched several football games. Her check\narrived around 3:00 p.m., but they remained at the bar. Applicant continued drinking \u201ca\ncouple beers while watching the game. Maybe more than a couple, I really don\u2019t know.\u201d\n(Tr. at 140.) He stopped drinking around 8:00 p.m. and had dinner. At about 10:00 p.m.,\nhe went to the restaurant next door where his girlfriend had gone to get her to go home.\nShe was drunk, had a fresh beer, and refused to leave. Applicant gave her keys to the\nbartender and told him to be sure she took a cab home. He then went home and went to\nbed. Sometime after 2:00 a.m., his girlfriend burst into their bedroom and started yelling\nat him to give her money for the cab. After she paid the cab driver, she returned to the\nbedroom and continued yelling at him. He told her to be quiet or get her daughter and\npack up and move out. When he closed his eyes and tried to ignore her, she punched\nhim in the face and ran out of the room. He followed her out and told her again to leave.\nWhen she continued to confront him, he grabbed the hood of her jacket and pulled her\nout the front door. They continued struggling as he tried to close the door and she tried\nto come back into the house. At some point, she \u201cstumbled back, tripped off a step and\nfell down as he tried to close the door,\u201d although he claimed he did not push or shove\nher. He said he tried to help her up, but \u201cshe kept kicking and screaming so he let go of\nher jacket and she again fell back onto the porch/lawn.\u201d (GE 3 at 4.) He then locked her\nout and went to bed, as she continued to pound on the door. Eventually the door was\nbroken in by the police who arrested him and took him to jail where he remained for\nalmost three days before posting bail. He was charged with Assault-Domestic Violence\n4  Degree and Disorderly Conduct, and was issued another court order requiring him to\nth\nremain 500 feet away from, and have no contact with his girlfriend for one year. He\nmoved into a friend\u2019s house and she remained in his house. (GE 3 at 4-5; Tr. at 138-\n144.)\nApplicant received a telephone call from his neighbors in March 2007, telling him\nthat his girlfriend appeared to be out of town and had not been around the house for\nseveral days. He went to the house to see if she had moved out. His restraining order\ndid not forbid him to go to the house, to his understanding, unless she was present.\nWhen he arrived, the yard was badly untended, with foot-long grass and weeds choking\n\n5\nout the flower beds. He testified that he spent the weekend there, from Friday noon to\nSunday night cleaning up. While he was sleeping in his house, his girlfriend returned\nfrom a night of partying with friends around 2:00 or 3:00 a.m. and discovered him in the\nbedroom. She then left and called the police. She returned to tell him the police were\nthere. He ran outside to the back patio area and hid in the doghouse, where he was\narrested. He told the police his order permitted him to be there when she was absent,\nbut could not produce a copy of it, so he was charged with violating the no-contact order\nand removed. He again spent three days in jail before posting bail. This arrest occurred\non March 16, 2007, which was a Friday. (GE 2 at 2; GE 3 at 5-6; Tr. at 105, 150-153.) \nAfter a series of continuances, Applicant finally went to trial in November 2007\nand pled guilty to Disorderly Conduct for the December 2006 domestic violence charge.\nThe domestic violence court order violation charge was dismissed and the no-contact\norder was lifted. He was sentenced to 90 days in jail (all suspended), a $1,000 fine\n($650 suspended), and two years of probation that is due to expire on November 26,\n2009. (GE 2; GE 3 at 6; GE 4 at 2; Tr. at 103-104,154.) \nAlso in late November 2007, Applicant and his father began serious efforts to get\nhis girlfriend to move out of his house. Applicant agreed to give her the car he had\npurchased for her, and his father gave her $3,000. Her mother and step-father agreed\nthat she could live with them if Applicant would pay for six months of storage for her\nbelongings, which he did and she moved out. After six months, the storage company\nnotified Applicant that she would not pay them and they would confiscate her stored\nitems. He called her to warn her about that and she convinced him to store her items in\na spare bedroom in his house. Her parents eventually kicked her out and she lived out\nof her car, occasionally stopping by to ask Applicant for money. When it got very cold\nduring late 2008, he let her live in his tent camper under a carport for about a month.\nThen he locked the camper up and put it away one day when she was gone. In\nDecember 2008 or January 2009, he began dating another woman who he continues to\nsee full time. His former girlfriend continues to call him and leave messages, but he has\nrefused further contact with her recently. (GE 4 at 1; AE H; Tr. at 154-158.) He\ncontinues to have a close father-daughter-like relationship with her daughter, who is\nnow twelve years old. (AE H at 2; Tr. at 113, 134, 166.)  \nApplicant successfully completed eight-hour anger management skills classes on\nApril 7, 2007, and May 30, 2009. (AE O.) He submitted numerous letters of\nrecommendation from his friends and coworkers attesting to his good character,\nintegrity, and generosity. (AE B through H; AE Z.) Four of them testified to the same\neffect during the hearing. (Tr. at 33 to 89.) He has earned numerous performance\nawards and certificates of achievement for his work performance. (AE Q; AE R.) He\nalso performed significant community service involving youth activities, charitable fund\nraising, and the Special Olympics during the 1990s. (AE W; AE Y; Tr. at 114-115.) He\nwas also highly successful while attending community college. (AE S; AE T; AE U.) His\nperformance appraisals show him predominantly exceeding expectations from 2004\nthrough 2006, and meeting expectations during 2007 and 2008. (AE I through M.) He\n\n6\nexhibited little remorse about the various incidents of misconduct during his testimony,\nblaming police and others for his arrests.  \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According\nto AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable\nguidelines in the context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. I have avoided drawing inferences grounded\non mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. \nDecisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant\nmay deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such\ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential,\nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n\n7\nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying (DCs). The three DCs asserted by the Government were, \u201c(a)\na single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;\u201d \u201c(c) allegation or admission of\ncriminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally\nprosecuted, or convicted;\u201d and \u201c(d) the individual is currently on parole or probation.\u201d\n(Tr. at 175-176.) \nAs alleged in the SOR, Applicant was arrested on four separate occasions for\ndomestic-violence-related incidents involving two different women he lived with between\n1994 and 2007. All resulted from confrontations and arguments that Applicant admitted\ntook place. The other charges were ultimately dismissed, but the December 2006\nincident resulted in his conviction of Disorderly Conduct for which he remains on\nprobation until November 26, 2009. He was involved in 1995 in an apparent road-rage\ntraffic accident for which his citation for reckless driving was ultimately dismissed. He\nwas convicted of Negligent Driving 1  Degree after his June 2002 DUI arrest while\nst\ndriving home from a bar where he admitted he was drinking. The evidence fully\nsupports security concerns under the DCs set forth in AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a), (c), and (d). \nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns (MCs). These\nare: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those\npressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life;\n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement.\nFor mitigation analysis, Applicant\u2019s SOR-listed criminal conduct and criminal\nhistory must be evaluated as a whole. His pattern of multiple arrests after domestic\nconfrontations with women is indicative of poor judgment and a lack of self-control. His\n\n8\nDUI conviction and violation of a no-contact order by remaining in his house after his\ngirlfriend returned demonstrate a willingness to flaunt rules and regulations. Given the\nlengthy and repetitive nature of his criminal history, Applicant did not establish\npersuasive mitigation of the concerns arising therefrom. His domestic violence arrests\nafter physical arguments with multiple women over 12 years, for the most recent of\nwhich he remains on probation, preclude substantial mitigation under MC 32(a). He\nmade no showing that he was pressured or coerced into any of his criminal acts to\nsupport application of MC 32(b). \nAlthough he formally denied all the SOR allegations, he admitted during his OPM\ninterview and the hearing that he committed the crimes for which he was arrested as\nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b,, 1.c, 1.d, and 1.f. He violated the no-contact order by failing\nto leave when his girlfriend returned home and evidenced his consciousness of guilt by\nhiding from the responding police in the doghouse. He pled guilty to Disorderly Conduct,\nand was convicted thereof, for the fight with his girlfriend in December 2006. He\nadmitted fighting with her in August 2004 after the baseball game, and dumping her on\nher head on their livingroom floor. He pled guilty to Negligent Driving 1  Degree and\nst\nwas convicted after being arrested for DUI and testing over the legal blood alcohol limit.\nHe admitted angrily threatening to strike his wife in 1994, causing her to fall backward\nout their back door. This is an offer-type assault without regard to whether actual\nphysical contact occurred between their persons. The record evidence shows that the\n1995 reckless driving charge was dismissed after independent witnesses stated that the\naccident was not Applicant\u2019s fault, so MC 32(c) applies to mitigate only this offense\namong those listed on the SOR.   \nApplicant\u2019s good employment and education records, and his constructive\ncommunity involvement are evidence that support potential rehabilitation, although the\ncommunity involvement primarily occurred during his second marriage and predates\nmost of his offenses. The recency and repetitive nature of his criminal activity, however,\nleads to the conclusion that on balance it is still too soon to be confident that such\nbehavior is unlikely to recur, and no longer casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness,\nand judgment. His lack of remorse, evidenced by his attitude toward these offenses and\nexplanations blaming his victims and the police as the primary causes of his problems,\nfurther precludes a finding of substantial mitigation under MC 32(d).\n \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances established by the record evidence. The\nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\n\n9\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of security\nconcern involved multiple domestic violence offenses and a 2002 DUI. All occurred\nwhile he was in his 30s and 40s, fully mature and accountable for his actions. No single\nincident, in and of itself, was particularly serious, but together they demonstrate a\npattern reflecting poor judgment and inadequate self-control. He knowingly and\nvoluntarily participated in every incident of security concern, and failed to take\nnecessary steps to change the circumstances under which his problems recurred until\nvery recently. It has been only a few months since he purportedly broke off\ncommunications with his former girlfriend, he remains close with her daughter, and he\nstill stores her personal possessions in his home. While some evidence of rehabilitation\nwas presented, including anger management classes as recently as May 30, 2009, he\nremains on probation for his most recent conviction; hence, it is too soon to confidently\nconclude that continuation or recurrence of his criminal conduct is unlikely. His evident\nlack of remorse indicates insufficient insight into his responsibility for his misconduct\nand necessary behavioral changes. He has not yet established a track record to\ndemonstrate reduced potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress.\nOverall, the record evidence generates substantial doubts concerning Applicant\u2019s\npresent eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. He has not met his burden to\nmitigate the security concerns arising from his criminal conduct.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n10\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                             \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Based on the results of the background\n1\ninvestigation, including Applicant\u2019s response to the interrogatories, DOHA adjudicators\nNovember 17, 2009\n\n Required by Executive Order 10865, as amended, and by DoD Directive 5220.6 (Directive), as amended.\n2\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the revised adjudicative guidelines, approved by the President on\n3\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006.

DOHA received the transcript of hearing (Tr.) on September 8, 2009. \nFindings of Fact\nThe government alleged in the SOR that Applicant used marijuana or hashish\nwith varying frequency between September 2001 and September 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.a(1));\nbetween 1983 and 1988 (SOR \u00b6 1.a(2)); between 1976 and 1977 (SOR \u00b6 1.a(3)); and\nbetween 1967 and 1974 (SOR \u00b6 1.a(4)). It was also alleged that he sold marijuana in\n2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); that he used LSD about five times between October 1967 and\nAugust 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); that he used hallucinogenic mushrooms in June 2003 and\nAugust 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); that he used cocaine in 1972, 1975, 1977, and 1985 (SOR \u00b6\n1.e); that he used quaaludes in 1972 (SOR \u00b6 1.f); that he used amphetamines in 1968\nand 1970 (SOR \u00b6 1.g); that he was charged with possession of marijuana with intent to\nsell in 1968 (SOR \u00b6 1.h); that he used mescaline in about 1967 (SOR \u00b6 1.I); and that he\nused opium in 1967 (SOR \u00b6 1.j)\nThe government further alleged in the SOR that Applicant stated, during a\nDecember 13, 1977, subject interview with a DoD investigator, that if drug use would\njeopardize his suitability for access to classified information, he would cease all future\ndrug use (SOR \u00b6 2.a); and that, in August 1993, he told a DoD investigator that he last\nused marijuana in 1988 and that he would not use it again (SOR \u00b6 2.b). Applicant\nadmitted all of the SOR allegations without explanation or qualification. In addition to the\nfacts established by his admissions, I make the following findings of relevant fact.\nApplicant is 60 years old and is an engineer working for a defense contractor. His\narea of expertise and principal interest is in the design and installation of visual flight\nsimulators. He has worked for his current employer since July 2007. He has worked for\ndefense contractors in the past, but most recently worked for companies outside this\narena in jobs that did not require a security clearance. When Applicant submitted his\ncurrent SF-86, he disclosed an extensive history of involvement with and use of illegal\ndrugs beginning around 1967 and continuing until at least 2006. As alleged and\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n4\n3\nadmitted to in the SOR, the drug Applicant used, bought, sold, and possessed most\noften was marijuana. However, he also used cocaine, LSD, hallucinogenic mushrooms,\ncocaine, mescaline, quaaludes, amphetamines, and opium. In response to DOHA\ninterrogatories, Applicant stated that his \u201cdrug use has been experimental and\nsomewhat extensive over the years.\u201d (Gx. 3)\nApplicant previously held a security clearance from 1974 until 1989, and again in\nthe 1990s until 1998. (Tr. 42 - 43) Each time he has applied for a security clearance, he\nhas disclosed his drug use. However, when interviewed on at least two occasions (in\n1977 and 1993) during prior background investigations, he stated that he understood\nthat involvement with illegal drugs could jeopardize his suitability for access to classified\ninformation and that he did not intend to use drugs in the future. However, after each\nsuch statement, Applicant resumed using illegal drugs. In some cases, he has used\ndrugs with which he had not experimented in several years. For example, Applicant\nused cocaine in 1972, 1975 and 1977. Eight years later, in 1985, he decided to use it\nagain. There is a similar gap in his use of LSD. He used it in 1967 and 1968, then again\n32 years later in 2000. (Gx. 2)\nApplicant\u2019s most recent use of illegal drugs occurred between 2003 and 2006. He\nused drugs during this period in response to peer pressure. He was active in a social\ngroup that was active in environmental issues in the western United States. Drug use\nwas very common among members of that group and they viewed with suspicion\npeople who did not at least smoke marijuana. (Gx. 2; Tr. 32 - 36)\nApplicant has also bought and sold marijuana. He was arrested in 1968 and\ncharged with possession with intent to sell. However, his most recent transactions have\nbeen among friends, consisting of small amounts for personal use. As to the allegation\nthat he sold marijuana in 2006, Applicant asserted that the sale price was $50 and that\nhe sold the marijuana to be rid of it.\nApplicant avers that he has made lifestyle changes supportive of an intent to\nrefrain from future illegal drug use. Primarily, he insists that he has quit drinking heavily\nand enjoys being sober. He feels he is healthier and more active as a result of not\nsmoking marijuana or taking other drugs. (Gx. 2; Tr. 28)\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,4\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the Revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG). Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factors are:\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n4\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative factors addressed under\nAG \u00b6 15 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct) and AG \u00b6 24 (Guideline H - Drug\nInvolvement).\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n5\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  \n6\nA person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the government\nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment,\nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her\nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of\nany reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the\ngovernment.7\nAnalysis\nDrug Involvement\nThe government presented sufficient information to support all of the factual\nallegations under Guideline H. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.j) Applicant began using, buying, selling,\n\n5\nand possessing illegal drugs around 1967, when he was about 18 years old. By his own\nadmission, his drug use has been \u201cextensive over the years.\u201d Although not specifically\nalleged, Applicant\u2019s testimony indicated that he used drugs in the 1970s and 1980s\nwhile holding a security clearance through his work with defense contractors. The facts\nestablished through the government\u2019s information and through Applicant\u2019s admissions\nraise a security concern addressed in AG \u00b6 24 as follows:\nUse of an illegal drug or misuse of a prescription drug can raise questions about\nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because it may impair\njudgment and because it raises questions about a person's ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\n(a) Drugs are defined as mood and behavior altering substances, and include: \n(1) Drugs, materials, and other chemical compounds identified and listed\nin the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended (e.g., marijuana or\ncannabis, depressants, narcotics, stimulants, and hallucinogens), and (2)\ninhalants and other similar substances; \n(b) drug abuse is the illegal use of a drug or use of a legal drug in a\nmanner that deviates from approved medical direction. \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the disqualifying\nconditions listed at AG \u00b6 25(a) (any drug abuse (see definition [at AG \u00b6 25(a)]) and AG\n\u00b6 25(c) (illegal drug possession, including cultivation, processing, manufacture,\npurchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug paraphernalia). AG \u00b6 25(g) (any\nillegal drug use after being granted a security clearance), and AG \u00b6 25(h) (expressed\nintent to continue illegal drug use, or failure to clearly and convincingly commit to\ndiscontinue drug use).\nBy contrast, available information does not support application of any of the\nmitigating conditions listed at AG \u00b6 26. Given his lengthy history of frequent drug use\nover the past 32 years, Applicant\u2019s apparent abstinence from illegal drugs since 2006 is\ninsufficient to show that his drug use is not recent. Accordingly, the mitigating condition\nat AG \u00b6 26(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the\nindividual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) does not apply. \nApplicant claimed that he has made changes in his circumstances supportive of\na sober, drug-free lifestyle. However, in view of repeated failures to follow through on\nstatements to government investigators that he would no longer use drugs, despite\nknowing that involvement with illegal drugs would jeopardize his suitability for a\nclearance, he has not presented sufficient information to support his claim. The\nmitigating condition at AG \u00b6 26(b) (a demonstrated intent not to abuse any drugs in the\nfuture, such as: (1) dissociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing\nor avoiding the environment where drugs were used; (3) an appropriate period of\nabstinence; (4) a signed statement of intent with automatic revocation of clearance for\n\n6\nany violation) does not apply. In short, Applicant has failed to mitigate the security\nconcerns about his extensive history of involvement with illegal drugs.\nPersonal Conduct\nA security concern may exist when, as stated in AG \u00b6 15, available information\nreflects\n[c]onduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.\nThe government alleged, and Applicant does not contest, that in two\nsubject interviews during prior background investigations, Applicant stated that\nhe would no longer use illegal drugs. After making one such statement in 1977,\nhe used cocaine at least once in 1985, and marijuana from 1985 until 1987.\nWhen he was interviewed again in 1993, he stated that he last used marijuana in\n1988 and would not use it again. However, he resumed using marijuana in 2001.\nHe also experimented thereafter with LSD and hallucinogenic mushrooms. In\nboth interviews, Applicant stated that he understood that using illegal drugs\nwould have an adverse impact on his suitability for a security clearance. \nThe general security concern stated in AG \u00b6 15 applies to Applicant\u2019s\nlong-term involvement with illegal drugs, which he knew at all times to be criminal\nconduct. He engaged in that conduct despite holding a security clearance, and\ndespite full awareness that such conduct is incompatible with the basic personnel\nsecurity program policies. Applicant\u2019s conduct also requires application of the\ndisqualifying condition at AG \u00b6 16(b) (deliberately providing false or misleading\ninformation concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, security\nofficial, competent medical authority, or other official government representative).\nViewed together with all of the available information bearing on Applicant\u2019s drug\nuse, Applicant deliberately tried to mislead the government about his past drug\nuse and about his intentions regarding future drug use. By contrast, Applicant\nhas presented no information that would support any of the mitigating conditions\nlisted at AG \u00b6 17. On balance, he has failed to mitigate the security concerns\nabout his judgment and lack of candor.\nWhole Person Concept\nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guidelines E and H. I have also reviewed the record\nbefore me in the context of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant\nused illegal drugs willingly and extensively for over 37 years. Although he is\npresumed, at age 60, to be a mature and responsible adult, his conduct for most\nof his life does not support that presumption. He knowingly and repeatedly\nengaged in illegal conduct, at times while holding an active security clearance.\nWhile he now claims he will no longer use drugs, similar claims in the past have\n\n See footnote 4, supra.\n8\n See footnote 7, supra. \n9\n7\nproved unreliable. A fair and commonsense  evaluation of this record shows it is\n8\nhighly probable that Applicant will use illegal drugs in the future, thus\nperpetuating the doubts raised by the government\u2019s information about his ability\nor willingness to protect the government\u2019s interests as his own. Because\nprotection of the national interest is paramount in these determinations, such\ndoubts must be resolved for the government.9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by\nsection E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline H:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\n Subparagraph 1.a - 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a - 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all available information, it is not clearly consistent with the\nnational interest for Applicant to have access to classified information.

Jeffreys, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro se\nFebruary 17, 2010\n______________\nDECISION\n______________\nROSS, Wilford H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP), on August 15, 2007 (Item 5). On June 26, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings\nand Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant submitted an Answer to the SOR on September 3, 2009, and\nrequested that a decision be made without a hearing. Department Counsel submitted a\nFile of Relevant Material (FORM) to Applicant on December 1, 2009. Applicant received\nthe FORM on December 7, 2009, and was given 30 days to submit any additional\ninformation. Applicant did not submit any additional information. The case was assigned\n\n2\nto another administrative judge on February 5, 2010. It was reassigned to me on\nFebruary 8, 2010. Based upon a review of the written record eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is 48, and single. He is employed by a defense contractor and seeks to\nobtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is\nfinancially overextended and therefore at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds.  Applicant admits all of the allegations in the SOR, with the exception of\nsubparagraph 1.j., which he denies. Those admissions are hereby deemed findings of\nfact. He also submitted additional statements supporting his request for a security\nclearance.\nThe SOR alleges, and Government exhibits substantiate, 19 delinquent debts\ntotaling $25,228. Applicant admits 18 debts totaling $25,088. Some of these debts have\nbeen due and owing since 2003. (Item 6.) Regarding each of the debts he admits,\nApplicant states in his Answer, \u201cI agree, hopefully I can work of (sic) this debt.\u201d (Item 4\nat 2.) \nHe repeatedly denies owing a state tax lien in the amount of $140. (SOR 1.n.) He\nstates, \u201cI have paid it in full, not sure why I owed them money since I was in the Military\nand living in [another state] at the time.\u201d (Item 8 at 7.) The fact that he freely admits\ndebts in much larger amounts supports this statement. Based on all available evidence,\nthis subparagraph is found for Applicant. (Item 4 at 2, and Item 5 at 8.)\nApplicant states that he has a medical condition which makes it \u201chard to pay off\npast debts when most of your spare cash goes to medical bills.\u201d (Item 4 at 2.) I have\nconsidered the fact that many of his past due debts appear to be medical in nature.\nHowever, the record is otherwise devoid of explanations for his debt, or any efforts to\nresolve them. His personal financial statement showed a $356 positive cash flow as of\nDecember 2008. (Item 8 at 6.)\n \nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are to be used as appropriate in evaluating an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.\n\n3\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c),\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.  In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his own common sense,\nas well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the world, in\nmaking a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a\ncertain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk\nof compromise of classified information.\n \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny\ndetermination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).  \n\n4\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant, by his own admission, has over $25,000 in past due debts,\nall of which have been due and owing for several years. The evidence is sufficient to\nraise these potentially disqualifying conditions.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial difficulties arose recently, starting about 2003, and continue to the present. In\naddition, Applicant has failed to provide any evidence that he is paying any of his debts,\nother than his tax debt, or has any plan to do so. It is Applicant\u2019s burden to submit\nevidence showing that his financial situation has improved.  He has not done so.  This\nmitigating condition is not applicable to this case.  \nAG \u00b6 20(b) states that the disqualifying conditions may be mitigated where \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g.,. . . unexpected medical emergency . . . ), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances.\u201d  Applicant submits that he has medical problems\nthat effect his ability to pay his debts. However, a mere statement is insufficient\nevidence to conclude that he has acted responsibly towards his debts.\nApplicant has not initiated a good-faith effort to pay off his creditors.  There is no\ntrack record of his making payments for a consistent period of time.  Accordingly, AG \u00b6\n20(d) is not applicable.  Finally, given the fact that he is $25,000 in debt, I cannot find\nthat \u201cthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d\nas required by AG \u00b6 20(c).\n\n5\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination\nof whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person\nconcept. The administrative judge must consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is under financial strain,\nand has been so for several years. His debt situation is not yet under control. Under AG\n\u00b6 2(a)(3), Applicant\u2019s conduct is recent.  Based on the state of the record, I cannot find\nthat there have been permanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6 2(a)(6). Accordingly, at\nthe present time, I find that there is the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress (AG \u00b6 2(a)8); and that there is a high likelihood of recurrence (AG \u00b6 2(a)9). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nsituation.\nOn balance, I conclude that Applicant has not successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a denial of his request for a security clearance.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST THE APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst the Applicant\n\n6\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nFor the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1k:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1l:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.q:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.r:\nAgainst the Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.s:\nAgainst the Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

The record evidence shows\nApplicant has a history of financial problems or difficulties, which includes a federal tax\nlien for back taxes of $9,851 for tax year 2002. He paid the back taxes along with\ninterest and penalty, and the lien was released in December 2009. Also, he has brought\nhis past-due mortgage loan current. A small medical collection account remains\nunresolved, and he is disputing three other debts. Accordingly, as explained below, this\ncase is decided for Applicant.\nMarch 16, 2010\n\n  This case is adjudicated under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry,\n1\nsigned by President Eisenhower on February 20, 1960, as amended, as well as DoD Directive 5220.6,\nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program, dated January 2, 1992, as amended\n(Directive). In addition, the revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines), effective within the Defense Department on September 1, 2006, apply to\nthis case. They replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2 to the Directive. \n Exhibit 1. \n2\n2\nStatement of the Case\nActing under the relevant Executive Order and DoD Directive,  on June 19, 2009,\n1\nthe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (the Agency) issued a statement of\nreasons (SOR) explaining it was unable to find it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant Applicant access to classified information. The SOR is similar to a\ncomplaint, and it detailed the factual basis for the action under the security guideline\nknown as Guideline F for financial considerations. The SOR also recommended that the\ncase be submitted to an administrative judge to decide whether or not to deny or revoke\nApplicant\u2019s security clearance.  \nApplicant answered the SOR in a timely fashion and requested a hearing. His\nresponses to the SOR allegations were mixed. The case was assigned to me\nSeptember 2, 2009, The hearing took place October 28, 2009. The transcript (Tr.) was\nreceived November 5, 2009. \nThe record was held open until December 31, 2009, to allow Applicant to present\nadditional documentary evidence. Applicant made a timely submission on or about\nDecember 17, 2009, and the post-hearing matters are admitted, without objections, as\nfollows: (1) Exhibit J\u2013federal tax lien information; (2) Exhibit K\u2013mortgage loan\nstatements; and (3) Exhibit L\u2013household budget information.     \nFindings of Fact\nBased on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by\nsubstantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 51-year-old senior graphic designer who is seeking to retain an\nindustrial security clearance he has held since the 1980s.  He earned a bachelor\u2019s\n2\ndegree in 1981, and he has since worked as a graphic designer for various federal\ncontractors. He has worked for his current employer since 2006; his current annual\nsalary is about $89,000. His wife has worked as a contracts administrator since about\n2002; her current annual salary is about $89,000 as well. \nApplicant married the same year he completed college. He and his wife have\nlived at the same address since 1982. They have two children, a 23-year-old daughter\nand a 21-year-old son. The daughter recently completed college and is working a part-\ntime job while looking for a full-time position. Applicant and his wife paid for their\n\n Tr. 60\u201361. \n3\n Exhibit C. \n4\n Exhibit F. \n5\n Tr. 65. \n6\n Exhibit J. \n7\n Exhibits 3 and H. \n8\n Exhibits 3, 4, A, and I.  \n9\n3\ndaughter\u2019s college expenses, and they are currently providing her with money for\nmonthly living expenses. The son is a college student, and Applicant is paying all\neducational expenses, to include monthly living expenses. \nApplicant has a history of financial problems or difficulties. The SOR alleged six\ndelinquent debts, to include the federal tax lien and a past-due mortgage loan. Each\ndebt is addressed below in sequence per the SOR. \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a concerns the federal tax lien for $9,851. It stems from tax\nyear 2002, when Applicant took a premature withdrawal from a 401(k) retirement\naccount when his wife was required to repay approximately $9,000 for tuition assistance\nprovided by a former employer.  The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) placed the tax lien\n3\nagainst Applicant in 2007. In early March 2008, Applicant learned that he owed the IRS\nabout $13,949 for the balance, interest, and penalty.  He and his wife then entered into\n4\na repayment installment agreement with the IRS agreeing to pay $1,000 monthly\nbeginning April 2008.  Applicant or the IRS or both failed to follow up on the installment\n5\nagreement, and Applicant made no payments on the account as of October 2009.  After\n6\nthe hearing, Applicant made arrangements to resolve his account with the IRS. He and\nhis wife paid $11,583 on December 3, 2009, which satisfied the taxes owed and all\nstatutory additions, and the IRS released the lien the same day.  And although not\n7\nalleged in the SOR, Applicant resolved a somewhat related state tax debt, and that lien\nwas released in July 2008.8\nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b concerns a medical account placed for collection for $151.\nApplicant denies the debt because he believes it was paid by his health insurance\nprovider. The debt (with account number 624361) does appear as unpaid in credit\nreports from April 2008, May 2009, July 2009, and October 2009.  The credit reports\n9\nalso show that Applicant has paid numerous other medical collection accounts. \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c concerns a department store account placed for collection\nfor $997. Applicant admits the original debt owed to the department store, but he\ndisputes that he now owes the full amount to the collection agency. In 2004, Applicant\nmade arrangements with the creditor to make $234 payments to resolve the debt with\nthe last $234 forgiven. He made the payments, but the account was subsequently sold\n\n Exhibit 4. \n10\n Exhibit 3. \n11\n Exhibit K. \n12\n Exhibit 4. \n13\n Exhibits 3, A, and I. \n14\n Exhibit L. \n15\n Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \u2018right\u2019 to\n16\na security clearance\u201d); Duane v. Department of Defense, 275 F.3d 988, 994 (10  Cir. 2002) (no right to a\nth\nsecurity clearance).\n4\nto the current creditor in November 2005. All four credit reports show the account is\nunpaid, and all four credit reports show that Applicant is disputing the account\ninformation. \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d concerns a past-due mortgage loan with an approximate\nbalance of $43,739. Applicant\u2019s monthly mortgage payment is about $608. The account\nwas 120 days past due in the amount of $602 as of October 2008.  It was past due in\n10\nthe amount of $1,822 (about three payments) as of May 2009.  Applicant attributes\n11\nfalling behind on the mortgage loan to expenses he and his wife were paying for their\ncollege-age children. Quarterly mortgage statements from October and December 2009\nshow that the mortgage loan is current and in good standing.12\nThe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f concern collection accounts for $5,482 and\n$1,811. Applicant denies liability for each. The debts appear in the April 2008 credit\nreport.  The $5,482 debt is described as an unknown loan account, and the $1,811\n13\ndebt is described as a credit card account. Neither debt appears in the more recent\ncredit reports.14\nApplicant submitted written monthly and annual budgets.  The monthly budget\n15\nshows substantial outlay for his adult children, but still results in a positive net remainder\nof about $839. Of note, Applicant has no car loan payments or open credit card\naccounts. The annual budget for 2010 shows an estimated positive net remainder of\nabout $10,000. \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, the only purpose of a clearance decision is\nto decide if an applicant is suitable for access to classified information.\nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.  As\n16\nnoted by the Supreme Court in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly\n\n 484 U.S. at 531.\n17\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n18\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n19\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd.

Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n25\n5\nconsistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they\nmust, on the side of denials.\u201d  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive,\n17\nany doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of protecting national security.  \nA favorable clearance decision establishes eligibility of an applicant to be granted\na security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-secret information.  An\n18\nunfavorable decision (1) denies any application, (2) revokes any existing security\nclearance, and (3) prevents access to classified information at any level.  \n19\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n20\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n21\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n22\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n23\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.24\nThe Agency\u2019s appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.25\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a commonsense decision based upon consideration of all the relevant\nand material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication factors, and the whole-\nperson concept. \nA person granted access to classified information enters into a special\nrelationship with the government. The government must be able to have a high degree\nof trust and confidence in those persons to whom it grants access to classified\n\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n26\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6\u00b6 18, 19, and 20 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n27\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 18.  \n28\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 19(a).  \n29\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 19(c). \n30\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 20 (a) \u2013 (f) (setting forth six mitigating conditions). \n31\n6\ninformation. The decision to deny a person a security clearance is not a determination\nof an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination that an applicant has not met the\n26\nstrict guidelines the President has established for granting eligibility for access.\nAnalysis\nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations,  the suitability of an applicant\n27\nmay be questioned or put into doubt when that applicant has a history of excessive\nindebtedness, financial problems or difficulties, or financial irresponsibility. A security\nconcern typically exists due to significant unpaid debts. The overall concern under\nGuideline F is that: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information.  \n28\nSimilarly, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible,\nunconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and safeguarding classified\ninformation.   \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of\nfinancial problems or difficulties as shown by the federal tax lien and the other matters.\nThis history raises concerns because it indicates inability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts  and a history of not meeting financial obligations  within the meaning of\n29\n30\nGuideline F. The facts are more than sufficient to establish these two disqualifying\nconditions, and they suggest financial irresponsibility or inattention or both.   \nUnder \u00b6 20 of Guideline F, there are six conditions that may mitigate security\nconcerns.  The six conditions are as follows: \n31\n(a) The behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\n\n7\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) The conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) The person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n(d) The individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts;\n(e) The individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n(f) The affluence resulted from a legal source of income.\nHere, the most pertinent mitigating conditions are \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e), and each\nis discussed below.\nFirst, \u00b6 20(c) applies in Applicant\u2019s favor because his financial problems are\nbeing resolved or are under control. The record shows he resolved the debt of most\nconcern by paying more than $11,000 to the IRS; his mortgage loan is no longer past\ndue; the $151 medical collection account is unresolved, but it is so minor to be of no\ngenuine concern; and he disputes the validity of three other debts, two of which no\nlonger appear in the more recent credit reports. Given these circumstances, it appears\nApplicant is not financially overextended and he has enough positive cash flow to\nresolve any unpaid debts should legitimate demands be made.\nSecond, \u00b6 20(d) applies in Applicant\u2019s favor as well. He made good-faith efforts\nto resolve his financial problems by repaying his IRS debt and by bringing his past-due\nmortgage loan current.\nThird, \u00b6 20(e) applies in Applicant\u2019s favor for the three debts he disputes. He\nprovided adequate, although not the best, documentation of his disputes via the credit\nreports, which show he is disputing one debt (SOR \u00b6 1.c); the other two debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n1.e and 1.f) do not appear in the more recent credit reports, which tends to support the\nvalidity of Applicant\u2019s claims.   \n\n Revised Guidelines, \u00b6 2(a)(1) \u2013 (9).\n32\n8\nTo conclude, the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s history of\nfinancial problems or difficulties do not justify current doubts about his judgment,\nreliability, and trustworthiness. He presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate the concerns. In reaching this conclusion, I gave due consideration to the\nwhole-person concept.  Although Applicant did not present a perfect case in mitigation,\n32\nbased on the record evidence, along with his many years as a clearance holder, I\nassess the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress as remote to nil.\nApplicant met his ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance\ndecision. This case is decided for Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are as follows:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a\u20131.f: \nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of the record as a whole, it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

On November 20, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline B.\nThe action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 11, 2008. He\nanswered the SOR in writing, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge.\nJune 10, 2009\n\nGE 1 (Applicant\u2019s security clearance); Tr.  24-25, 40.\n1\nGE1, supra note 1, at 6; Tr. 26-28, 35, 38.\n2\n2\nDOHA received the request. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on March\n13, 2009, and I received the case assignment on March 16, 2009. DOHA issued a\nnotice of hearing on March 20, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on April\n21, 2009. The government offered one exhibit (GE) 1, which was received and admitted\ninto evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf. He submitted 17\nexhibits (AE) A through Q, which were received and admitted into evidence without\nobjection. The record closed on April 21, 2009. DOHA received the transcript of the\nhearing (Tr.) on April 29, 2009.\nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings\nNotice\nApplicant received the hearing notice on April 7, 2009. I advised Applicant of his\nright under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice before the hearing. Applicant\naffirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice. (Tr. 9-10).\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts relating to Saudi Arabia. The request and the attached documents were\nnot admitted into evidence, but were included in the record as Hearing Exhibit 1, I-IX.\nThe facts administratively noticed will be limited to matters of general knowledge and\nmatters not subject to reasonable dispute, and are set out in the Findings of Fact below.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a\nthrough 1.g of the SOR, with explanations. He also provided additional information to\nsupport his request for eligibility for a security clearance.  \nApplicant, who is 37 years old, works as a systems administrator for a\nDepartment of Defense contractor. He started his employment with this contractor in\nDecember 2007 and is working overseas.1\nApplicant was born in Saudi Arabia to African parents. At age 17, he emigrated\nfrom Saudi Arabia to the United States (U.S.) to attend college. Applicant graduated\nfrom a major U.S. university with a bachelor\u2019s degree in information systems and\nquantitative analysis. Applicant speaks English and Arabic.                 \n2\n\nGE 1, supra note 1, 2-3; AE M; Tr. 25-27, 34.\n3\nTr. 29-31, 44, 48.\n4\nTr. 31, 45-47.\n5\nId. at 28-30, 49-53.\n6\nId. at 28, 33, 53-57.\n7\n3\nApplicant married a U.S. citizen in 1991. They divorced in 2004 and remain good\nfriends. He has two stepchildren - a daughter, age 22, and a son, age 20. They consider\nhim their father. Applicant became a U.S. citizen in 2003.3\nApplicant\u2019s father owned a truck business in Saudi Arabia before he died in 1991.\nApplicant\u2019s mother, three brothers and two of his sisters are citizens of and live in Saudi\nArabia. Applicant\u2019s mother is a housewife. Applicant talks with her on the telephone\napproximately once a month about general matters. She does not work and does not\nhave contact with the Saudi government. She wants to come to the U.S. and does\nspeak and understand some English. He hopes she will be able to come to the U.S. in\n2010.4\nApplicant\u2019s oldest brother attended college in the U.S. When their father died, he\nreturned to Saudi Arabia to work and provide support for the family members still living\nin Saudi Arabia, which he continues to do. He currently works as an information\ntechnology consultant for a military hospital which is funded by the Saudi government.\nHe is not married and does not have children as far as Applicant knows.5\nApplicant\u2019s second brother is a pediatric physician in a Saudi government-funded\nhospital. He recently arrived in the U.S. to visit a sister. After the visit, he will travel to\nCanada where he will live for three years while completing a medical fellowship. His\nfuture residency plans are unknown. Applicant\u2019s youngest brother does not work, and\nhopes to attend a U.S. university. With the help of family, he is applying for college and\nhopes to arrive in the U.S. by the end of this year. These brothers are not married and\ndo not have children. Both live with his mother and older brother. If either of these\nbrothers are home when Applicant calls his mother, he will talk with them. His\nconversations with his brothers are less frequent than his conversations with his\nmother.  \n6\nApplicant\u2019s 34-year-old sister is a physician by training. She does not practice\nmedicine. His 30-year-old sister is a trained medical technician, but does not work. Both\nsisters live with his mother and brothers. His sisters are not married and do not have\nchildren. Like his brothers, if his sisters are home when he calls his mother, he will talk\nwith them. Applicant\u2019s third sister is a U.S. citizen, who lives and works in the U.S. She\nis working to bring the family members to the U.S. and has met with an immigration\nlawyer.  \n7\n\nId. at 51, 57-60, 63.\n8\nId. at 61-62.\n9\nAE M; AE N; AE O; AE P; Tr. 8.\n10\nAE A to AE L.\n11\nTr. 12, 65.\n12\n4\nApplicant does not own property in Saudi Arabia nor does he have any bank\naccounts in Saudi Arabia.  His brothers and sisters do not own property in Saudi Arabia.\nHe believes his mother owns the house where his family lives. He does not provide\nfinancial support to his family in Saudi Arabia. Applicant does not have extended family\nin Saudi Arabia. He has one college friend in Saudi Arabia. He has not spoken to his\nfriend in at least eight months.8\nIn 2005, Applicant traveled to Saudi Arabia for the first time after coming to the\nU.S. in 1988. He had not seen his mother in 17 years. He remained in Saudi Arabia for\nfive and one-half months. His current employer deployed him to an overseas\ndestination, which allowed him to visit his family in Saudi Arabia. In 2008, he took\nweekend trips to visit his family. His current deployment has taken him further away\nfrom Saudi Arabia and he is unable to travel as easily to Saudi Arabia.9\nApplicant\u2019s former spouse, her mother and her uncle wrote very favorable letters\nof recommendation. All describe him as a caring, helpful and responsible individual. His\nstepson describes Applicant as his father and has a very good relationship with\nApplicant. He describes Applicant as honorable, hardworking and selfless. Applicant\u2019s\nstepdaughter came to the hearing with him.10\nApplicant obtained 12 letters of recommendation from co-workers, including his\nArmy Commanding Officer. His Commanding Officer describes him as \u201can outstanding\nSystems Administrator who has earned his trust as a competent technician.\u201d He\ndescribes Applicant as reliable, responsible, humorous, and a man of integrity. He\nwould hire Applicant anytime to operate, maintain, and sustain the U.S. government\u2019s IT\nsystems. Co-workers portray him as an expert, with a strong work ethic. He uses proper\ncare when working with classified materials. He is intelligent, reliable, and dependable.11\nAt the hearing, Department Counsel argued that the heightened risk in this case\nconcerns the risk of terrorism in Saudi Arabia, making Applicant\u2019s family contacts a\nsecurity concern.12\nSaudi Arabia\nI take administrative notice of the following facts. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is\na monarchy ruled by the Al Saud Family. The freedoms granted to U.S. citizens under\nthe U.S. constitution are not known in Saudi Arabia. Reports of abusing and torturing\nprisoners, discrimination based on gender, religion, sect, and ethnicity, and other\n\nHE 1-I (U.S. Department of State, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices 2007: Saudi Arabia, March\n13\n11, 2008; HE 1-II (U.S. Department of State, Background Note: Saudi Arabia, January 2009): HE 1-IX (U.S.\nDepartment of State, Country Reports on Terrorism: Middle East and North Africa Overview, April 30, 2008)\np. 12-14.\nId; HE 1- VII (CRS Report for Congress Saudi Arabia: Current Issues and U.S. Relations, updated April 13,\n14\n2007).\nHE 1-IV (Press room U.S. Department of Treasury, June 19, 2008); HE 1-V (Press room U.S. Department\n15\nof Treasury, October 10, 2007); HE 1-IX, supra note 13; HE 1-VII, supra note 14, at 8. \n5\nhuman rights violations continue. The Saudi government\u2019s foreign policy objectives\nfocus on maintaining its security and paramount position on the Arabian Peninsula.\nSaudi Arabia signed the United Nations (UN) charter in 1948 and is a member of\nOPEC. Because of its position, Saudi Arabia frequently helps mediate regional crises\nand supports peace with Israel. The U.S. and Saudi Arabia differ over the Israel and\nPalestine issues, based on political ideology, and certain other policy issues concerning\nthe middle east. Friendship with Saudi Arabia is important to the U.S. Both countries\nshare common concerns about regional security, oil, and sustainable development.13\nA long standing security relationship exists between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia.\nThe U.S. established formal diplomatic relations with Saudi Arabia in 1933, which\ncontinues. Because of this relationship, the U.S. sells military equipment to Saudi\nArabia. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks in the U.S., strains in the relationship\nbetween the two countries developed. From May 2003 until June 2004, a terrorist\norganization directly affiliated with al-Qaida launched a series of violent attacks in Saudi\nArabia, resulting in death and serious injury. The Saudi security services waged an\nactive counterterrorism campaign, which largely neutralized this organization.\nThereafter, Saudi Arabia became an important partner in the campaign against\nterrorism, providing military, diplomatic and financial cooperation. This cooperation\ncontinues.14\nIn June 2008, the U.S. Treasury Department designated Al Haramain Islamic\nFoundation (AHF), with headquarters in Saudi Arabia, for providing financial and\nmaterial support to al Qaida, as well as a wide range of terrorist organizations.\nSubsequent to this designation, Saudi authorities took actions which have largely\nprecluded AHF from operating in its own name. The U.S. Treasury Department also\ndesignated the Saudi-based International Islamic Relief Organization for facilitating\nfundraising for al Qaida and affiliated terrorist groups. The Saudi government continues\nin its efforts to disrupt terror-related financial flows and continues to cooperate with the\nU.S. This cooperation has led to the arrest of 16 Saudi-based terrorism financiers and\nthe successful implementation of new Saudi Customs cash courier regulations. The\nSaudi government has seized assets of these individuals and is merging the assets of\nsuspect Saudi-based charities into a new organization to: \u201censure that the charity of\n[Saudi] citizens goes to those who need it.\u201d15\n\nHE 1-III (Travel Warning: Saudi Arabia, July 9, 2008).\n16\nAfter any decision, the losing party has a right to appeal the case to the Defense Office of Hearings and\n17\nAppeals  Appeal Board. The Appeal Board\u2019s review authority is limited to determining whether three tests are\nmet:\nE3.1.32.1. The Administrative Judge\u2019s findings of fact are supported by such relevant\nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of\nall the contrary evidence in the same record. In making this review, the Appeal Board shall\ngive deference to the credibility determinations of the Administrative Judge:\nE3.a.32.2. The Administrative Judge adhered to the procedures required by E.O. 10865\n(enclosure 1) and this Directive: or\n6\n           The U.S. Department of State has issued a travel warning for Saudi Arabia\nbecause of concerns about possible terrorist activity directed at American citizens and\nU.S. interests.            \n16\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.  \n17\n\nE3.1.32.3. The Administrative Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or\ncontrary to law.\nThe Appeal Board does not conduct a \u201cde novo determination\u201d, recognizing that its members have\nno opportunity to observe witnesses and make credibility determinations. The Supreme Court in United States\nv. Raddatz, 447 U.S. 667, 690 (1980) succinctly defined the phrase \u201cde novo determination\u201d:\n[This legal term] has an accepted meaning in the law. It means an independent determination\nof a controversy that accords no deference to any prior resolution of the same controversy.\nThus, in Renegotiation Board v. Bannercraft Clothing Co., 415 U.S. 1, 23 [(1974)], the Court\nhad occasion to define \u201cde novo proceeding\u201d as a review that was \u201cunfettered by any\nprejudice from the [prior] agency proceeding and free from any claim that the [agency\u2019s]\ndetermination is supported by substantial evidence.\u201d In United States v. First City National\nBank, 386 U.S. 361,368 [(1967)], this Court observed that \u201creview de novo\u201d means \u201cthat the\ncourt should make an independent determination of the issues\u201d and should not give any\nspecial weight to the [prior] determination of the administrative agency.\n(Internal footnotes omitted). See ISCR Case No. 07-10396 (App. Bd., Oct. 2, 2008) and ISCR Case No. 07-\n07144 (App. Bd., Oct. 7, 2008). In ISCR Case No. 05-01820 (App. Bd. Dec 14, 2006), the Appeal Board\ncriticized the administrative judge\u2019s analysis, supporting grant of a clearance for a PRC-related Applicant, and\nthen decided the case itself. Judge W hite\u2019s dissenting opinion cogently explains why credibility determinations\nand ultimately the decision whether to grant or deny a clearance should be left to the judge who makes\nwitness credibility determinations.

Sept. 29, 2008). Compliance with the Agency\u2019s rules and regulations is required. See\nUnited States ex. rel. Acardi  v. Shaughnessy, 347 U.S. 260, 268 (1954); Lopez v. FAA, 318 F.3d 242, 247-\n248 (D.C. Cir 2003); Nickelson  v. United States, 284 F. Supp.2d 387, 390 (E.D. Va. 2003)(explaining standard\nof review).\n7\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n\n8\nAnalysis\nGuideline B, Foreign Influence\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in\nAG & 6:\nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism. \nUnder the potential disqualifying conditions described in AG \u00b6 7, the following\nconditions could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case:\n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional\nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a\nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and\n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that\ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to\nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual's desire to\nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information.\nApplicant has a son and a daughter who are U.S. citizens by birth. He has one\nsister who is a U.S. resident and citizen. Thus, no security concern is raised by these\nfamily members. Applicant\u2019s mother, two sisters and two brothers are citizens and\nresidents of Saudi Arabia. A third brother is also a citizen of Saudi Arabia, currently\nliving in Canada, while completing a medical fellowship. It is not know whether he will\nreturn to Saudi Arabia when he completes his fellowship. Applicant maintains a normal,\nbut limited, familial relationship with his mother, sisters and brothers. He talks with his\nmother by telephone about once a month and his siblings when they are at home. He\nvisited his family in 2005, his first visit after leaving Saudi Arabia 17 years earlier. Since\nbeing deployed overseas, he has visited his family in Saudi Arabia on the weekend. He\ndoes not provide financial support for his family in Saudi Arabia. His family relationships\nare not per se a reason to deny Applicant a security clearance, but his contacts with\nfamily members must be considered in deciding whether to grant Applicant a clearance.\nThe government must establish that these family relationships create a heightened risk\nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion or would create\n\nUnder the old adjudicative guidelines, a disqualifying condition based on foreign family members could not\n18\nbe mitigated unless an applicant could establish that the family members were not in a position to be exploited.\nThe Appeal Board consistently applied this mitigating condition narrowly, holding that its underlying premise\nwas that an applicant should not be placed in a position where he is forced to make a choice between the\ninterest of the family member and the interest of the United States. (See ISCR Case No. 03-17620, (App. Bd,\nApr. 17, 2006); ISCR Case No. 03-24933, (App. Bd. Jul. 28, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-02382, (App. Bd. Feb.\n15, 2005); and ISCR Case No. 03-15205, (App. Bd. Jan. 21. 2005)). Thus, an administrative judge was not\npermitted to apply a balancing test to assess the extent of the security risk.\n9\na potential conflict of interest between his obligations to protect sensitive information\nand his desire to help his family members.  \nIn determining if a heightened risk exists, I must look at Applicant\u2019s relationship\nand contacts with family members as well as the activities of the government of Saudi\nArabia and terrorist organizations within these countries. See ISCR Case No. 07-05809\n(App. Bd. May 27, 2008). The risk that an applicant could be targeted for manipulation\nor induced into compromising classified information is real, not theoretical. Applicant\u2019s\nrelationship and contacts with his mother, sisters and brothers in Saudi Arabia raises a\nheightened risk of security concerns because of the activities of terrorists organizations\nin Saudi Arabia. The information of record fails to show that the Saudi government\nengages in espionage activities in the U.S. or that it targets U.S. citizens in the U.S. or\nSaudi Arabia by exploiting, manipulating, pressuring, or coercing them to obtain\nprotected information. \nUnder the new guidelines, the potentially conflicting loyalties may be weighed to\ndetermine if an applicant can be expected to resolve any conflict in favor of the U.S.\ninterests.  In determining if Applicant\u2019s contacts in Saudi Arabia cause security\n18\nconcerns, I considered that Saudi Arabia and the U.S. have a close relationship and\nthat Saudi Arabia is cooperating with the U.S. in the fight against terrorism, including\ntaking action against financiers of terror in its country. There is no evidence that the\nSaudi government targets U.S. citizens for protected information. The human rights\nissues in Saudi Arabia continue to be a concern and the terrorist organizations, not the\nSaudi government, target U.S. citizens in Saudi Arabia. While none of these\nconsiderations by themselves dispose of the issue, they are all factors to be considered\nin determining Applicant\u2019s vulnerability to pressure or coercion because of his family\nmembers in Saudi Arabia. Because of the activities of terrorist organizations in Saudi\nArabia, Applicant\u2019s recent trips to Saudi Arabia and contacts with his family in Saudi\nArabia raise a heightened risk concern under AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b).\nIn deciding if Applicant has established mitigation under AG \u00b6 8 (a), I must\nconsider: \nthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in\nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual,\ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.\n\n10\nand under AG \u00b6 8(b), I must consider whether Applicant has established:\n \nthere is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of\nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is\nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any\nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interests.\nApplicant\u2019s normal relationship with his family members is not a basis to deny\nhim a security clearance; however, his burden of proof on mitigation requires more than\nstatements about the limited scope of his conversations with his mother, three brothers\nand two sisters. See ISCR Case No. 07-02485 (App. Bd. May 9, 2008). Because the\nSaudi government funds hospitals, two of Applicant\u2019s  brothers work, at least indirectly,\nfor the Saudi government. However, his brothers, as well as his mother and sisters,\nhave never held a political position. Applicant\u2019s family has not been targeted by the\nSaudi government. His family members have never been imprisoned nor is there any\nevidence that his family members in Saudi Arabia have suffered any abuses from the\nSaudi government. His closest family members, his son and daughter, are residents of\nthe U.S. He owns no property in Saudi Arabia and keeps no financial assets In Saudi\nArabia. Balancing these factors as well as Saudi Arabia\u2019s cooperation in\ncounterterrorism, and the lack of evidence that the Saudi government targets U.S.\ncitizens for protected information against Saudi Arabia\u2019s poor human rights record, I find\nthat Applicant would resolve any conflict in favor of the U.S. interests. Likewise, any\nthreats by terrorists organizations against Applicant\u2019s family in Saudi Arabia would be\nresolved in favor of U.S. interests. His loyalties are to the U.S., not Saudi Arabia.\nApplicant has mitigated the government\u2019s security concerns as to his family contacts\nspecified in the SOR under AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b).\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\n\n11\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. The decision to grant or\ndeny a security clearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both\nfavorable and unfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the\nevidence of record, not a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is\nestablished and then whether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility\nfor a security clearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct,\nbut on a reasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a\nnexus exists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nIn reaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\nemigrated from Saudi Arabia 20 years ago while a teenager. He has lived his entire\nadult life in the U.S.  His values and preferences have been guided by his experiences\nin the U.S., leading to his decision to become a U.S. citizen in 2003. Two brothers work\nfor hospitals, which are funded by the Saudi government. Neither brother works directly\nfor the Saudi government. Outside of these two indirect jobs, none of Applicant\u2019s family\nmembers have any connection with the Saudi government and its day to day\noperations. His mother, sisters and brothers live quietly. They are not political activists\nnor do they have any connection with terrorists.\nApplicant has regular contact with his mother, but less frequent contact with his\nsiblings. Even his limited contact could, under certain circumstances, raise a serious\nsecurity concern. Those circumstances are not present in this case because the Saudi\ngovernment does not conduct espionage activities against the U.S. The record lacks\nany evidence that the Saudi government seeks to obtain classified documents from the\nU.S. and thus, it is highly unlikely that the Saudi government will attempt to coerce,\npressure or exploit U.S. citizens to obtain classified information. While there remains a\nserious human rights issue in Saudi Arabia, there is little likelihood that Applicant will be\nplaced in a position to provide classified information to the Saudi government or that his\nfamily members will be harmed by the Saudi government given its present relationship\nwith the U.S. Because the Saudi government is actively and comprehensively\nconfronting terrorism and its funding sources, threats of harm from these organizations\nhas significantly decreased. After considering all the evidence of record, I find that\noverall, there is little risk that Applicant will violate the security procedures by providing\nclassified information to the government of Saudi Arabia.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\n\n12\nParagraph 1, Guideline B:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, dated July 7, 2009, Applicant denied the factual allegations in all paragraphs of the SOR. He also provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance. Applicant is 39 years old, married for 14 years, and has three children. He works for a defense contractor. He started that job in November 2007. He currently has a security clearance and has had a clearance since 2001. (Tr. 55-58; Exhibit 1) Applicant worked for another defense contractor from November 2005 until October 25, 2007, a Thursday. On that day, the employer terminated Applicant for cause. He is not eligible for rehiring by the company. The reason for termination was the use of his employer\u2019s computer to access child pornography websites on the internet during work hours. The employer installed software on its computers on October 19, 2007, to track any employee\u2019s access to the internet. Applicant was identified as one of those employees accessing pornographic websites during work hours. The company software discovered Applicant went to the child pornography website 14 times between 0920 and 0924 on October 22, 2007, using the company computer, and downloaded onto his company computer numerous pictures of nude and/or sexually explicit young pre-teen and teenage boys. (Tr. 24-39, 57, Exhibit 2 to 6) The company shipped the hard drive from Applicant\u2019s computer to their headquarters for examination by the local police forensic unit. ",

Benson, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOWE, Philip S., Administrative Judge: \n \nOn January 16, 2008, Applicant submitted his electronic Security Clearance \nApplication (SF 86) (e-QIP). On June 28, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guidelines D (Sexual Behavior), E (Personal Conduct), M (Use of \nInformation Technology Systems), and J (Criminal Conduct). The action was taken \nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 30, 2009. He answered the \nSOR in writing on July 7, 2009, and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. \nDOHA received the request on July 13, 2009. Department Counsel was prepared to \nproceed on July 21, 2009, and I received the case assignment on August 27, 2009. \n \n1 \n \n \nFebruary 24, 2010\n\n \n2 \n \n \nDOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on October 29, 2009, and I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on November 18, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits 1 through 8, which \nwere received without objection, except for Exhibit 4. I considered the objection and \noverruled it, admitting the exhibit into evidence. Applicant testified. He submitted \nExhibits A and B, which were admitted without objection. (Tr. 53, 54) DOHA received \nthe transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 1, 2009. Based upon a review of the \ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is denied.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nMotion to Amend SOR \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by adding to \u00b6 1.b, after \u201cimages \nof\u201d the words, \u201cnude and/or sexually explicit.\u201d Applicant objected on the basis the \ngovernment originally could have written the allegation that way but failed to do so. I \noverruled the objection and allowed the amendment because it was a clarifying \namendment within the context of the existing allegations. (Tr. 8-11)  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated July 7, 2009, Applicant denied the factual \nallegations in all paragraphs of the SOR. He also provided additional information to \nsupport his request for eligibility for a security clearance.   \n \nApplicant is 39 years old, married for 14 years, and has three children. He works \nfor a defense contractor. He started that job in November 2007. He currently has a \nsecurity clearance and has had a clearance since 2001. (Tr. 55-58; Exhibit 1) \n \nApplicant worked for another defense contractor from November 2005 until \nOctober 25, 2007, a Thursday. On that day, the employer terminated Applicant for \ncause. He is not eligible for rehiring by the company. The reason for termination was the \nuse of his employer\u2019s computer to access child pornography websites on the internet \nduring work hours. The employer installed software on its computers on October 19, \n2007, to track any employee\u2019s access to the internet. Applicant was identified as one of \nthose employees accessing pornographic websites during work hours. The company \nsoftware discovered Applicant went to the child pornography website 14 times between \n0920 and 0924 on October 22, 2007, using the company computer, and downloaded \nonto his company computer numerous pictures of nude and/or sexually explicit young \npre-teen and teenage boys. (Tr. 24-39, 57, Exhibit 2 to 6) \n \nThe company shipped the hard drive from Applicant\u2019s computer to their \nheadquarters for examination by the local police forensic unit. The police department \ndiscovered child pornographic images on Applicant\u2019s hard drive. The police department \nalso discovered that Applicant had installed Lime Wire on his hard drive. He made this \ninstallation without authority or permission from his employer. This software is used to \n\n \n3 \n \n \nshare downloaded images, including those of child pornography. The police sent the \nrecovered child pornographic images to the National Center for Missing and Exploited \nChildren (NCMEC) for identification purposes. The NCMEC identified 22 images as \nknown child pornographic images. The police department report is dated November 29, \n2007. (Tr. 24-39; Exhibits 2-5) \n \nA company vice-president testified that he was Applicant\u2019s supervisor. The vice-\npresident has worked in government contracting for 44 years and has had a security \nclearance for many of those years. Applicant used a company computer at work. The \ncompany had a policy against excessive internet use of the computer not related to \ncompany work. The company had problems with employees engaging in such usage for \nconsiderable periods of time. After the installation of computer monitoring software on \nFriday October 19, 2007, the company identified six employees at the vice-president\u2019s \nwork location who were using the internet excessively. One of those persons identified \nwas Applicant, who worked in the vice-president\u2019s division, as the security officer and \nsafety officer. All six persons were terminated. The vice-president obtained information \nfrom the computer staff about Applicant\u2019s internet use during the work day. He was \ninformed that Applicant was looking at child pornography sites and was sometimes \nspending up to six hours a day on the internet. The vice-president told Applicant that he \nwas terminated and had to depart the building immediately with his personal items or \nreturn the following day to get his property while being escorted in the building. He \nmade it clear to Applicant that he was fired from the job and for what reason.  \nApplicant\u2019s company badge was taken from him at that time. Applicant was not eligible \nfor rehiring. He did not tell Applicant he was \u201claid off.\u201d Later that day, Applicant\u2019s \ncomputer was dismantled and the hard drive was sent to the company headquarters. \nThe vice-president described Applicant as an average employee and somewhat \ndedicated to his work. (Tr. 24-39, 43, 45, 46, 63, 71, 72; Exhibits 6-8) \n \nApplicant applied for unemployment compensation and obtained it after his \ntermination. He was paid for one month. Under the applicable state law, a former \nemployer may contest the awarding of unemployment compensation. This employer, \naccording to the vice-president, usually does not oppose the unemployment \ncompensation and did not do so in this case. (Tr. 38-40, 76, 77, 80; Exhibit 7) \n \nApplicant denied he downloaded the pornographic pictures onto his office \ncomputer. He claimed it was a hand-me-down computer which the company placed in \nhis office. He used a laptop computer for other business purposes. Applicant testified \nthat his office computer was used by new applicants for company jobs to complete their \nsecurity applications. The job applicants would do research on the computer to be able \nto complete the applications. He did not monitor their activities, but only answered their \nquestions. He does not know how the pornographic pictures appeared on his company \ncomputer. (Tr. 59-66)  \n \nApplicant denies installing computer software named \u201cLime wire\u201d on his company \ncomputer. He claims his computer was a \u201chand-me-down\u201d computer and he was the \n\n \n4 \n \n \nthird user. Applicant denies all wrongdoing regarding his computer and internet access \nas alleged in the SOR. (Tr. 78-98, 101-104)  \n \nApplicant completed his e-QIP on January 16, 2008. He answered Question 22 \nregarding being fired from a job in the past seven years, quitting a job after being told he \nwould be fired, departed a job following allegations of misconduct, or by mutual \nagreement after allegations of unsatisfactory performance, or for any other reason \nunder unfavorable circumstances with a negative reply. Applicant did not disclose the \nOctober 25, 2007, termination from his former employer. He considered himself \n\u201creleased\u201d not terminated. Applicant testified that he did not learn of the reasons for his \ntermination until 2008. (Tr. 66-75, 94; Exhibit 8)  \n \nApplicant submitted three character statements as part of his Answer. He also \nsubmitted his checking account statement from November 2007 showing the \nunemployment compensation deposits. The character statements present Applicant as \nresponsible and well-organized, an excellent security officer, and helpful in organizing \nan open house in 2008 at his work place. (Tr. 98, 99; Answer) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n\n \n5 \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \n \n \nAG \u00b6 12 expresses the security concern under this guideline: \n \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or \nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may \nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or \nduress can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness \nand ability to protect classified information. No adverse inference \nconcerning the standards in this Guideline may be raised solely on the \nbasis of the sexual orientation of the individual. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 13 describes four conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. All of them are applicable here: \n \n(a) sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has \nbeen prosecuted; \n \n(b) a pattern of compulsive, self-destructive, or high risk sexual behavior \nthat the person is unable to stop or that may be symptomatic of a \npersonality disorder; \n \n(c) sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(d) sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that reflects lack of discretion \nor judgment. \n \n \nApplicant spent up to six hours daily looking at pornographic websites on his \ncompany\u2019s computer between October 22 and 25, 2007. This action was contrary to \ncompany policy. The government\u2019s exhibits and the testimony of the company official \nare very credible on this issue. Viewing child pornography and downloading it to a \ncomputer is contrary to law and policy. AG \u00b6 13 (a) applies. \n \n \nThe frequency of Applicant\u2019s actions shows a pattern of compulsive and self-\ndestructive sexual behavior. He was not able to stop his actions. AG \u00b6 13 (b) applies. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior makes him vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress, if \nknown to the public. Applicant does not want to be known as a husband and father who \nviews child pornography at work sites. AG \u00b6 13 (c) applies. Applicant\u2019s actions show a \nlack of discretion or judgment. AG \u00b6 13 (d) applies.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 14 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. None of these \nmitigating conditions apply on the facts presented by Applicant: \n \n(a) the behavior occurred prior to or during adolescence and there is no \nevidence of subsequent conduct of a similar nature; \n \n(b) the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under \nsuch unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(c) the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and,  \n \n(d) the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet. \n  \n \nApplicant\u2019s general denials of any misconduct and inappropriate use of the \ncompany computer is not credible or persuasive. He offers no concrete evidence that \nany of these mitigating conditions apply. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \n\n \n7 \n \n \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or \nadministrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility: \n \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a \nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or \nreleases, and cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation; and, \n \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes seven conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying.  One condition applies because of the allegation of failure to answer \nthe question truthfully on the e-QIP pertaining to his job loss in the past seven years: \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nApplicant did not disclose in answering Question 22 of the e-QIP that he had \nbeen terminated on October 25, 2007, by his employer. This condition applies. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of \nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual \nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, \nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or \noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules \nand regulations. \n  \n \nUnder the evidence Applicant introduced at the hearing none of the mitigating \nconditions apply. Applicant denies he was terminated, only \u201creleased\u201d from work by his \nemployer. He also contends his receipt of unemployment compensation after his \ntermination is determinative of the issue that he was not terminated. The testimony of \nthe company vice-president was conclusive on this aspect of the event. The company \nfor which Applicant worked does not usually contest unemployment compensation \nclaims. Applicant only received compensation for one month before he obtained another \njob.   \n \nGuideline M, Use of Information Technology Systems \n \n \nAG \u00b6 39 expresses the security concern pertaining to use of information \ntechnology systems: \n \nNoncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations \npertaining to information technology systems may raise security concerns \nabout an individual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question \nthe willingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, \nand information. Information Technology Systems include all related \ncomputer hardware, software, firmware, and data used for the \ncommunication, transmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or \nprotection of information. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 40 describes eight conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying. Four conditions apply in this case: \n \n(a) illegal or unauthorized entry into any information technology system or \ncomponent thereof; \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(b) illegal or unauthorized modification, destruction, manipulation or denial \nof access to information, software, firmware, or hardware in an information \ntechnology system; \n \n(e) unauthorized use of a government or other information technology \nsystem; and \n \n(f) introduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, software, or \nmedia to or from any information technology system without authorization, \nwhen prohibited by rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations. \n \n \nApplicant used his company\u2019s computer to illegally access child pornography \nwebsites, and other sexually explicit material, during work hours in violation of company \npolicy. He installed \u201cLime ware\u201d file sharing software on his computer\u2019s hard drive \nwithout authority from his company. Each of these four disqualifying conditions applies \nbecause of the modifications Applicant made without authority to his company\u2019s \ncomputer that was assigned to him, as well as his subsequent actions on the computer.   \n \n \nAG \u00b6 41 provides three conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the misuse was minor and done only in the interest of organizational \nefficiency and effectiveness, such as letting another person use one's \npassword or computer when no other timely alternative was readily \navailable; and \n \n(c) the conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a \nprompt, good-faith effort to correct the situation and by notification of \nsupervisor. \n  \n  \nNone of these mitigating conditions apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. His behavior is \nrecent, deliberate, not minor, and done for his own gratification and benefit. Applicant \nmade no effort to correct the situation. His general and repeated denials are not \npersuasive. There is no counseling or rehabilitation shown, hence no evidence that \nsimilar conduct is unlikely to recur. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes five conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Two conditions apply: \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted. \n \n \nApplicant illegally viewed pornographic websites and downloaded numerous \nimages of nude and/or sexually explicit photographs of young pre-teen and teenage \nboys onto his company computer during work days. Such viewing and downloading \nover four days in October 2007 are repeated criminal actions. Applicant was never \nindicted or tried in criminal court for his alleged actions. But he did not have to be \nconvicted of the allegations for the disqualifying condition to apply.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32 provides four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; \n \n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life; \n \n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \nNone of them apply. The time since Applicant used his company computer to \naccess the sex sites is comparatively recent. Applicant was not pressured into looking \nat these sites. He did commit the actions. Applicant denies any of the access activities, \nso there is no rehabilitation if the Applicant does not acknowledge the misbehavior.  \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires each case must be judged on its own merits.  Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the \nultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an \noverall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and \nthe whole-person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was an adult, husband, \nand father when he accessed pornographic sites from his office computer. He denies \nanything wrong ever occurred, or that he was terminated for misconduct by his \nemployer in October 2007. He accessed the sites daily. There is no evidence Applicant \nshowed that he underwent any rehabilitation for viewing child pornography because he \ndenies he ever accessed the pornography. His denials are not credible when compared \nto the detailed documents and testimony presented documenting his misconduct.   \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant did not mitigate the security concerns arising from his sexual \nbehavior, personal conduct, information technology systems use, and criminal conduct. \nI conclude the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept against Applicant. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline D:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline M:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 3.b:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 4, Guideline J:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 4.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nPHILIP S. HOWE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nApplicant signed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) version of a security clearance application (SF-86) on August 10, 2007. The\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) on July 30, 2010, detailing security concerns under Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct), Guideline M (Use of Information Technology Systems), and\nGuideline K (Handling Protected Information), that provided the basis for its preliminary\ndecision to deny him a security clearance. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nMarch 25, 2011\n\nAE F and AE G are letters of congratulations from 2005.

Directive, \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cThat burden has two components. First, the\ngovernment must establish by substantial evidence that the facts and events alleged in the SOR indeed took\nplace. Second, the government must establish a nexus between the existence of the established facts and\nevents and a legitimate security concern.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 07-18525 at 4 (App. Bd.

He answered\nthe SOR in writing on August 25, 2010. Applicant requested a decision on the record.\nHowever, pursuant to Paragraph E3.1.7. of the Additional Procedural Guidance of\nEnclosure 3 of the Directive, Department Counsel requested a hearing before an\nadministrative judge on September 28, 2010. (Hearing Exhibit 1) Department Counsel\nwas prepared to proceed on October 28, 2010, and I received the case assignment on\nNovember 3, 2010. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on November 12, 2010, and I\nconvened the hearing as scheduled on December 16, 2010. The Government offered\nexhibits marked as GE 1 through 14, which were admitted into evidence without\nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted exhibits marked as AE A through E, which\nwere admitted into evidence without objection. I held the record open until December\n23, 2010, for Applicant to submit additional matters. Applicant timely submitted AE F\nthrough AE I without objection.  The record closed on December 23, 2010. DOHA\n1\nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on December 28, 2010.\nProcedural Ruling\nMotion to Amend the SOR \nAt the end of the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend allegation 1.b of\nthe SOR to conform with the hearing testimony. Specifically, Department Counsel asked\nto change the words \u201ccompany laptop\u201d to \u201cpersonal laptop.\u201d Applicant did not object to\namending the SOR. (Tr. 129-131) The Motion to Amend was granted, and allegation 1.b\nof the SOR was changed as requested.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c,\n1.d, and 1.e of the SOR.

He also provided additional information to support\nhis request for eligibility for a security clearance. After a complete and thorough review\nof the evidence of record, I make the following additional findings of fact.  \nApplicant, who is 55 years old, works as a communications engineer for a\nDepartment of Defense contractor. He began his current employment with this\ncontractor in January 2004.  He is chief of his communications engineering department\n3\nand holds a fellowship position with his employer, as he is an expert in his are of\ncommunications. His employer states that he is a very talented and experienced\nengineer, and rated him as an exceptional contributor in his most recent evaluation. His\nevaluations for the last six years have rated him as high contributor or exceptional.  \n4\nFrom 2004 through 2006, Applicant, a civilian, worked overseas, in or near the\nIraq war zone. While overseas, he received several awards and other recognition for his\ntechnical excellence and work performance. Through his ideas and abilities, he also\ncontributed significantly to the development of a communications systems now used by\nthe military. He served in the military reserves and on active duty for 12 years, from\nDecember 1979 through May 1985 and April 1987 through November 1993. Applicant\nheld a security clearance during his military duty and after his military service. There is\nno evidence that he mishandled classified information or violated the rules for handling\nclassified information at any time.  \n5\nApplicant married in 1977. He has two sons, who are now 29 and 24 years old.\nHe attended college and earned an associate\u2019s degree. He taught himself many of his\ncurrent skills. He holds industry and Federal Communications Commission licenses in\ncommunication infrastructure. Since 1997, Applicant has worked in his area of\ncommunications expertise.6\nIn 1986, Applicant worked for the local police department in a rural town. He also\nstarted and operated a part-time radio business, which eventually included two partners,\nwho were the local Chief of Police and a councilman. His communications business\nreceived used radio items from the police department and a variety of other\ncommunications equipment from different sources. In April 1986, Applicant arrived at\nwork to find that someone had broken into the radio shop and taken one item. He\nreported the break-in to the police, who investigated. The local police determined that\nthe burglary appeared to be an inside job and identified a suspect, who was an\nemployee of the radio shop. The employee-suspect told the local police that Applicant\nand he stole mobile radio units from cars in the local area and that Applicant most likely\n\nThere is no evidence in the record which supports this statement.\n7\nGE 10; GE 11.\n8\nGE 10; GE 12; GE 14.\n9\nGE 2.\n10\n4\ndisposed of the items stolen in the burglary in April 1986.  During the investigation, the\n7\nlocal police found five federal interceptor sirens from an out-of-state police department,\nwhich had been given to the Applicant by a police officer from the out-of-state police\ndepartment. Because the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was conducting an\ninvestigation on the interstate transportation of stolen property, the local police\ncontacted the FBI. The FBI investigated Applicant. The FBI contacted the out-of-state\npolice officer, who confirmed that he and Applicant traded communications equipment,\nas the police officer also had a communication equipment business, and that he\nmistakenly shipped Applicant the sirens. A month after their initial investigation, the local\npolice searched Applicant\u2019s business and seized several items with missing serial\nnumbers, including a radio reported stolen in another state. The police arrested\nApplicant following their search and seizure.8\nAt the conclusion of the FBI investigation, the federal prosecutor declined to\nproceed in court. The State, however, indicted Applicant on 12 counts of criminal use of\narticle with altered identification mark because the serial number had been removed on\nvarious equipment found in his business shop. The indictment does not indicate if the\ncrimes for which Applicant was charged were misdemeanors or  felonies, although the\nFBI criminal records report does indicate at least one charge was a felony offense. In\n1988, the state filed a motion for Nolle Prosequi, which the court granted on August 19,\n1988. The record contains no additional evidence of criminal conduct. Applicant did not\nlist his felony arrest on his SF 86.9\nIn his first statement to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator\non February 19, 2009, Applicant discussed the radio communications business he\noperated. He acknowledged being arrested for no serial numbers on walkie-talkies, then\nindicated he was released a few hours later because the radio company told the police\nthat the walkie-talkies were a gift. When asked by the investigator about why he failed to\nlist his 1986 arrest, he stated that he misunderstood the question. He thought the\nquestion asked if he had ever served a sentence for a crime he committed.10\nApplicant met with the OPM investigator a second time on April 1, 2009 to\ndiscuss charges listed on the FBI criminal records report. Specifically, they discussed\nthe 1986 charges of receiving stolen property from another state, severity unknown;\ncriminal use of an article with an altered identification mark, a felony; and acquiring a\nlicense plate for the purpose of concealing the identification of a motor vehicle, a\nmisdemeanor. Applicant told the OPM investigator that the charge of receiving stolen\nproperty was made by his business partners and was related to the walkie-talkies. He\nstated that he turned himself in to the police; that he remained in jail for a few hours;\n\nId.; Tr. 52-58, 77-81.\n11\nGE 3; GE 4; GE 5; Tr. 40.\n12\nTr. 40-41, 48, 59-60, 86-90.\n13\nId. at 40-42, 46, 63-64, 72-73, 86-87, 101, 107-110.\n14\n5\nthat he talked to his business partners; and that his business partners agreed to drop\nthe charges if he turned over his share of the business to them and would not sue them.\nHe denied any knowledge of a bond being requested for him on these charges and of\nbeing charged with felony crimes. He thought these crimes were misdemeanors.11\nIn June 2002, he accepted a position as the Director of Engineering with a\ncompany many miles from his residence. In its offer letter, the company agreed to pay\nhim a salary of $70,000 a year, plus benefits. The offer letter noted that the State where\nhe would work was an employment-at-will State and that the letter did not constitute an\nemployment contract. The company asked him to sign a non-competition and non-\ndisclosure agreement, which he signed on June 27, 2010. The company agreed to pay\n$10,000 for his moving expenses, conditioned upon his working for the company for two\nyears. The offer letter does not discuss the procedure for him to resign. After he moved,\nApplicant received a bill from the movers for over $20,000. The company agreed to pay\nthe additional moving expenses, if Applicant agreed to remain in the company\u2019s\nemployment for three years.12\nApplicant began his employment in July 2002. His job required him to design and\nbuild communication towers and shelters, not to write software. His work involved\ncontracts with the Department of Defense and the State. After his arrival, the company\nhired his wife as the shop manager and his oldest son as an information technologist\n(IT). Although Applicant testified that this was part of his hiring contract, the offer letter\ndoes not include an offer of employment for his wife and son. The company extended\nan offer of employment to Applicant\u2019s family members after he began work.13\nFor his first year of employment, Applicant performed his work duties on his\npersonal laptop and transferred the information to the company\u2019s main server for access\nby other employees. Even though he received a company laptop computer late in the\nsummer of 2003, he continued performing most of his work on his personal computer\nand transferring the work to the company server. To do his work, Applicant used\nsoftware containing a licensing key, which is an electronic code needed to enter the\ncontrol portion of the system and allow the software to operate. The licensing key has\nno monetary value or security classification. The licensing key needed to be installed on\nall equipment related to radios and for repairs. It was on his personal computer, but not\nhis company computer.14\nThe company was delighted with Applicant\u2019s work during the first year of his\nemployment. The working relationship between Applicant and the company began to\ndeteriorate in the summer of 2003. The company laid off his wife in 2003, because it\n\nId. at 43-44, 89-90, 94.\n15\nGE 7.\n16\n6\nwas not satisfied with her work, and it reduced the working hours of his son, as it did not\nneed a full-time IT person. Applicant believed the company had financial problems\nbecause it laid off other staff, and he was concerned that the company would fail. The\ncompany acknowledged that it had some financial problems in the fall of 2003. He\nbelieved the company had problems paying vendors, but the company denied this\nassertion of Applicant. Applicant found other work and asked the company about\nworking part time or moonlighting. The company declined, stating that it needed him to\nwork full time. On November 25, 2003, Applicant sent the company an e-mail, advising\nthat he was resigning his position immediately for reasons already known to the\ncompany. He left his locked company laptop, company cell phone with charger, keys,\ncredit card, gas card, and cold weather gear in his locked office. He also advised the\ncompany he would contact them soon about \u201ctaking care of the relocation issue.\u201d\nApplicant moved from the state by mid-December.15\nApplicant\u2019s sudden departure created problems for the company. In particular,\nthe company discovered that Applicant had erased the system design and the\nprogramming for its radio equipment, but not all information on their computer server.\nApplicant erased work-in-progress and select information from various locations on the\nnetwork. As a result, the company had to recreate all internal radio programs and\ndesigns. On December 1, 2003, the company\u2019s attorney wrote a letter to Applicant\nasking 1) if he was in possession of a DoD system key and programming templates for\ncertain radio programs he designed and related records; and 2) if he had proprietary\nsoftware which he used to build his designs. The letter also indicated that he had\npossession of a satellite phone, a specific scanner, 10 company shirts, and two jackets,\nand that if he did not return this equipment and clothing, the company would bill him for\nthe costs. The company requested reimbursement for his moving costs and payment of\noutstanding invoices for equipment he had purchased and restoration of the work he\nhad deleted. The company acknowledged that he did not use the key system after he\nleft his employment, and the record contains no evidence that the company\u2019s\nproprietary information was provided to another person or company.  \n16\nApplicant and the company agreed that he returned the items requested.\nHowever, in March 2004, the company filed a lawsuit against Applicant, alleging breach\nof contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, conversion of tangible\npersonal property, and conversion of certain confidential proprietary personal property.\nThe company sought damages of $86,000, which included the previously paid moving\nexpenses. The court papers were served on a resident of Applicant\u2019s new home in May\n2004, although Applicant lived and worked overseas at this time. In September 2004,\nApplicant prepared and mailed a motion for continuance under the Service Member\nRelief Act, 50 U.S.C. App. 521, Sections 201 and 514, as he was serving overseas in a\nwar zone. At the same time, counsel for the company filed a motion for a default\n\nGE 8; GE 9; AE D.\n17\nGE 8; GE 9.\n18\nId.\n19\n7\njudgment because Applicant had not filed an answer to the lawsuit. The court entered a\ndefault judgment on October 6, 2004.  \n17\nShortly thereafter, Applicant hired an attorney, who entered an appearance in the\nlawsuit on October 15, 2004. Upon motion of Applicant\u2019s counsel, the court set aside\nthe default judgment on November 24, 2004. Through counsel, Applicant submitted an\nanswer to the civil complaint, wherein he denied the majority of claims and allegations\nof the company and raised three affirmative defenses to the lawsuit. He also filed a\ncounterclaim against the company for unpaid wages and defamation for wrongful\naccusations of theft of property. Over the next year, the lawsuit proceeded slowly with\nmotions and trial continuances.18\nAt some point, Applicant advised his counsel that he would be available for the\ntrial in January 2006. The court scheduled the trial for January 17, 2006. Applicant did\nnot appear for the trial, but was represented by his counsel. The court entered its\ndecision on January 20, 2006. After hearing testimony and reviewing the evidence, the\ncourt found that Applicant violated the employment agreement, and the company was\nentitled to recover his moving expenses in the amount of $20,772. The court also found\nthat the information lost in the company\u2019s main computer system occurred because\nApplicant deleted the information and awarded the company $9,035 in damages. The\ncourt entered judgment in the amount of $29,807 plus prejudgment interest of $5,532,\ncourt costs of $420, and attorney fees of $5,481 in favor of the company and against\nApplicant. The court decision does not contain any findings on Applicant\u2019s counterclaim.\nApplicant paid the judgment in full in November 2008.19\nAt his security clearance hearing, Applicant explained his conduct in a manner\nsimilar to the defenses raised in the lawsuit filed against him by the company. He did\nnot acknowledge deleting any information from the company\u2019s computer system.\nRather, he indicated the licensing key was on all of the company\u2019s computers, meaning\naccess was available to the company.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n8\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d An\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion for obtaining a favorable security\ndecision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline E: Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\n\n9\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16  describes the disqualifying conditions that could raise security\nconcerns. I have considered all the conditions, and especially the following:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;\n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is\nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single\nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not\nproperly safeguard protected information;\n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any\nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse\ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information\nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment,\nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply\nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the\nperson may not properly safeguard protected information. This includes\nbut is not limited to consideration of:\n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of\nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information,\nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or other\ngovernment protected information:\n(2) disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior in the\nworkplace; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and,\n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other\nemployer's time or resources;\n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct,\nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such\nas (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person's\n\n10\npersonal, professional, or community standing, or (2) while in another\ncountry, engaging in any activity that is illegal in that country or that is\nlegal in that country but illegal in the United States and may serve as a\nbasis for exploitation or pressure by the foreign security or intelligence\nservice or other group; and\n(f) violation of a written or recorded commitment made by the individual to\nthe employer as a condition of employment.\nDuring his employment with the company, Applicant worked primarily on his\npersonal computer. He routinely transferred his work product from his personal\ncomputer to the company\u2019s main computer server, making the work accessible to other\nemployees. When Applicant resigned from the company in 2003, he left the company\ncomputer in his company office. He, however, took his personal computer with him\nwhich contained company proprietary information. He erased the proprietary information\nrelated to the work he performed and transferred to the company\u2019s computer server\nfrom the company server, causing harm to the company. The company filed a lawsuit\nagainst him and the court entered a judgment against him for the harm caused. The\npolice arrested him 1986 and charged him with several misdemeanor and felony crimes.\nThe Government established its case for allegations 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d under AG \u00b6\u00b6\n16(c), 16(d), 16(e) and 16(f). Because Applicant left the company computer in his office\nthe day he resigned and the offer letter does not provide any requirements for resigning,\nSOR allegation 1.a is found in favor of Applicant.\nFor AG \u00b6 16(a) to apply, Applicant\u2019s omission, concealment or falsification of\nrelevant facts on his e-QIP must be deliberate. The Government established that\nApplicant omitted a material fact from his SF-86 when he answered \u201cno\u201d to Question\n23a, about his criminal felony charges in 1986. This information is material to the\nevaluation of Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness to hold a security clearance and to his honesty.\nIn his response, he denies, however, that he had an intent to hide this information from\nthe Government. \nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted, the Government has the burden of\nproving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove an\napplicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when the omission occurred. See ISCR Case No.\n07\u201300196 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2009); ISCR Case No. 09-07551 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2011)\nIn evaluating whether the Government has presented substantial evidence regarding\nthe deliberate nature of a false statement or an omission, the Judge must examine the\nstatement or omission in light of the record as a whole. Id. In making this determination,\nthe administrative judge must determine whether there is direct or circumstantial\nevidence concerning an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission\noccurred.\nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted that he knew this information\nwhen he completed the SF 86 and that he sought to conceal the information about his\narrest in 1986. He explained at the hearing and in his second interview with the OPM\n\n11\ninvestigator that he thought the charges were for misdemeanor crimes and had thought\nso for 25 years. These statements are contrary to his initial statement to the OPM\ninvestigator that he thought he need only list crimes for which he served time. His\ninconsistent statements explaining his answer negatively impact the reliability of his\nexplanation for his \u201cno\u201d answer to Question 23a in the SF 86. The Government has\nestablished intentional falsification.\nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts;\n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was\ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or inadequate advice of\nauthorized personnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual\nspecifically concerning the security clearance process. Upon being made\naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the\nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully;\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is\nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is\nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling\nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the\nstressors, circumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable,\nor other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur;\n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate\nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;\n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable\nreliability; and\n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity has ceased or\noccurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply with rules\nand regulations.\nBecause the factual statement contained in SOR allegation 1.c relates to the\nconduct raised in SOR allegation 1.b, allegation 1.c is found in favor of Applicant.\nAllegation 1.d concerns criminal charges which the State decided not to pursue after\nexamining all the evidence. Given the decision of the State, this allegation is found in\nfavor of Applicant. He, however, has not mitigated the security concerns raised in\nallegations 1.b and 1.e.\n\n12\nGuideline M: Use of Information Technology Systems\nAG \u00b6 39 expresses the security concern pertaining to use of information\ntechnology systems:\nNoncompliance with rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations pertaining\nto information technology systems may raise security concerns about an\nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, calling into question the\nwillingness or ability to properly protect sensitive systems, networks, and\ninformation. Information Technology Systems include all related computer\nhardware, software, firmware, and data used for the communication,\ntransmission, processing, manipulation, storage, or protection of\ninformation.\nAG \u00b6 40 describes the disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns.\nI have considered all the conditions, and especially the following:\n(b) illegal or unauthorized modification, destruction, manipulation or denial\nof access to information, software, firmware, or hardware in an information\ntechnology system; and\n(f) introduction, removal, or duplication of hardware, firmware, software, or\nmedia to or from any information technology system without authorization,\nwhen prohibited by rules, procedures, guidelines or regulations.\nWhen he resigned his position with the company, Applicant decided to erase\nmuch of his work product from the company\u2019s main computer system. The information\ndeleted from the company\u2019s main computer system was not haphazard or all\ninformation, but selectively chosen information and primarily related to Applicant\u2019s work\nfor the company. Applicant\u2019s actions are a violation of the company\u2019s policies and\ngeneral workplace rules governing work products which are the proprietary information\nof the company. The Government has established a prima facie case under Guideline\nM. \nAG \u00b6 41 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\n(b) the misuse was minor and done only in the interest of organizational\nefficiency and effectiveness, such as letting another person use one's\npassword or computer when no other timely alternative was readily\navailable; and,\n\n13\n(c) the conduct was unintentional or inadvertent and was followed by a\nprompt, good-faith effort to correct the situation and by notification of\nsupervisor.\nApplicant\u2019s decision to erase information from the company\u2019s main computer\nsystem was deliberate and intentional, not inadvertent or unintentional. His actions were\nnot for the company\u2019s efficiency or effectiveness, but appear to be the result of his\nanger and frustration with the company. While this incident took place more than seven\nyears ago, given his computer skills and expertise, I have concerns that he could act in\na similar manner in the future if he were angry and frustrated with an employer. He has\nnot mitigated the security concerns raised by the Government.\nGuideline K: Handling Protection Information\nAG \u00b6 33 expresses the security concern pertaining to handling protected\ninformation, \u201cDeliberate or negligent failure to comply with rules and regulations for\nprotecting classified or other sensitive information raises doubt about an individual's\ntrustworthiness, judgment, reliability, or willingness and ability to safeguard such\ninformation, and is a serious security concern.\u201d\nAG \u00b6 34 describes the disqualifying conditions that could raise security concerns.\nI have considered all the conditions, and especially the following:\n(g) any failure to comply with rules for the protection of classified or other\nsensitive information.\nWhen he resigned his position in 2003, Applicant modified the company\u2019s main\ncomputer system by erasing much of his work product from the company\u2019s main\ncomputer system. The information deleted from the company\u2019s main computer system\nwas not haphazard or all information, but selectively chosen information and related to\nApplicant\u2019s work for the company. Applicant\u2019s actions are a violation of the company\u2019s\npolicies and general workplace rules governing work products which are the proprietary\ninformation of the company. The Government has established a prima facie case under\nGuideline K. \nAG \u00b6 35 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the behavior, or it has happened so\ninfrequently or under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;\n(b) the individual responded favorably to counseling or remedial security\ntraining and now demonstrates a positive attitude toward the discharge of\nsecurity responsibilities; and\n\n14\n(c) the security violations were due to improper or inadequate training.\nWhile it has been seven years since Applicant deleted the company\u2019s proprietary\ninformation connected to his work product, his decision to do so continues to raise\nconcerns that he could act in a similar manner in the future, if he is angry or frustrated\nwith an employer. I recognize that he has handled classified information in the past\nwithout incident and since he left the employ of the company in 2003. This positive\nconduct is insufficient to overcome the concerns I have. He has not mitigated the\nGovernment\u2019s security concerns under Guideline K.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the\nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. The decision to grant or\ndeny a security clearance requires a careful weighing of all relevant factors, both\nfavorable and unfavorable. In so doing, an administrative judge must review all the\nevidence of record, not a single item in isolation, to determine if a security concern is\nestablished and then whether it is mitigated. A determination of an applicant\u2019s eligibility\nfor a security clearance should not be made as punishment for specific past conduct,\nbut on a reasonable and careful evaluation of all the evidence of record to decide if a\nnexus exists between established facts and a legitimate security concern. \nIn reaching a conclusion, I considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  After his\narrest in 1986, Applicant stayed away from conduct which involved criminal matters. He\nsuccessfully served in the United States military for seven years, then developed a\nsuccessful career in communications. His employer highly respects his work skills and\nrates his performance highly. During his civilian service near the Iraq war zone, he\nreceived several awards and letters for his work. The military also thought highly of his\nwork. He has never violated the procedures for handling classified information.\n\n15\nSeven years ago, Applicant abruptly ended his employment with the company\nafter their working relationship deteriorated. When he left his job, he deliberately\naccessed the company\u2019s main computer server and deleted proprietary information\nrelated to the work he had performed. This conduct was a serious breach of his\nresponsibilities as an employee and appears to have been done in anger and\nfrustration. He clearly did not want his employer to have access to his work. This\nconduct raises serious concerns about his judgment and trustworthiness. A concern\ncontinues as to what he might do in a similar situation in the future, especially since he\nhas not taken responsibility for his conduct. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his misuse of\ninformation technoloy and handling of protected information under Guidelines M and K\nand his personal conduct under Guideline E.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline M:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline K:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n16\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                                              \nMARY E. HENRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn January 14, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guidelines F. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 17, 2009, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on March 9, \n2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on March 19, 2009, and I convened the hearing \nas scheduled on April 13, 2009. Department Counsel offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5. \nApplicant did not object and they were admitted. Applicant and one witness testified. \n \n1 \n \n \nApril 24, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nApplicant offered Exhibits (AE) A through F. Department Counsel did not object and \nthey were admitted. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on April 22, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admissions to all of the allegations in the SOR are incorporated herein. \nIn addition, after a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nI make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 32-year-old single mother of three children, ages 13, 6 and 4. She \nhas a high school diploma and has earned approximately 15 college credits. She has \nworked for her present employer, a federal contractor, as a document management \nspecialist, since November 2006. Approximately a year ago she received a pay \nincrease. She receives no child support from the father of her 13 year old because he is \nin jail. She receives sporadic child support from the father of her other two children, but \nhe spent last year in jail for failing to pay child support for a different child.1  \n \n \nApplicant was unemployed from April 2006 to October 2006. She also \nexperienced a period of unemployment in 2002 to 2003 when she was working for a \ngovernment contractor and they lost the contract. It is not known how many months she \nwas unemployed. From 1999 to 2004 she first worked in a temporary position for her \nemployer before she was hired in a permanent position.2 \n \n \nAppellant has had difficulty paying her financial obligations because of the lack of \nconsistent child support payments and the periods of unemployment. She stated she is \nalways falling behind in her payments because it is hard to take care of her family and \nexpenses and she was not making enough money to adequately do both. For a period \nof time the father of her two younger children lived with her and helped with the \nexpenses. He lost his job and she supported him for a period of time. Sometimes her \nparents and family members help her financially.3 \n \n \nAppellant has approximately $18,170 in delinquent debt she has accumulated \nsince as early as 2001. On February 27, 2009, she entered into a debt management \nagreement and consolidated certain delinquent debts. She originally was to pay $243 a \nmonth in the plan, but the amount was modified to $333 a month beginning with her \nApril 2009 payment. She stated she made one payment of $243 in March 2009 on this \nplan.4 The information below describes which creditors are and are not included in this \nplan. \n \n \n1 Tr. 29-37. \n \n2 Tr. 39-45; AE E. \n \n3 Tr. 37-38, 45-49. \n \n4 Tr. 50-53; AE A. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a is a credit card debt ($1,506) that is in collection and has \nnot been paid in a couple of years. This debt is included in the debt management plan.5 \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b is a credit card debt ($437). The account is closed and is \nnot included in the debt management plan. Applicant stated she has a separate \narrangement with the creditor and is paying $50 a month on the debt. She stated that \nshe made her first payment in March 2009, but did not provide any documented proof of \nher payment.6  \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c ($825) is for on-line classes Applicant took through a \nuniversity. She participated in the classes in March 2008. She has not made any \npayments toward this debt, but stated she planned on paying the debt. She stated she \nwill pay $50 a payday toward repayment. It is not included in her debt management \nplan.7 \n \n \nThe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.f are credit card debts ($1,035, $727). Applicant \nstated that she has not made any payments on these debts in a couple of years \nbecause she did not make enough money. She has included these two debts in her \ndebt management plan.8  \n \n \nThe debt in SOR 1.e is a store credit card ($550). The account closed last year \nand this debt is included in Applicant\u2019s debt management plan.9 \n \n \nThe debt in SOR \u00b6 1.g is a debt incurred for on-line classes ($4,204) that \nApplicant took approximately four years ago. She did not finish the courses because \nshe started a job. She made a couple small payments of $30, but did not recall how \nmany.

Not included in her budget were any of the payments she stated she \nwas making outside of the plan or any of the payments she stated she intended to start \nmaking.19  \n \n \nApplicant was asked if she pays her taxes on time and she stated she did and \nreceived a refund of $3,000 to $4,000 from the federal government. Some of this money \nwas involuntarily garnished due to an overpayment in foot stamp benefits she received. \nShe was entitled to a state refund of approximately $1,500, but it was also garnished. \nShe was unable to explain why the state garnished her refund. After the garnishment \nshe received about $3,000 from her federal tax refund. She used this money to pay bills \nand to repay outstanding personal loans and take care of needed repairs on her home. \nHer home is owned by her parents and she pays them rent. She stated she fixes things \nin the home because she plans on buying it.20  \n \n \nApplicant stated she intends on paying all of her outstanding debts. This \nprocedure has been a \u201cwake up\u201d call to her. Due to her low income she has not been \nable to pay her bills, but her family was her top priority. She believes given an \nopportunity to prove herself she can show she is trustworthy and can correct her past \nproblems. She has not sought or received any financial counseling.21 \n \n \nA coworker of Applicant\u2019s testified on her behalf. She has observed Applicant \nadvance in her job and that she was entrusted with more responsibility. She believes \nApplicant has a strong work ethic and is reliable. She does not believe Applicant lives \nbeyond her means. She does not socialize with Applicant outside of work.22  \n \n \nI have considered all of the character statements provided by Applicant. Those \nproviding statements consider Applicant to be conscientious to her children, family, \nfriends and coworkers. She does whatever is necessary to get the job done. She is \ntrusted by her employer. She is considered dedicated and reliable. She demonstrates \nhonesty, teamwork and a willingness to learn new tasks. Applicant is considered loyal \nand devoted and is highly respected. She is trusted in matters of national security.23 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \n \n19 Tr. 90-95, 103-106. \n \n20 Tr. 95-102. \n \n21 Tr. 102. \n \n22 Tr. 19-28. \n \n23 AE B. \n\n \n6 \n \n \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them and especially considered the following under AG & 19: \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;  \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and  \n \n(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be indicated by \nexcessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ration, and/or other financial analysis \n \nApplicant had numerous delinquent debts that have remained unpaid for years. \nShe recently set up a payment plan for some of the debts, however it appears based on \nher budget that it will be difficult for her to realistically maintain the plan. Not all of her \ndebts are included in the payment plan. She stated she is making payments on some \nother debts, but they were not in her budget. Despite Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties she \nincurred significant debts with four on-line educational programs, dating as far back as \n2001. She would incur new debts for on-line courses when she had not made any effort \nto pay the ones she already had. I find all of the above disqualifying conditions have \nbeen raised.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions and especially considered the following under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control, and \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior is recent because she has delinquent debts that remain \nunpaid and are not included in her payment plan. It does not appear that with the \nbudget she presented that the plan will likely be successful. Applicant did not take any \naction on her delinquent debts until her security clearance became an issue. I find her \nconduct casts doubt on her reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment and therefore \n(a) does not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant has had financial problems for a significant amount of time. Some of it \nis attributable to not receiving consistent child support and periods of unemployment. \nThese were conditions that were beyond her control. Applicant has been working \nsteadily since November 2006 and last year received a pay raise. She did not take any \naction on the delinquent debts raised in the SOR until last month when she entered a \ndebt management program. She has made only one payment. Applicant incurred \napproximately $9,945 in debts for on-line classes that she could not afford. She took the \nclasses and never paid for them. She was aware of her limited income and inability to \npay her bills, yet she incurred these additional expenses. She continued to incur new \ndebts for on-line courses when she had not repaid any of the previous debts. Seeking to \nexpand her opportunities through education is a positive step. However, neglecting to \nreimburse those institutions providing the education is not acting responsibly. Therefore, \nI find that mitigating condition (b) only partially applies.  \n \n \nApplicant is now participating in a debt management program and is paying \nsome of her delinquent debts. It is too early to determine whether based on her budget \nshe will be able to maintain the payments required of this plan. She also has other debts \nthat she stated she is either paying or intends to start paying, but failed to provide \ndocumentation of her efforts. In addition, these prospective payments were not included \nin her budget and therefore it is unclear how they will be maintained. Applicant has not \nhad any financial counseling. Under the facts presented and the circumstances of this \ncase, I do not find there are clear indications the problem is being resolved; is under \ncontrol; or that there are good faith efforts to resolve all of her debts. Therefore, I find \nmitigating conditions (c) and (d) do not apply.  \n \n \n \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a single mother with \nthree children she supports. Those whom she works with provided praise for her work. \nShe has had periods of underemployment and unemployment. However, she has been \nemployed since 2006 and received a pay raise in the last year. Although some of her \ndebts may be for living expenses, she has incurred approximately $9,945 in debts for \neducational courses she took and never paid for. Despite knowing she had not paid for \none course, she took others and again did not pay for them. She did not attempt to pay \nher delinquent debts on the SOR until her security clearance became an issue. Based \non the budget she provided it appears unlikely she will be able to maintain the payment \nplan she has agreed to. She has made only one payment into the plan. She does not \nhave a consistent history of regular payments into this plan and therefore it is too early \nto conclude she is committed to reducing her delinquent debt. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns arising from financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.p: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly in the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

McGillin, Jr., Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMALONE, Matthew E., Administrative Judge:\nBased upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance is denied.\nOn February 21, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for\nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to retain a security clearance required for his job with\na defense contractor. After reviewing the results of the ensuing background\ninvestigation, adjudicators for the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued to Applicant a set of interrogatories  regarding information in his background.\n1\nBased on the results of the background investigation and his response to the\ninterrogatories, DOHA adjudicators were unable to make a preliminary affirmative\nfinding  that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s\n2\nJuly 29, 2009\n\n The revised Adjudicative Guidelines were approved by the President on December 29, 2005, and were\n3\nimplemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending official revision of the Directive,\nthey supercede the guidelines listed in Enclosure 2 to the Directive.\n2\naccess to classified information. On January 30, 2009, DOHA issued to Applicant a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which, if proven, raise security concerns\naddressed in the revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under Guideline J (criminal\n3\nconduct), Guideline E (personal conduct), Guideline D (sexual behavior), and Guideline\nF (financial considerations).\nApplicant timely responded to the SOR and requested a hearing. The case was\nassigned to me on April 6, 2009. I convened a hearing on April 22, 2009, at which the\nparties appeared as scheduled. The government presented seven exhibits (Gx. 1 - 7),\nwhich were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and\nproffered seven exhibits (Ax. A - G), which were admitted without objection. DOHA\nreceived the transcript of hearing (Tr.) on May 11, 2009. \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline J, the government alleged in the SOR that Applicant was\narrested in October 2007 and charged with Unnatural and Lascivious Act and with\nExposure of a Sex Organ. It was further alleged that, in January 2008, the charges were\ndisposed of through a plea of nolo contendere to Disorderly Conduct, adjudication was\nwithheld on his plea, he was placed on probation for six months, and he was assessed\nfines and court costs. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) Under Guideline E, the government alleged in the\nSOR that Applicant did not tell his employer of his arrest. It was also alleged that he\ntried to conceal from his employer the details of his arrest and the charges against him.\n(SOR \u00b6 2.a) Under Guideline D, the government cross-alleged the conduct for which he\nwas arrested as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. Specifically, it was alleged that he exposed his\npenis and masturbated in public. (SOR \u00b6 3.a) Under Guideline F, the government\nalleged Applicant owes approximately $19,319 for four delinquent debts. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.a -\n4.d)\nApplicant admitted all of the facts presented in the SOR allegations. In addition to\nthe facts established through his admissions, and after reviewing the pleadings, the\ntranscript, and exhibits, I have made the following findings of relevant fact.\nApplicant is a 47-year-old senior engineering technician, who has been employed\nby the same defense contractor since September 2001. Prior to that, he had served for\n20 years in the U.S. Navy. In 2001, he retired with an honorable discharge as a First\nClass Petty Officer. (Gx. 1; Tr., 21) Applicant\u2019s permanent job site is in another state\nthan where he has lived since April 2007. \nSince about 1986, Applicant has had a roommate who, more recently, has had\nmedical issues that prevent the roommate from working. Applicant has supported his\nroommate financially and medically while they have lived at Applicant\u2019s TDY location.\nWhen they return to Applicant\u2019s permanent residence, the roommate will again have\n\n3\naccess to his state medical benefits, thus easing Applicant\u2019s financial burden. (Gx. 2;\nTr., 76 - 79)\nOn October 5, 2007, Applicant and his roommate, who had been drinking that\nmorning, got into an argument. When Applicant left the house, he decided to go to a\nnearby public park to relax. While there, Applicant was approached by a man who\nengaged him in conversation and walked with him down some of the park trails. At\nsome point during their walk, Applicant reached into his own pants and started to\nmasturbate. When Applicant exposed his penis, the other man identified himself as an\nundercover police officer who was recording Applicant\u2019s conduct with a hidden video\ncamera. Applicant was arrested and charged with committing an Unnatural and\nLascivious Act and with Exposure of a Sex Organ, both misdemeanor offenses. (Gx. 2 -\n6; Tr., 22, 23 - 31)\nAs part of a plea bargain, Applicant pleaded nolo contendere to disorderly\nconduct, but adjudication was withheld pending successful completion of six months\nprobation. Applicant was also ordered to undergo a psycho-sexual evaluation, which he\ndid on February 5, 2008. The evaluation did not yield a clinical diagnosis, and the\nLicensed Mental Health Counselor who conducted the evaluation concluded that\nApplicant \u201cis not at risk for future sex offending behaviors\u201d and that he does not require\n\u201cany mental health treatment for such behaviors or any other mental health problems.\u201d\n(Ax. A) On May 23, 2008, Applicant successfully completed his probation. However, by\norder of the sheriff\u2019s department of the county where he was arrested, he is\npermanently barred from entering any of that county\u2019s public parks. (Gx. 2; Gx. 3; Tr.,\n72)\nApplicant was interviewed for his clearance by a government investigator in April\n2008. The summary of that interview (Gx. 2) represents that Applicant \u201chired an attorney\nin an effort to prevent his employer from learning of the incident and the arrest, and in\nessence, to save his job.\u201d Applicant denied that he said this during the interview\n(Tr.,69), but he also testified that he was too embarrassed by his conduct to discuss the\ndetails of his arrest with the investigator. (Tr., 35)\nApplicant has not yet disclosed the original charges to his employer despite being\naware that he was obligated to do so. Three months after his arrest, he disclosed in his\ne-QIP that he was charged with disorderly conduct. Applicant waited until after the\ncharges had been disposed of through the court system before he told his supervisor\nthat he had been arrested, but, to date, he has only disclosed that he was arrested for\ndisorderly conduct and has not disclosed to his company the details of his conduct.\nApplicant interpreted his e-QIP disclosure as fulfilling his obligation to tell inform\nemployer. But he has acknowledged that this interpretation was erroneous and that it\nwas the product of his embarrassment about his conduct. (Tr., 93 - 94) Applicant has\nfurther acknowledged that he was concerned he would be fired if his employer knew the\ndetails of what happened. The fact of his arrest and his identity were made public in\nnewspaper stories and television news reports around the time he was arrested. (Gx. 1;\nGx. 2; Tr., 32 - 34, 41, 68 - 70)\n\n4\nTwo of Applicant\u2019s work associates submitted letters of support and\nrecommendation for him. (Ax. D and E) Both authors praise Applicant\u2019s character and\ntrustworthiness, with emphasis by both on his generosity and professionalism. One of\nthe associates expressed knowledge of the fact that Applicant experienced financial\nproblems, but insisted that these resulted not from irresponsibility but from his efforts to\nhelp others. Neither associate indicated any expressed or implied knowledge of\nApplicant\u2019s arrest, or the details thereof. \nIn 1996, Applicant\u2019s mother died. However, before she passed away, she\nexecuted a quitclaim deed which transferred ownership of her house to Applicant and\nhis brother. As Applicant was serving in the Navy at the time, he agreed that his brother\nand some friends who would pay rent could occupy the house. His brother died in 2001\nafter having been fully supported by Applicant for about two years. Thereafter, Applicant\nallowed the friends to stay in the house as tenants. Unfortunately, they did not pay rent\nas agreed and, over time, caused a great deal of damage to the house. Applicant had\nthe tenants evicted and spent about $45,000 to repair the house so he could sell it.\nHowever, he could not sell the house because his late brother had adult children who\nbased a claim of ownership of the house on a defect in the quitclaim deed. Applicant\neventually received about $7,500 as a settlement in which he forfeited his interest in the\nhouse. (Gx. 2; Tr. 43 - 47) \nWhile Applicant was trying to salvage his mother\u2019s house for sale, he was also\nmaintaining another residence near his Navy duty station. He sold that house and used\nthe proceeds to help pay for the repairs to his mother\u2019s house. Nonetheless, he\ngradually fell behind on a number of personal credit accounts. (Tr. 47 - 52) As alleged in\nthe SOR, he became delinquent on four debts totaling $19,319. One debt was for an\nAmerican Express credit card, for which he owed $1,684. (Gx. 7) After making minimal\npayments to that debt since October 2008, Applicant paid $842.03 in March 2009 to\nsettle the debt. (Ax. F) Another debt was for a delinquent cable television account, for\nwhich he owed $370. The account went unpaid when Applicant moved after selling his\nhouse. As of December 2008, it was paid in full. (Ax. G) In March 2009, Applicant also\nsettled in full a $5,113 delinquent account with a large hardware chain store. Applicant\u2019s\nlargest delinquent debt was for a line of credit totaling $12,403. (Gx. 7) With interest and\nfees, this account, which has been referred to a collection agency, now totals about\n$13,953. (Ax. B) Applicant has been in communication with this creditor and, after\npaying $25 each month through the end of 2008, he has been paying $100 each month,\nand he hopes to increase that payment to $300 when he finishes paying other\nobligations. (Gx. 2; Ax. B; Tr. 51 - 52)\nIn 1987, Applicant had just re-enlisted in the Navy as a Second Class Petty\nOfficer. He spent his bonus on a $22,000 sports car, but it was soon damaged in a car\naccident. His insurance company would not declare the car a total loss and the policy\ndid not pay enough to properly repair it. Applicant incurred costs of trying to repair the\ncar and, eventually, buying another car. As he found himself unable to meet his\nobligations, he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy and his debts were discharged. (Gx. 2; Tr.\n60 - 62)\n\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n4\n Directive. 6.3.\n5\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n5\nIn April 2009, Applicant began using a financial counseling service. According to\nthe budget he established in conjunction with that service, it appears he has about\n$2,700 remaining each month after paying expenses. From that, he is currently paying\n$735 to four other credit card accounts (all current) and the aforementioned line of\ncredit. (Ax. B)\nPolicies\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n4\nhave access to classified information. Each decision must be a fair, impartial, and\ncommonsense determination based on examination of all available relevant and\nmaterial information,  and consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policies\n5\nin the revised Adjudicative Guidelines. Decisions must also reflect consideration of the\nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole\nperson\u201d concept, those factors are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not, by itself,\nconclusive. However, specific applicable guidelines should be followed whenever a case\ncan be measured against them as they represent policy guidance governing the grant or\ndenial of access to classified information. In this case, the pleadings and the information\npresented by the parties require consideration of the security concerns and adjudicative\nfactors addressed under AG \u00b6 12 (Guideline D - Sexual Behavior), AG \u00b6 15 (Guideline\nE - Personal Conduct), AG \u00b6 18 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations), and AG \u00b6 30\n(Guideline J - Criminal Conduct).\nThe government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on\nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an\napplicant. Additionally, the government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute,\nextenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security\nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion.  A person who has access\n6\nto classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship with the government based\n\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n6\non trust and confidence. Thus, the government has a compelling interest in ensuring\neach applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one\nwho will protect the national interests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.7\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations.\nThe government presented sufficient information to support the allegations in\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 4.a - 4.d. The facts thus established show that Applicant owed approximately\n$19,319 in unpaid debts dating back to at least 2001. The resulting security concern\nabout Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that \n[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe record as it pertains to Applicant\u2019s finances requires application of the\ndisqualifying conditions listed at AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts)\nand AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations). By contrast, as to SOR\n\u00b6\u00b6 4.a, 4.c, and 4.d, Applicant showed he has paid or otherwise resolved those debts.\nHe also showed he is making payments to his largest creditor (SOR \u00b6 4.b) and appears\nto have sufficient financial resources to continue resolving his financial problems with\nthe help of a financial counselor. \nFurther, the debts he incurred stemmed from unforeseen circumstances\nsurrounding the disposition of his late mother\u2019s house. Had he been able to sell the\nhouse as he intended, he likely would have been able to pay off or stay current on the\ndebts he incurred as he tried to salvage the value of the house. In response to those\ncircumstances, Applicant has paid or resolved all but one of his delinquencies, and his\ncurrent finances appear to be sound as he has a significant positive monthly cash flow.\nAvailable information supports application of the mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6 20(b) (the\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person's\ncontrol (e.g. loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency,\nor a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances), AG \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the\nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under\ncontrol), and AG \u00b6 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts). On balance, Applicant\u2019s information is sufficient to\nmitigate the Guideline F security concerns established by this record. \n\n7\nCriminal Conduct. \nThe government presented sufficient reliable information to support the allegation\nof criminal conduct in SOR \u00b6 1.a. It is uncontroverted that Applicant engaged in illegal\nsexual conduct in front of an undercover police officer and that he pleaded no contest to\na lesser charge. He was sentenced to probation and ordered to undergo a psycho-\nsexual evaluation. He is also permanently barred from entering any public park in the\ncounty where the offense occurred. The resulting security concern about Applicant\u2019s\ncriminal conduct, as stated in AG \u00b6 30, is that \u201c[c]riminal activity creates doubt about a\nperson's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into\nquestion a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d\nThe established facts pertaining to Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct require application of\nthe disqualifying conditions at AG \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser\noffenses) and AG \u00b6 31(c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of\nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted). \nI have also considered the potential applicability to these facts of the mitigating\nconditions listed under AG \u00b6 32. Applicant successfully completed all of the terms of his\nprobation, has been gainfully employed before and after his arrest, appears sincerely\nremorseful of his conduct, and the psycho-sexual evaluation he was given showed no\nrisk that this behavior would repeat. Aside from an arrest in 1987 for driving under the\ninfluence of alcohol (not alleged in the SOR), Applicant does not have a history of\ncriminal conduct. The mitigating conditions at AG \u00b6 32(a) (so much time has elapsed\nsince the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual's\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) and AG \u00b6 32(d) (there is evidence of\nsuccessful rehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without\nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education,\ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement) apply. On balance,\navailable information is sufficient to mitigate the security concerns about Applicant\u2019s\ncriminal conduct.\nSexual Behavior.\nThe same information that supported the allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a also supported\nthe allegation in SOR \u00b6 2.a; that is, that Applicant engaged in improper sexual behavior\nthat has raised a security concern addressed in AG 12 as follows: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense, indicates a personality or\nemotional disorder, reflects lack of judgment or discretion, or which may\nsubject the individual to undue influence or coercion, exploitation, or\nduress can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness\nand ability to protect classified information. No adverse inference\nconcerning the standards in the Guideline may be raised solely on the\nbasis of the sexual orientation of the individual.\n\n8\nApplicant\u2019s conduct in this regard was public, and it exhibited a significant lack of\njudgment. His conduct continues to influence him in that he is, by his own admission,\nvery embarrassed and was reluctant to discuss the details of his arrest with a\ngovernment investigator during his subject interview. The facts established by the\ngovernment\u2019s information and by Applicant\u2019s admissions and testimony require\napplication of the disqualifying conditions at AG \u00b6 13 (a) (sexual behavior of a criminal\nnature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted), AG \u00b6 13(c) (sexual behavior\nthat causes an individual to be vulnerable to coercion, exploitation, or duress), and AG \u00b6\n13(d) (sexual behavior of a public nature and/or that which reflects lack of discretion or\njudgment).\nOf the mitigating conditions listed under Guideline D, only AG \u00b6 14(b) (the sexual\nbehavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or under such unusual circumstances,\nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment) (emphasis added) is potentially applicable. This was\nan infrequent act that, arguably, occurred under unusual circumstances. Further, the\npsycho-sexual evaluation indicates that it is unlikely Applicant will engage in this sort of\nbehavior in the future. However, Applicant remains embarrassed by the details of his\nconduct, if not by the fact that he was arrested. He acknowledged that he remains\nconcerned that he will lose his job if his employer learns the details of his conduct, and it\nappears he has not divulged the facts of what happened even to his associates who\nsubmitted references in his behalf. \nIn short, Applicant\u2019s behavior, candor and judgment have been adversely\naffected by his embarrassment over his sexual behavior. These circumstances also\nraise the distinct possibility that he could be manipulated or coerced into acting so as to\nharm the national interest. For these reasons, I conclude that AG \u00b6 14(b) does not apply\nand that the totality of the information bearing on this issue shows that Applicant has not\nmitigated the security concerns about his sexual behavior. \nPersonal Conduct. \nThe government\u2019s information is also sufficient to support the allegation in SOR \u00b6\n2.a. Certainly, the conduct that lead to his arrest reflects poorly on Applicant\u2019s judgment.\nAdditionally, he was embarrassed by and reluctant to discuss with the investigating\nagent the details of his behavior. While he denies that he hired an attorney to keep his\nemployer from learning of his conduct and arrest, he acknowledges that he waited until\nafter the judicial disposition of the original charges before he advised his employer of\nthe adverse information or completed his e-QIP. It is clear from all of the information\nbearing on this issue that he has still not divulged this information when required.\nFurther, Applicant was less than candid on his e-QIP when he listed his arrest as a\ndisorderly conduct charge rather than the original two misdemeanor sex offenses for\nwhich he was initially charged. It is also clear that Applicant remains concerned about\nthe possible adverse effects on his employment that might arise if his employer learns\nthe whole story behind his arrest. \n\n9\nThe facts established by the government\u2019s information and by Applicant\u2019s\ntestimony raise security concerns about his personal conduct, as expressed at AG \u00b6 15,\nas follows:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nMore specifically, available information requires application of the disqualifying\nconditions at AG \u00b6 16(a) (deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant\nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar\nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities), and AG \u00b6 16(e) (personal conduct or concealment of\ninformation about one's conduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if known, may affect\nthe person's personal, professional, or community standing,...). \nOf the mitigating conditions listed at AG \u00b6 17, only AG \u00b6 17(c) (the offense is so\nminor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened\nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on\nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) and AG \u00b6 17(e) (the\nindividual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation,\nmanipulation, or duress) are potentially applicable. However, I decline to apply either.\nAs to AG \u00b6 17(c), the underlying conduct that led to his arrest was isolated and not likely\nto recur. But his embarrassment continues to cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s judgment and\nadversely affect his candor and trustworthiness when dealing with his employer.\nConcurrently, in considering AG \u00b6 17(e), I conclude that Applicant has not done\nanything to reduce the potential for use of these circumstances for exploitation or\ncoercion against him. On balance, Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns\nabout his personal conduct and judgment.\nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guidelines D, E, F, and J. I have also reviewed the record\nbefore me in the context of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 47\nyears old and presumed to be a mature adult. He served his country honorably for most\nof his adult life, and he has exhibited a laudable measure of generosity (often to his own\ndetriment) in dealing with his friends and family. He acted responsibly in trying to\nresolve his financial problems, and he enjoys a good reputation among his co-workers.\nHowever, that reputation is rendered suspect by the conduct that led to his arrest and\nby his continued reluctance to disclose relevant information in his background when\nrequired. At the very least, his apparent failure to tell two associates who submitted\npositive recommendations for the record indicates an ongoing risk of coercion and\n\n See footnote 5, supra.\n8\n See footnote 8, supra. \n9\n10\nexploitation. A fair and commonsense assessment  of all available information bearing\n8\non Applicant\u2019s finances and truthfulness shows he has failed to address satisfactorily\nthe government\u2019s doubts about his ability or willingness to protect the government\u2019s\ninterests as his own. Because protection of the national interest is paramount in these\ndeterminations, such doubts must be resolved in favor of the government.  \n9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline D:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 4, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 4.a - 4.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto continue Applicant\u2019s access to classified information.

Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \nOn January 22, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations and Guideline E, Personal Conduct. The action \nwas taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the \nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for \nSORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 19, 2009, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to another administrative judge \non March 25, 2009. Applicant works and lives overseas. DOHA issued a notice of \nhearing on April 7, 2009, scheduling the hearing for May 18, 2009, by video \nJune 9, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \nteleconference (VTC). The case was reassigned to me on April 16, 2009. The hearing \nwas convened as scheduled. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 8, which \nwere received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and submitted \nExhibits (AE) A through F, which were received without objection. The record was held \nopen for Applicant to submit additional information. Applicant submitted two sets of \ndocuments, which were marked AE G through M, and admitted without objection. \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s memorandums are marked Hearing Exhibits (HE) I and II. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on May 28, 2009.  \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR by deleting from SOR \u00b6 2.b, the \nlanguage: \u201cb.

He was unemployed from about November \n2006 through March 2007. He worked as a realtor from March 2007 through August \n2007. He stated that he worked on commission but never sold a property. He has \nworked for his current employer since about August 2007, but in three different \nlocations. He worked initially for the company in a different geographic region than his \nfamily. He then worked in his home city. He is now working overseas. With his \nunemployment, underemployment and living in different locations than his family, his \nfinances started to suffer. He did not pay sufficient attention to his finances and had \nnever checked his credit report.

Specific debts are addressed below. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges a judgment of $1,361, plus court costs and interest, entered \nagainst Applicant on behalf of a collection company in March 2007. Applicant was \nunaware that a judgment was entered against him. The judgment, which totaled $1,872 \nwith court costs and interest, was paid in full in April 2008.4 \n \n \nA credit card company obtained a default judgment of $1,173, plus court costs, \nfees, and interest, against Applicant in May 2008, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. Applicant \nwas also unaware of this judgment. He paid the judgment, which totaled $2,099 with \ncourt costs, fees, and interest, in full in May 2009.5 \n \n \nIn May 2009, Applicant paid the delinquent debt of $312 to a collection company, \non behalf of a telephone services company, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d.6 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.f allege delinquent debts of $1,853 and $2,884 owed to the \nsame credit card company that obtained the judgment against Applicant alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.c. Both debts are listed on an October 29, 2008 credit report. Applicant credibly \ntestified that he believed the $1,853 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e and the $2,884 debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f were the underlying debts that resulted in the judgments alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c. The credit report of May 12, 2009, reports that the $1,853 debt was \ntransferred to another lender. The collection company that was the plaintiff in the suit is \nnot listed on any of the credit reports in evidence. The plaintiffs in the two lawsuits have \naddresses in two states other than where the judgments were obtained, but they were \nboth represented by the same law firm. That same law firm wrote a letter to Applicant on \nFebruary 13, 2009, stating that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f, with a balance at that time \nof $2,348, could be settled with payments of $880 on February 23, 2009 and March 23, \n2009. After the hearing, Applicant indicated that after further research, he discovered \nthat the $1,853 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e was transferred to a collection company in \nMay 2009. He made arrangements with the company to pay the debt by payments. \nAfter considering all the evidence, I find that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f is the \nunderlying debt that resulted in the judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. I further find that \nuntil recently Applicant honestly believed that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e was the \nunderlying debt that resulted in the judgment alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. When he discovered \nit was not the same debt, he made payment arrangements with the creditor.7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                           \n \n4 Tr. at 35, 39-42; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 7; AE G.  \n \n5 Tr. at 42-43; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 8; AE D.  \n \n6 Tr. at 43-44; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3-5; AE C, I.  \n \n7 Tr. at 42-51; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3-5, 7, 8; AE D, F-H, J. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.i allege delinquent debts of $1,257 and $681 owed to the \nsame collection company collecting on behalf of the same financial institution. Both \ndebts with different account numbers are listed on the February 21, 2008 credit report. \nThe $1,257 debt is listed by Experian on the October 29, 2008 combined credit report. It \nis not listed on the March 17, 2009 Equifax report or the May 12, 2009 combined credit \nreport. The $681 debt is not listed on any of the three most recent credit reports in \nevidence. Applicant contacted the collection company using the phone number listed on \none of the credit reports. He asked to pay all his debts they were collecting. He \nsubmitted documentation from the collection company that he paid a debt that they \nwere collecting. The document indicated that the original creditor was a university. \nApplicant credibly testified that he thought he paid the debts alleged in the SOR.8  \n \n \nApplicant has been making monthly payments of $124 toward the delinquent \ndebt of $1,303 to a university, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. He testified that he thought the \ndebt was paid in full. The May 12, 2009 credit report listed the balance as $248. His \nbank statements show $124 payments consistently posted to his account on the 10th or \nthe 11th of the month. The last $124 payment posted to his account on May 11, 2009.9   \n \n \nApplicant disputed the $144 debt to a collection company on behalf of a cable \ntelevision provider, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j. He stated that the company billed him for a \nperiod when there was no cable television provided to anybody in the area in the \naftermath of a natural disaster. He contacted the cable company and the company \nagreed that he should not have been billed for that period. The debt has been removed \nfrom his credit report.10   \n \n \nIn February 2009, Applicant paid the $25 delinquent debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k \nand the $100 delinquent debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.l.11   \n \n \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) \nwhich he certified as true on February 7, 2008. He answered \u201cNo\u201d to Questions 27d and \n28a, which asked \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you had any judgments against you that \nhave not been paid?\u201d and \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been over 180 days delinquent \non any debt(s)?\u201d He answered \u201cYes\u201d to Question 28b, which asked \u201cAre you currently \nover 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\u201d He listed a delinquent student loan of $2,100 \nto the university named in SOR \u00b6 1.h. He also added \u201c[w]orking with legal agency to \nclean up and pay outstanding debts.\u201d Applicant denied intentionally falsifying the SF 86. \nHe was unaware of the judgments and was not completely aware of his financial \nsituation at the time he submitted the SF 86. He also admitted that he did not pay as \nmuch attention to the questionnaire as he should have. Applicant provided potentially \nembarrassing information unrelated to his finances in response to other questions on \n                                                          \n8 Tr. at 51-61; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3-5; AE E, F. \n \n9 Tr. at 58; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3-5; AE F, J, K. \n \n10 Tr. at 61-62; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3-5; AE F. \n \n11 Tr. at 62-63; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 3-5; AE F, K-M. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nthe SF 86.12 After considering all the evidence, I find that Applicant did not intentionally \nfalsify his SF 86.  \n \n \nApplicant was unaware of how bad his finances had become until the \nbackground investigator confronted him with his credit report. He realized that he did not \npay sufficient attention to his finances. He has not received formal financial counseling, \nbut he has taken steps to stay on top of his finances. He now has an account with a \ncompany that provides him a credit report on a monthly basis. He is determined to \nresolve any remaining delinquent debts and more closely monitor his finances. \nApplicant\u2019s current financial situation is stable. He earns a good salary; has his military \nretirement; and his wife works. Their youngest child still lives at home with his wife, but \ntheir oldest child is on her own. He does not have a lavish lifestyle and has more than \nenough income to stay financially solvent.13 \n \n \nApplicant submitted two character letters. His commanding officer at his last duty \nstation wrote a very strong letter on his behalf, as did the individual who supervised him \nbefore he went overseas in September 2008. His former commanding officer wrote that \n\u201c[Applicant\u2019s] dedication to duty, reliability and commitment to the Navy, the nation and \nhis Sailors was unsurpassed.\u201d His former supervisor, a retired senior military officer, \nwrote that Applicant is very conscientious, highly capable, exceptionally reliable, and \u201cof \nexemplary character and unquestionably trustworthy.\u201d Both individuals highly \nrecommend Applicant for a security clearance.14  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n                                                          \n12 Tr. at 28, 35, 63-64; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 1. \n \n13 Tr. at 64-65, 74-77. \n \n14 AE A, B. \n \n\n \n6 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling \nto pay his obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant had periods of unemployment after he retired from the Navy. His \nventure into real estate was an unqualified failure and he never sold a property. These \nqualify as conditions that were outside his control. To be fully applicable, AG \u00b6 20(b) \nalso requires that the individual act responsibly under the circumstances. Applicant \nadmitted that his unemployment and underemployment were only partly accountable for \nhis delinquent debts. He did not monitor his finances and did not begin to address his \ndelinquent debts until after the background investigator brought them to his attention. I \nfind that he did not act responsibly about his debts until after his finances became a \nsecurity concern. AG \u00b6 20(b) is partially applicable.  \n \n \nApplicant honestly thought he resolved all the debts alleged in the SOR. He paid \nthe two judgments against him and thought that resolved the two debts to the same \ncredit card company named as plaintiff in one of the judgments. The other judgment \nwas to a collection company. Applicant only realized after the hearing that there \n\n \n8 \n \napparently is still one delinquent debt owed to the credit card company. He has made \npayment arrangements to pay that debt. He called the phone number for the collection \ncompany collecting two of the listed debts. He paid what the company told him he owed. \nThe documentation appears to reflect that this was for a different account. The debts he \nthought he paid are no longer listed on his credit report. It is unclear who currently owns \nthese debts or their current status. I find that Applicant acted in good-faith to pay all his \ndelinquent debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) is applicable. His actions are too recent to warrant the \nbenefit of AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant has not received financial counseling, but his current \nfinancial situation is very stable. While his financial issues are not completely resolved, \nthere are clear indications that the problem is under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) is partially \napplicable.  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is applicable to the SOR \u00b6 1.f debt, because it is a duplicate of the \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. It is also applicable to the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct  \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following mitigating condition is potentially applicable:  \n \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities. \n \n \nApplicant omitted some financial information from his Questionnaire for National \nSecurity Positions; however, as discussed above, it was not a deliberate omission. AG \u00b6 \n16(a) is not applicable. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b are concluded for Applicant. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines F and E in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant served in the Navy for 22 years. His former commanding officer was very \nglowing in his praise of him. After he retired he had some periods of unemployment and \nunderemployment. He lived separately from his family on occasions due to the location \nof his work. Applicant admittedly did not pay as much attention to his finances as he \nshould have and debts became delinquent. The background investigator and the credit \nreport revealed how much he had let things slide. He has since been very proactive in \naddressing his finances. He has not completely resolved all his delinquent debts, but he \ncredibly testified that he plans to address all his delinquent debt. The Appeal Board has \nnoted that an applicant is not required to establish that he has paid every debt listed in \nthe SOR. All that is required is that an applicant must demonstrate that he has \n\u201cestablished a plan to resolve his financial problems and taken significant actions to \nimplement that plan.\u201d15 I find that Applicant has established a plan to resolve his \nfinancial problems and has taken significant action to implement that plan. His finances \ndo not constitute a security concern. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the Financial Considerations and Personal Conduct \nsecurity concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n15 ADP Case No. 06-18900 at 4 (App. Bd.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In her Answer to the SOR, the Applicant admitted the factual allegations in Subparagraph 1.a., of the SOR, with explanation. She denied the factual allegations in Subparagraphs 1.b. through 1.d. of the SOR. She also provided additional information to support her request for eligibility for a security clearance. Guideline F - Financial Considerations The Applicant \u201cwas medically retired from the Navy,\u201d in 1987, where she served for six years. (TR at page 17 line 13 to page 20 line 7, at page 44 line 20 to page 46 line 19, and GX 1 at pages 13~14.)

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: John N. Griffith, Esquire\nDecember 23, 2011\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCEFOLA, Richard A., Administrative Judge:\nThe Applicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations\nProcessing (e-QIP) on January 14, 2008.  On January 14, 2011, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline F for the Applicant.  The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), effective within the Department of\nDefense after September 1, 2006. \nThe Applicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on January 31, 2011.  She\nanswered the SOR in writing through counsel on February 7, 2011, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  DOHA received the request on June 3, 2011,\nand I received the case assignment on the same date.  DOHA issued a notice of\nhearing on June 6, 2011, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on June 30, 2011.\nThe Government offered Exhibits (GXs) 1 through 9, which were received without\n\n2\nobjection.  The Applicant testified on her own behalf, and submitted Exhibits (AppXs) A\nthrough L, which were received without objection.  DOHA received the transcript of the\nhearing (TR) on July 11, 2011.  I granted the Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record\nopen until July 29, 2011, to submit additional matters.  She submitted nothing further.\nThe record closed on July 29, 2011.  Based upon a review of the pleadings, exhibits,\nand testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, the Applicant admitted the factual allegations in\nSubparagraph 1.a., of the SOR, with explanation.  She denied the factual allegations in\nSubparagraphs 1.b. through 1.d. of the SOR.  She also provided additional information\nto support her request for eligibility for a security clearance.\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nThe Applicant \u201cwas medically retired from the Navy,\u201d in 1987, where she served\nfor six years.  (TR at page 17 line 13 to page 20 line 7, at page 44 line 20 to page 46\nline 19, and GX 1 at pages 13~14.)  She has addressed all of the alleged past due\ndebts, and has a positive monthly cash flow of over $1,000.  (TR at page 38 line 11 to\npage 41 line 1, and AppX G.)\n1.a.  It is alleged that the Applicant has a tax lien against her, in favor of the\nInternal Revenue Service, in the amount of about $38,559.  Between 2001 and 2005,\nthe Applicant \u201cwas a 1099 employee [self employed].\u201d  (TR at page 20 line 13 to page\n33 line 8, at page 39 line 16 to page 40 line 21, and at page 56 line 4 to page 65 line\n24.)  She filed income tax returns, but failed to pay her taxes.  At one point she owed as\nmuch as $42,000 to the IRS.  (Id.)  She has sought out professional services to pay\nback this lien, as evidenced by documentation by that tax relief service, and since 2006\nhas been making month payments of $500 towards the lien.  (AppXs A~C.)\n1.b.  It is alleged that the Applicant is indebted to Creditor B in the amount of\n$2,538.  The Applicant denies ever having a debt with this creditor, and it does not\nappear the Government\u2019s most recent June 2011 credit report (CR).  (TR at page 33\nline 9 to page 35 line 15, at page 50 line 11 to page 51 line 20, and GX 9.)  I find that\nthis is not the Applicant\u2019s debt.\n1.c.  It is alleged that the Applicant is indebted to Creditor C in the amount of $80.\nThe Applicant denies that this debt is past due; and on a recent 2011 CR, it is listed as\n\u201cpaid.\u201d  (TR at page 35 line 16 to page 36 line 10, at page 50 lines 3~10, and AppX C.)\n1.d.  Finally, it is alleged that the Applicant is indebted to Creditor D in the\namount of $461.  The Applicant again denies that this debt is past due; and on a recent\n2011 CR, it is listed as \u201cPAID ACCOUNT/ZERO BALANCE.\u201d  (TR at page 36 line 11 to\npage 38 line 10, at page 49 lines 5~16, and AppX D.)\n\n3\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG).  In addition to brief\nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially\ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.  Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process.  The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision.  According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d  The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.  AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d  In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record.  Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.  Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d  The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence.  This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours.  The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration\nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information.  Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d  See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\n\n4\nAnalysis\nGuideline F - Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in Paragraph 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns.  Under\nSubparagraph 19(a), an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially\ndisqualifying.  Similarly under Subparagraph 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial\nobligations@ may raise security concerns.  The Applicant had two past debts that have\nsince been paid, and has a significant tax lien.\nHowever, this is  countered by the fourth Mitigation Condition.  Subparagraph\n20(d) is applicable where \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d  She has paid all of her past due debts, except for\nthe tax lien towards which she is paying $500 each month.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.  Under Paragraph 2(c), the ultimate determination of\nwhether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person\nconcept.\nThe Administrative Judge should also consider the nine adjudicative process\nfactors listed at AG Paragraph 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\n5\nI considered all of the evidence, including the potentially disqualifying and\nmitigating conditions surrounding this case.  The Applicant is well respected in the work\nplace.  (AppXs H and I.)  The record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as\nto Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from her Financial\nConsiderations.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a.~1.f.\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n_________________\nRichard A. Cefola\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On May 28, 2009, DOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the\nbasis for that decision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On March 4, 2010, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Wilford H. Ross\ngranted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Department Counsel appealed pursuant to\nDirective \u00b6\u00b6  E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether certain of the Judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact were supported by substantial record evidence; whether the Judge erred in his\napplication of the Guideline F mitigating conditions; whether the Judge\u2019s whole-person analysis was\nin error; and whether the Judge erred by failing to amend the SOR to conform to the evidence\nadduced at the hearing.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge found that Applicant had numerous debts which had, for the most part, been paid\noff at the time of the hearing.  These debts included several tax liens filed against Applicant by both\nstate and federal authorities.  One large debt, approximately $106,000, had not been satisfied.  It was\nfor money Applicant received from Child Protective Services (CPS) on behalf of certain of his minor\nchildren.  This debt was, at the close of the record, being paid off pursuant to a court order.  The\nJudge found that Applicant was current on this debt and that there was no basis in the record to\nbelieve that Applicant had received the CPS payments improperly.  Applicant has stable employment\nand is current on all his debts.\nAlthough we acknowledge that there are ambiguities in the record concerning the\ncircumstances of Applicant\u2019s debt to CPS, after examining the Judge\u2019s material findings of security\nconcern we conclude that they are supported by substantial record evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case\nNo. 08-07528 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2009); ISCR Case No. 06-21025 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 9, 2007).\nDepartment Counsel argues that we should remand the case to the Judge with instructions to amend\nthe SOR in order to address concerns that Applicant received the CPS funds illegally.  A Judge is\nrequired to resolve all doubt in favor of national security.  Directive \u00b6 E2.2(b).  In an appropriate\ncase, this might entail amending the SOR to conform to the evidence adduced at a hearing.  See\nISCR Case 08-02404 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 5, 2009); Directive \u00b6 E3.1.17.  A Judge\u2019s decision\nregarding amending a SOR is reviewed for abuse of discretion.  ISCR Case No. 06-19544 at 3 (App.\nBd. May 28, 2008).  In the case under consideration here, the Judge made a sustainable finding that\nthe evidence was not sufficient to raise an issue of illegality underlying Applicant\u2019s receipt of CPS\nfunds.  Accordingly, we conclude that he did not err in failing to amend the SOR.  \nWe have examined the Judge\u2019s decision in light of the totality of the record evidence.  We\nconclude that the Judge\u2019s sustainable findings, summarized above, are sufficient to support a\nfavorable whole-person analysis.  Accordingly, we conclude that the Judge\u2019s decision is sustainable.\n\u201cThe Board need not agree with a Judge\u2019s decision in order to find it sustainable.\u201d  ISCR Case No.\n08-06856 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, 2010).  In light of this conclusion, we need not address the\nremaining issue concerning the Judge\u2019s analysis of the mitigating conditions. \n\n3\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s favorable security clearance decision is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jeffrey D.

On May 28, 2009, the Defense\nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to\nApplicant detailing the security concerns under Guideline F. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 8, 2009, and requested a hearing\nbefore an administrative judge.

The Government offered Government Exhibits 1 through 7, which\nwere received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, called one\nadditional witness, and submitted Applicant Exhibits A and B, also without objection.\nDOHA received the transcript of the hearing, and the record closed, on January 26,\n2010. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is 45, has a longtime companion, and nine children. He is employed by\na defense contractor and seeks to obtain a security clearance in connection with his\nemployment. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe Government alleges that Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he is\nfinancially overextended and therefore at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. Applicant denied all the allegations in the SOR, submitting evidence\nthat his financial situation is stable.\n1.a. Applicant paid this $250 medical debt in November 2009, as shown by a\nstatement from the creditor, and several credit reports. (Transcript at 45-48;\nGovernment Exhibit 2 at 9-11, and Exhibit 7 at 2; Applicant Exhibit B at 32.)\n1.b. A state tax lien was filed against Applicant in July 2003 in the amount of\n$4,894.  (Government Exhibit 3 at 6.) It was released in August 2009. (Transcript at 48-\n2\n50; Applicant Exhibit B at 34-35.) \n1.c. A state tax lien was filed against Applicant in October 2003 in the amount of\n$8,963.18. (Government Exhibit 3 at 3.) It was released in August 2009. (Transcript at\n49-50; Applicant Exhibit B at 36-37.)  \n1.d. A state tax lien was filed against Applicant in October 2007 in the amount of\n$4,848.30. (Government Exhibit 4 at 1.) It was released in June 2009. (Transcript at 51-\n53; Applicant Exhibit B at 38-39.) \n1.e. A Federal tax lien was filed against Applicant in March 2007 in the amount of\n$11,059.16. It was released in April 2009. (Transcript at 53-54; Applicant Exhibit B at\n40-41.) \nApplicant admitted that these tax liens were filed because he was delinquent in\nfiling his tax returns. According to the Applicant, due to his number of deductions, he\n\nIt is not alleged that the Applicant improperly received any of these welfare payments.\n3\n3\nusually does not have to pay any income tax. He further stated that he has now filed all\nof his tax returns. He further admitted that the failure to file timely tax returns was\nentirely his fault. (Transcript at 43-45, 81-92.)\n1.f. The debt alleged in this paragraph is the same debt as that in subparagraph\n1.a. (Transcript at 54-56.)\n1.g. This allegation was amended to read as follows, \u201cYou are indebted to\n[redacted] CO FDS on an account that is being paid by court order the approximate\nbalance of $106,707.22.\u201d (Transcript at 93-98.) \nThis debt is in relation to public support the Applicant\u2019s family received over ten\nyears ago. At that time, Applicant decided to change careers. In order to do this, he had\nto go to school full time. His companion does not work, so they found it necessary to file\nfor public support while he went to school. There is no allegation or evidence that this\nwas done improperly or illegally.\nOnce the Applicant attained his training, he immediately got a job with a\nsubstantial increase in pay and began paying the money back to the state authority. The\nreason for this recoupment is not set forth in the record. Payment is being made\npursuant to an income withholding order. In the ensuing years, he has paid over\n$20,000 towards reducing this debt,. The records show that Applicant is current with his\npayments to this governmental creditor. He pays $1,500 a month towards this debt, and\nhas been paying that amount for at least two years. Applicant further testified, and\nevidence shows, that he has been working with the governmental creditor to reduce this\ndebt. (Transcript at 39-42, 56-58, 64-81; Government Exhibit 2 at 3; Applicant Exhibit B\nat 20-21 and 42-53.)3\nMitigation\nApplicant has worked for his employer for two years. His Program Manager\ntestified that customers \u201chave identified him [Applicant] as the poster child for a good\nemployee.\u201d (Transcript at 26.) \nIn recommending the Applicant for a security clearance, the witness stated:\n[W]ith respect to his work ethics and his performance on the job, he\nis someone that I would trust. He demonstrated high ethical values and,\nyou know, good moral character. I know he\u2019s a family man. You know,\neverything I\u2019ve seen has indicated that he is a good guy, upstanding, solid.\n(Transcript at 32.)\nApplicant testified that his financial situation is stable. He and his family live\nfrugally, and have for many years. They have no problems making their debt payments,\n\n4\nincluding those to the governmental authority. The most recent credit report in the file\nshows that his financial situation is good. (Transcript at 71-75; Government Exhibit 2 at\n4; Applicant Exhibit B at 1-31.)\nPolicies\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum. When evaluating an\napplicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the administrative judge must consider\nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory explanations for\neach guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and\nmitigating conditions, which are to be used as appropriate in evaluating an applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision. In addition, the administrative judge may also rely on his own\ncommon sense, as well as his knowledge of the law, human nature, and the ways of the\nworld, in making a reasoned decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Security clearance decisions include, by\nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk that the applicant may deliberately or\ninadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain\ndegree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of\ncompromise of classified information.\n\nThe evidence shows that the tax liens were filed because the Applicant failed to file his tax returns in a timely\n4\nfashion. This act was not alleged in the SOR. However, I have considered the Applicant\u2019s actions in making\nmy findings under the whole person concept, further discussed below.\n5\nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny\ndetermination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant\nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access\nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment,\nor unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant had one delinquent debt, in the amount of $250. He also\nhad tax liens filed against him, and owes over $100,000 to a governmental creditor. The\nevidence is arguably sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions.4\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ As stated\nabove, the Applicant had one past due debt, which he has paid. All the tax liens have\nbeen lifted. Finally, he is not delinquent on his large government debt. This mitigating\ncondition applies.\nAG \u00b6 20(b) states that the disqualifying conditions may be mitigated where \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\n\n6\nunder the circumstances.\u201d  This mitigating condition does not apply because the\nApplicant\u2019s financial situation was not, and is not, dire.\nApplicant paid his one delinquent debt, and also settled his affairs with the state\nand Federal taxing agencies so that they released all of their liens. I have considered\nthe fact that all but one return was filed after the issuance of the SOR. Applicant admits\nthat he was foolish, but has learned an important lesson. Accordingly, AG \u00b6 20(d) is\napplicable under the particular facts of this case in that he \u201cinitiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d  \nAs fully stated above, Applicant has resolved his tax situation, is paying the\ngovernmental creditor in a way that is sufficient for them, and has no delinquent bills.\nUnder the particular circumstances of this case, I find that \u201cthere are clear indications\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d as required by AG \u00b6 20(c).\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the relevant circumstances. Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination\nof whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person\nconcept. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors\nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.      \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe relevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was dilatory in\nfiling his tax returns, but all have now been filed. He fully understands that a return to\nhis dilatory ways of the past can put his holding of a security clearance in jeopardy. He\npaid the one delinquent debt that was alleged in the SOR. I have considered the fact\nthat the governmental creditor in 1.g. is being paid by an income withholding order. In\nthis case, given the nature of the account, and the fact that the creditor has reported the\nApplicant to be \u201ccurrent\u201d or \u201cpaying as agreed,\u201d I find that this is a different situation than\nwhere a debt is paid by garnishment.\nHis spending has not been irresponsible, (AG \u00b6 2(a)(2)). Based on the state of\nthe record, I find that there have been permanent behavioral changes under AG \u00b6\n2(a)(6). Accordingly, at the present time, I find that there is no potential for pressure,\n\n7\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress (AG \u00b6 2(a)(8); and that there is no likelihood of\nrecurrence (AG \u00b6 2(a)(9)). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no questions or doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nsituation.\nOn balance, I conclude that Applicant has successfully overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a DoD security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports granting his request for a security clearance.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.g.:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \nWILFORD H. ROSS\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact1 In her SOR response, Applicant admitted full responsibility for one debt listed in the SOR (SOR \u00b6 1.c, $2,118), which she settled and paid (GE 9 at 1). She admitted she may owe a state tax debt, and filed documentation asking for recalculation of her tax liability (SOR 1.a, $932). She denied responsibility and/or knowledge of the other debts and noted they were not listed on her current credit report. She explained she was unable to research most of the SOR debts because SOR creditors could not locate her records without file or account numbers, which may be on her April 2008 credit report (the basis for the SOR). She requested a copy of the April 2008 credit report and promised to pay her legitimate debts, even though payment might be barred by the State statute of limitation for contracts (six years) (GE 9 at 4). Her admissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 42 years old (Tr. 6, 28). In 1985, she graduated from high school (Tr. 6, 9).

Applicant has \ndemonstrated a meaningful track record of debt repayment. She credibly promised to \npay any valid, unpaid debts listed in her statement of reasons (SOR). Access to \nclassified information is granted.  \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn March 31, 2008, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) Security Clearance Application (SF 86) (Government \nExhibit (GE) 1). On January 22, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued an SOR detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny Applicant \neligibility for access to classified information, citing security concerns under Guideline F \n(Financial Considerations). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1990), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApril 30, 2009\n\n \n \n2 \n \n                                           \nThe SOR detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative \nfinding under the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nor continue a security clearance for her, and recommended referral to an administrative \njudge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or \nrevoked. \n \nOn March 11, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on April \n14, 2009. The case was assigned to me on April 14, 2009. On April 14, 2009, DOHA \nissued a hearing notice. The hearing was held on April 21, 2009. At the hearing, \nDepartment Counsel offered six exhibits (GEs 1-6) (Transcript (Tr.) 22-24), and \nApplicant offered one exhibit (Tr. 76-77, 79-80; AE A). There were no objections, and I \nadmitted GEs 1-6 (Tr. 24), and AE A (Tr. 80). Additionally, I admitted the SOR, \nresponse to the SOR and the hearing notice (GEs 7-9). I received the transcript on April \n29, 2009.   \n \nFindings of Fact1 \n \nIn her SOR response, Applicant admitted full responsibility for one debt listed in \nthe SOR (SOR \u00b6 1.c, $2,118), which she settled and paid (GE 9 at 1). She admitted she \nmay owe a state tax debt, and filed documentation asking for recalculation of her tax \nliability (SOR 1.a, $932). She denied responsibility and/or knowledge of the other debts \nand noted they were not listed on her current credit report. She explained she was \nunable to research most of the SOR debts because SOR creditors could not locate her \nrecords without file or account numbers, which may be on her April 2008 credit report \n(the basis for the SOR). She requested a copy of the April 2008 credit report and \npromised to pay her legitimate debts, even though payment might be barred by the \nState statute of limitation for contracts (six years) (GE 9 at 4). Her admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a complete and thorough review of the \nevidence of record, I make the following findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is 42 years old (Tr. 6, 28). In 1985, she graduated from high school (Tr. \n6, 9). She received her associate\u2019s degree in criminal justice and her bachelor\u2019s degree \nin 2003 (Tr. 6, 28). She is currently working on her master\u2019s degree in business \nadministration (Tr. 7). She married in 1985 and divorced in 1986 (Tr. 9). She married \nthe second time in 1987 and divorced in 1994 (Tr. 9). She married the third time in 1997 \nand divorced in 2004 (Tr. 9). She married her current husband in December 2006 (Tr. \n7). Her stepdaughter is 18, and her biological children are 8, 10, 20 and 23 years old \n(Tr. 8). She attributed her SOR debts to financial problems resulting from her divorces \nand her efforts to support her children (GE 9 at 3-4).  \n \nApplicant moved several times because her third spouse was on active duty. She \nlived in Germany from 2003 to 2006 and was employed as a contract specialist (Tr. 64-\n \n1Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. \n\n \n \n3 \n \n65). Her current husband retired from a military service in June 2007, and has new \nemployment (Tr. 67; GE 2 at 4). She is seeking a Secret clearance (Tr. 10). \n \nIn 2003, Applicant was unemployed for about five months (GE 1 at 47). \nSubsequently, Applicant has not been unemployed, except for seven months when she \nwas in between jobs after moving from one state to another in 2007 (Tr. 66-67). She \nhas worked for a government contractor since December 2007 as a budget and \nfinancial analyst (Tr. 26, 69). She received two certificates of appreciation from the U.S. \nArmy for her work (Tr. 70). In 2008, she was selected as New Employee of the Year (Tr. \n70).  \n \n \nFinancial considerations \n \nApplicant completed her security clearance application on March 31, 2008, and \nnoted that she obtained a list of eight delinquent accounts, totaling $6,565 from a credit \nreport (GE 1 at 41-46). The delinquent accounts ranged from $2,500 to $50 (GE 1 at \n41-46).  She was unfamiliar with most of the creditors and debts. She subsequently paid \nor resolved all of the debts except for four debts, which were subsequently listed on her \nSOR in \u00b6\u00b6 1.f ($50), 1.g ($949), 1.h ($281), and 1.k ($1,035)(GE 8). \n    \nApplicant\u2019s statement of reasons (SOR), dated January 22, 2009, lists 11 \ndelinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.k), totaling $20,299. When Applicant learned she had \ndelinquent debts listed on her credit report in March 2008, she used available credit \nreports to contact creditors to resolve her debts (Tr. 35-37). She resolved five of eight \naccounts on her credit report. In early May 2008, an Office of Personnel Management \n(OPM) investigator questioned Applicant about her knowledge of about 10 additional \ndelinquent debts (AE A). Applicant denied knowledge of most of the accounts and \npromised to attempt to research and resolve them (AE A). On November 25, 2008, \nApplicant responded to DOHA interrogatories about her debts (GE 2). She provided \nproof of payment of some debts, and denied knowledge of other debts (GE 2).  \n \nIn regard to the SOR debts, Applicant was unable to locate sufficient account \ninformation to assist most of the SOR creditors in locating her accounts. Her search for \ncreditors and account numbers was inhibited because she did not have the April 2008 \ncredit report (GE 4) that supported most of the allegations of delinquent SOR debt until \nabout two weeks before her hearing (Applicant received the April 2008 credit report \nfrom previously assigned Department Counsel as part of the discovery process) (Tr. 37, \n40). Applicant was TDY for three weeks prior to her hearing (Tr. 50). She called or \nemailed creditors from her TDY location and asked the creditors to mail information to \nher home address (Tr. 36-37, 41, 50). The creditors sometimes commented that she \nshould not worry about the debts because they were beyond the statute of limitations, \nas many were 10-13 years old, and had been dropped off of her credit reports (Tr. 75, \n77-78; GE 9). She did not know in several cases whether the SOR creditors had \nprovided information to support the validity of the debts listed on the April 2008 credit \nreport because she had not returned home to check her mail in three weeks (Tr. 36-37, \n41, 50). The resolution of her SOR debts is more specifically described as follows:  \n\n \n \n4 \n \n(1) The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($932) is for a state tax lien (Tr. 38-39; GE 3 at 1; GE \n4 at 4). Applicant was unaware of this delinquent debt until April 2008 (GE 9 at 1). In her \nSOR response, she asked for a copy of the April 2008 credit report to help her resolve \nthe debt because this debt was not on her current credit report (GE 9 at 1). Applicant \nagreed she was responsible for this debt (GE 9). Applicant contacted the state and \nasked the state to recalculate her taxes because the tax filing did not correctly indicate \nher filing status as head of household (Tr. 38-39; GE 9 at 6-9, 12). She noted that the \ntax lien had expired (Tr. 38-39). She provided documentation supporting the dispute (Tr. \n38). She expected to learn whether she owed anything in a few weeks (Tr. 38-39). \n \n(2) Applicant denied knowing anything about the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b ($2,990) (Tr. \n39; GE 4 at 5). Applicant was unaware of this delinquent debt until April 2008 (GE 9 at \n1). In her SOR response, she asked for a copy of the April 2008 credit report to help her \nresolve the debt because this debt was not on her current credit report (GE 9 at 1). As \nsoon as she received the April 2008 credit report listing the debt, she contacted the \ncreditor and the creditor promised to provide detailed information about the debt (Tr. \n40). She thought that the debt might be beyond the statute of limitations if it was her \ndebt; nevertheless, she promised to resolve the debt (Tr. 41). \n \n(3) On April 11, 2009, Applicant made the last payment to settle the debt in SOR  \n\u00b6 1.c ($2,118)  for $1,350 (Tr. 41-43; GE 2 at 10; GE 4 at 6; GE 9 at 1, 17). \n \n(4) Applicant did not know anything about the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d ($613) (Tr. 43; \nGE 4 at 6). This debt appears on the April 2008 credit report (GE 5). She was overseas \nfrom the time the account was opened to the time it was reported (Tr. 43). Applicant \nwas unaware of this delinquent debt until April 2008 (GE 9 at 1). In her SOR response, \nshe asked for a copy of the April 2008 credit report to help her resolve the debt because \nthis debt was not on her current credit report (GE 9 at 1). She has not yet contacted the \ncreditor because she just received the April 2008 credit report (Tr. 44). \n \n(5) Applicant did not recognize the medical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e ($949), 1.f ($50), \nand 1.g ($949) (Tr. 45-48; GE 4 at 10, 11, 12). SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.g appear to be a \nduplication of the same debt (Tr. 45-48). Applicant was unaware of this delinquent debt \nuntil April 2008 (GE 9 at 2). She called the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.f, and the creditor was \nunable to locate information about the debt (GE 9 at 2). She noted this debt was not on \nher current credit report (GE 9 at 2). She left two messages for the creditor in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.e and 1.f in the last two weeks; however, she has not received a response from the \ncreditor (Tr. 45-46). If she can obtain sufficient supporting documentation, and the debts \nappear to be valid, she planned to submit the medical debts to TRICARE for payment \n(Tr. 47). \n  \n(6) Applicant had an account with a telephone company listed in SOR \u00b6 1.h \n($281) that apparently became delinquent after she moved overseas (Tr. 49; GE 4 at \n11). Applicant knew she had a debt on her credit report to a collection agency for $281 \n(GE 1 at 44). Applicant was unaware of the source of delinquent debt (telephone \ncompany bill) until April 2008 (GE 9 at 2). She contacted the original creditor, and the \n\n \n \n5 \n \noriginal creditor had no record of her account. She also contacted the collection agent; \nhowever, they could not locate the debt either without information from the April 2008 \ncredit report (GE 9 at 2). In her SOR response, she asked for a copy of the April 2008 \ncredit report to help her resolve the debt because this debt was not on her current credit \nreport (GE 9 at 1). Two weeks before her hearing, she received the April 2008 credit \nreport (GE 5). After she received the April 2008 credit report (GE 5), she contacted the \ncreditor to validate the debt (Tr. 49).  \n \n(7) Applicant had an account with the credit card company listed in SOR \u00b6 1.i \n($5,793) with a limit of $500 (Tr. 50-51; GE 4 at 11; GE 9 at 2). She thought her former \nhusband may have had an account with the same company and generated the debt (Tr. \n51). Applicant was unaware of this delinquent debt until April 2008 (GE 9 at 2). She \ncontacted the creditor, and the creditor had no record of her account (GE 9 at 2). The \ncreditor said they needed the April 2008 credit report to assist in locating the debt. In \nher SOR response, she asked for a copy of the April 2008 credit report to help her \nresolve the debt because this debt was not on her current credit report (GE 9 at 2).  She \nasked the credit card company for information about the debt; however, she did not \nreceive a reply (Tr. 51-52).  \n \n(8) Applicant did not recognize the creditor\u2019s name in SOR \u00b6 1.j ($4,589) (GE 9 at \n2). Applicant was unaware of this delinquent debt until April 2008 (GE 9 at 2). In her \nSOR response, she asked for a copy of the April 2008 credit report to help her resolve \nthe debt because this debt was not on her current credit report (GE 9 at 2). She did not \nget a chance to contact the creditor for the reasons explained previously (Tr. 36-37, 41, \n50, 52-53; GE 4 at 13). \n \n(9) Applicant agreed that she had a telecommunications account with the creditor \nlisted in SOR \u00b6 1.k ($1,035) (Tr. 53; GE 4 at 13; GE 9 at 3). After Applicant moved, her \nhusband kept an account with the creditor (GE 9 at 2). Applicant was unaware of this \ndelinquent debt until March 2008 (GE 1; GE 9 at 2). She called the creditor; however, \nthe creditor was unable to locate the account and thought the April 2008 credit report \nmight have a good account number (GE 9 at 3). In her SOR response, she asked for a \ncopy of the April 2008 credit report to help her resolve the debt because this debt was \nnot on her current credit report (GE 9 at 3). At her hearing, Applicant said her husband \nhad documentation proving this debt was paid (Tr. 54). \n \nApplicant thought she could pay the debts without the assistance of a credit \ncounselor (Tr. 55-56). Applicant\u2019s experience as a contract representative and budget \nanalyst provided her with the skills to prepare a budget.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s credit report, dated February 24, 2009, shows eight debts in \u201cpays as \nagreed\u201d status: (1) a vehicle loan of about $23,000 with a monthly payment of $592 (GE \n9 at 23); (2) a vehicle loan of about $29,000 with a monthly payment of $537 (GE 9 at \n25); (3) a student loan of about $5,000 with monthly payments of $35 (GE 9 at 26); (4) a \nstudent loan of about $1,800 with monthly payments of about $20 (GE 9 at 26); (5) a \ncredit card debt of about $370 with monthly payments of about $35 (GE 9 at 29), (6) a \n\n \n \n6 \n \nrevolving department store account of about $200 (GE 9 at 31), (7) a credit card debt of \nabout $430 with a monthly payment of $30 (GE 9 at 32), and (8) a credit card debt with \na balance of about $500 (GE 9 at 25).  \n \nApplicant provided letters showing payment of six non-SOR creditors (listed as \ndelinquent on credit reports), with accounts resolved on July 31, 2007, October 28, 29 \nand 30, 2008, November 24, 2008, and February 16, 2009 (GE 2 at 2, 11, 12, 13-14, \n15; GE 9 at 5, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16). Applicant\u2019s credit report, dated February 24, 2009, \ncorroborates her other evidence about paying several paid debts after charge off or paid \nafter repossession (GE 9 at 23, 31-32, 33). Applicant made handwritten notes on the \nFebruary 16, 2009, credit report indicating \u201cpaid\u201d to correspond with the receipts she \nprovided for several accounts listed in the report as currently being in delinquent status \n(GE 9 at 5, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16). \n \nApplicant purchased a home in February 2009 (Tr. 56-57). She has two car \nloans, a motorcycle loan, and three credit cards and all six accounts are current (Tr. 59-\n61). See credit report information, supra. She has not missed any payments on her \nvehicle loans (Tr. 62). She has sufficient funds to pay off the balance on her credit cards \nand the $8,000 balance on the motorcycle; however, she prefers to make payments to \nestablish her credit (Tr. 72-73). She provides substantial financial support to her \nchildren (Tr. 62).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s personal financial statement showed her and her husband\u2019s \ncombined monthly gross income is about $9,000, their monthly net income is about \n$8,000, and their monthly balance remaining after paying her debts and expenses is \nabout $3,000 (Tr. 81-86; AE A; GE 2 at 4).   \n \n \nApplicant promised to resolve her debts to the creditors who provided information \nestablishing the validity of her debts even though they are not legally collectable \nbecause of the statute of limitations (Tr. 104-105). \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \nan Applicant eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \n\n \n \n7 \n \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the [A]pplicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. \nOr. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. Thus, \nnothing in this Decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this decision, \nin whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, \nloyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has not met the strict \nguidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for issuing a \nclearance. \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, \nif they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcern is under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the \nsecurity concern relating to financial problems: \n\n \n \n8 \n \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions that \ncould raise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) provides, \u201cApplicant\u2019s credit \nreport was sufficient to establish the Government\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant had  \n[ ] delinquent [SOR] debts that are of security concern.\u201d  Applicant\u2019s history of \ndelinquent debt is documented in her response to DOHA interrogatories, her SOR \nresponse and at her hearing. About ten years ago, she fell behind on some of her credit \ncards and accounts. She failed to ensure her creditors were paid as agreed. The \ngovernment established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n\n \n \n9 \n \n                                           \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b) or \n20(e) because she did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve her \ndelinquent debts. Her delinquent debts are \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the \nAppeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, \n2008) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). Applicant receives \npartial credit under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) because her financial problems initially \nresulted because of her divorces, and partially because of unemployment. She receives \nsubstantial mitigating credit because her delinquent debts \u201coccurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Moreover, she established that \nshe acted responsibly under the circumstances, when she paid or settled and paid six \nnon-SOR delinquent SOR debts, and eight current debts were in \u201cpays as agreed\u201d \nstatus.2 AG \u00b6 20(e) does not fully apply because she did not dispute all of her SOR \ndebts. AG \u00b6 20(e) does fully apply to the two debts that were duplications of each other \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.g (a medical debt for $949)). \n \nAG \u00b6 20(c) partially applies. Applicant did not receive financial counseling and \ntherefore this mitigating condition cannot be fully applied. However, there are \u201cclear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d She understands the \nsecurity implications of delinquent debt and will scrupulously avoid future delinquent \ndebt. She has also established some, but not full mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(d) because \nshe showed good faith3 in the resolution of her SOR debts.    \n \nApplicant should have been more diligent and made greater efforts sooner to \nresolve her delinquent debts. Her actions to date are insufficient to fully apply any of the \n \n2\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component is \nwhether the Applicant maintained contact with his or her creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. \n \n3The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n\n \n \n10 \n \nmitigating conditions. However, security concerns are fully mitigated under the \u201cWhole \nPerson Concept,\u201d infra at pages 10-11.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline F in my whole person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n  \nThere is evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s conduct. About ten years ago, \nseveral of Applicant\u2019s debts became delinquent. Years passed without resolution of her \ndelinquent debts. The SOR lists 11 delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.k), totaling \n$20,299. Because of a duplication, she actually had ten debts, totaling about $19,000. \nShe failed to keep her accounts current and she failed to maintain contact with her \ncreditors. She failed to obtain financial counselling. After her OPM interview and receipt \nof DOHA interrogatories, she did not aggressively seek debt repayment or resolution, \nand sufficiently document her remedial efforts. These factors show some financial \nirresponsibility and lack of judgment. Her history of delinquent debt raises sufficient \nsecurity concerns to merit further inquiry.   \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept is more substantial. \nThere is no evidence of any security violation. She is a law-abiding citizen. Her \ndivorces, support for her five children and two periods of unemployment caused her \nincome to significantly decline and/or her expenses to increase. Some credit card \naccounts or telephone/utility debts became delinquent. She moved several times, and \nher creditors lost track of her. Ultimately, she paid or settled and paid all delinquent \naccounts that she was able to validate. Her current, valid debts, such as her credit \ncards, two vehicle loans, and her mortgage are in \u201ccurrent\u201d status. Her February 24, \n2009, credit report shows eight \u201cpays as agreed\u201d determinations. She provided receipts \nshowing the derogatory determinations on this credit report were resolved through \n\n \n \n11 \n \npayment of her creditors. She is now diligently working to determine the validity of the \nremaining SOR debts. She and her husband have ample income to pay any SOR debts \nthat are valid. The Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole person \nanalysis in financial cases stating: \n \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Board has previously noted that the \nconcept of \u201c\u2018meaningful track record\u2019 necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts.\u201d However, an applicant is \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has \u2018 . . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan.\u2019 The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation \nand his actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for \nthe reduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \nDirective \u00b6  E2.2(a) (\u2018Available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching \na determination.\u2019) There is no requirement that a plan provide for \npayments on all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable \nplan (and concomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such \ndebts one at a time. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts \nactually paid in furtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in \nthe SOR. \n \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations omitted). \nApplicant is 42 years old. She has achieved some important educational goals, \ndemonstrating her self-discipline, responsibility and dedication. She is working on her \nmasters of business administration degree. She has worked for the government \noverseas as a contract administrator and more recently as a budget analyst. She \nunderstands how to budget and what she needs to do to establish her financial \nresponsibility. Years ago, she made mistakes, and her or her former husband\u2019s debts \nbecame delinquent. She compounded those mistakes by failing to act more \naggressively to resolve her debts after her OPM interview. There is, however, simply no \nreason not to trust her. Moreover, she has established a \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d of \ndebt payments by actually paying six non-SOR delinquent debts and a substantial \ndelinquent SOR debt. Most importantly, she is paying her mortgage, two car loans, a \nmotorcycle loan, and three credit cards as agreed. She is diligently endeavoring to \ndetermine whether any remaining SOR debts are valid. She credibly promised to pay \nany valid, remaining SOR debts, even if they are not legally collectible because of the \nState six-year statute of limitations for judicial enforcement of contracts. These factors \nshow responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. She has demonstrated her loyalty, \npatriotism and trustworthiness through her service to the Department of Defense as a \ndefense contractor. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all \nthe facts and circumstances, in the context of the whole person, I conclude she has \nmitigated the financial considerations security concerns.    \n \n\n \n \n12 \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nshe is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a to 1.k: \n For Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nMark W. Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

She has been employed with\nher current employer since May 2008 (GE 1).\nApplicant was born in Thailand and moved to the United States in 1989 (Tr. 31).\nShe graduated from high school and attended university in Thailand. In 1977, she\nobtained her degree in computer science. After college, she worked in her area of\nexpertise in Thailand. Applicant pursued another degree in computer programming in the\nUnited States. She received a degree in 2001. She is married with no children (Tr. 54).\nShe became a naturalized U.S. citizen in August 2000. Her husband is a naturalized\nAmerican citizen. He became a U.S. citizen in 1992. All the members of his family live in\nthe United States. He is from Laos (Tr. 48).\nApplicant\u2019s parents are citizens and residents of Thailand (Tr. 37). They are both\nretired. Her father owned a grocery store and her mother worked in the family store.\nThey are both more than 80 years old (Tr. 38). Applicant talks to her parents on a\nmonthly basis. She visited them in 1998. Applicant has a brother who lives in Thailand.\nShe emails him once a month (Tr.41). Applicant also has two sisters who live in\nThailand. Applicant\u2019s family has no knowledge that Applicant is seeking a security\nclearance (GE 3).\nIn June 2008, Applicant told a security investigator that she would visit her family\nin Thailand once every two or three years (GE 3). However, Applicant\u2019s last visit to\nThailand was in 1998. She cancelled her planned visit in 2006, because she became\nunemployed (Tr. 46). Since she started her new job, she has not had time to visit.\n\n3\nApplicant\u2019s Thai passport, issued on August 29, 1996, has been cancelled (AE C).\nShe has not renewed her Thai passport. She will use her U.S. passport if she visits\nThailand in the future. Initially, she believed that she would need a Thai passport to visit\nher family for extended periods of time. She learned that she can use her U.S. passport.\nShe has no need for a Thai passport (Tr. 52). As of 2001, her Thai passport was\ncancelled.\nApplicant was candid and straightforward at the hearing. She and her husband\nown a condominium in the United States valued at approximately $90,000 (Tr. 58).\nApplicant does not receive any benefits from Thailand. Applicant credibly explained that\nwhen she was interviewed in 2008, she did not understand when asked about\n\u201callegiance.\u201d She misunderstood the question that was asked of her. She acknowledged\nthat she struggles with the English language and its pronunciation (Tr. 32). She later\nasked her supervisor about the word \u201callegiance\u201d and the SOR allegation that was at\nissue concerning Thailand. Her supervisor helped Applicant understand the meaning of\nthe word (Tr. 29). When interviewed, Applicant believed that since she was a dual citizen\nof the United States and Thailand, she could still have a loyalty to her culture (Tr. 28). At\nthe hearing, she was clear that she had no loyalty to the Thai government. She\nconsiders herself a loyal American citizen.  When questioned, she replied that she was\nwilling to renounce her Thai citizenship.\nI have taken administrative notice that Thailand is a constitutional monarchy\ncomposed of a King, Prime Minister and bicameral Legislature. In 2006, a non-violent\ncoup by top military officers, overthrew the government, repealed the constitution, and\nabolished both houses of Parliament. Before the military coup, Thailand enjoyed good\nrelations and military alliances with the U.S. and cooperated with the United States on a\nwide variety of diplomatic and foreign policy issues. After the coup, the United States\nsuspended funding for several military assistance programs, military education programs\nand joint counterterrorism programs. In December 2007, free and fair multi-party\nelections restored democratic governance. However, since this election, two subsequent\nPrime Ministers were forced to resign because of decisions by Thailand\u2019s court system.\nAfter political protests from May through December 2008, resulting in eight deaths and\n700 injuries, a revised coalition came to power.\nIn addition to the political turmoil since the 2006 coup, Thailand has endured a\npersistent separatist insurgency in its majority Muslim southern provinces. Sectarian\nviolence between insurgents and security forces in Thailand\u2019s majority Muslim provinces\nhas left over 3,600 people dead since 2004. Since 2007, attacks have become more\nsophisticated and coordinated. This insurgency has resulted in numerous human rights\nabuses, including killings, committed by ethnic Malay Muslim insurgents, Buddhist\ndefense volunteers and government security forces.\nPolicies\n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan,\n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . .\n\n4\n. control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an\nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person\naccess to such information.\u201d  Id. at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of\nDefense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information\n\u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec.\nOr. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as\namended and modified.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon an applicant meeting the\ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  These guidelines are not\ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these\nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An\nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common\nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information\nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.\nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with\naccess to classified information.  This relationship transcends normal duty hours and\nendures throughout off-duty hours.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the\npossible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard\nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible\nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified\ninformation.\nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of an applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or.\n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of an applicant.  It is merely an indication an applicant has\nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have\nestablished for issuing a clearance\nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the\npersonal or professional history of an applicant that may disqualify an applicant from\nbeing eligible for access to classified information.  The government has the burden of\nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.\n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v.\nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines\npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the\ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. 95-0611\nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial\nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the\nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it\nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d\nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity clearance\n\n5\ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 U.S. at 531;\nsee AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis\nGuideline B (Foreign Influence)\nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s mother and father are citizens and residents of\nThailand (SOR \u00b6 1.a). The security concern relating to Guideline B is set out in AG \u00b6 6\nas follows: \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual\nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a\nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by\nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should\nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or\nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such\nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a\nrisk of terrorism.\nA disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201ccontact with a foreign family member,\nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident\nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation,\ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(a). A disqualifying condition\nalso may be raised by \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country\nthat creates a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect\nsensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person,\ngroup, or country by providing that information.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(b). Applicant\u2019 parents are\ncitizens and residents of Thailand. She contacts her parents approximately once a\nmonth. She last visited them in 1998. Applicant hopes to visit them in the future. Based\non this evidence, AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), and (b) are raised.\nSince the government produced evidence to raise the disqualifying condition in\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant has the burden of\nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the\ngovernment.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe\nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are\nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is\nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the\ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of\nthe U.S.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(a). The totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well\n\n6\nas each individual family tie must be considered.  ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App.\nBd. Sep. 22, 2003). Similarly, AG 8(c) \u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is\nso casual and infrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign\ninfluence or exploitation.\u201d Applicant has contacts with family members living in Thailand\nso these two mitigating conditions cannot be fully applied.\nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United\nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information\nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it,\nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those\nof the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United\nStates over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security.\nFinally, friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially\nin the economic, scientific, and technical fields.  See ISCR Case No. 00-0317, 2002\nDOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002). Nevertheless, the nature of a\nnation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States and its human rights record\nare relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are\nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is\nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family\nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known\nto conduct intelligence operations against the United States.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is\nno conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the\nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such\ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the individual\ncan be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d Applicant\nlives with her husband in the U.S. AG \u00b6 8(b). Applicant has lived in the United States\nsince 1989. She is a naturalized American citizen. Her husband is a naturalized U.S.\ncitizen. She visited Thailand in 1998, but has not returned. She has her family and\nproperty in the United States. Her career is in the United States. Applicant\u2019s testimony at\nthe hearing showed her willingness to sever her ties to Thailand. As such, her testimony\nsupported this mitigating condition. \nGuideline C (Foreign Preference)\nThe SOR alleges Applicant stated in a 2008 interview that she holds allegiance\ntoward Thailand (\u00b6 2.a). The concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 9 as follows:\n\u201cWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a foreign country\nover the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide information or make\ndecisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d  \nDual citizenship standing alone is not sufficient to warrant an adverse security\nclearance decision.  ISCR Case No. 99-0454 at 5, 2000 WL 1805219 (App. Bd. Oct. 17,\n\n7\n2000).  Under Guideline C, \u201cthe issue is not whether an applicant is a dual national, but\nrather whether an applicant shows a preference for a foreign country through actions.\u201d\nISCR Case No. 98-0252 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep 15, 1999).\nA disqualifying condition may arise from \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or\nobligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen,\u201d including but not limited to\n\u201cpossession of a current foreign passport.\u201d  AG \u00b6 10(a)(1). Applicant possessed a Thai\npassport in 1996. AG \u00b6 10(a)(1) is not established because Applicant cancelled the\npassport in 2001. Thus, Applicant does not have a \u201ccurrent foreign passport.\u201d    \nAG 10(d) \u201cany statement or action that shows allegiance to a country other than\nthe United States: for example, declaration of intent to renounce United States\ncitizenship; renunciation of United States citizenship.\u201d Applicant responded in a 2008\ninterview that she is proud of her \u201croots\u201d and has an allegiance to Thailand.\nThe burden shifted to Applicant to rebut, explain, mitigate, or extenuate the facts.\nSeveral mitigating conditions are potentially relevant.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cdual\ncitizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country.\u201d  AG \u00b6\n11(a).  This mitigating condition applies.\nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated if \u201cthe individual has\nexpressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.\u201d Her testimony was sincere and\ncredible on this issue. AG \u00b6 11(e) \u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the\ncognizant security authority, or otherwise is invalidated\u201d applies because the passport\nwas surrendered or invalidated by the Consulate.\nApplicant does not possess a Thai passport. She has no intention of obtaining\nanother one. She admitted that she told an investigator that she has \u201callegiance\u201d to\nThailand. She did not understand the nature and extent of the word. She later asked her\nsupervisor to explain the word to her. Applicant loves her culture, but that does not mean\nthat she is not a loyal U.S. citizen. She explained that her first loyalty is to the United\nStates. She is willing to renounce her Thai citizenship. Applicant has mitigated the\nforeign preference concerns under the above mitigating conditions.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\n\n8\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Some of the factors in AG\n\u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment.\nThere are significant factors supporting the approval of Applicant\u2019s access to\nclassified information. Applicant is a mature, well-educated, and intelligent adult. She\nloves her family and is proud of her culture and heritage. She is a naturalized U.S. citizen\nwho has lived in the United States since 1989. Her spouse, born in Laos, is also a\nnaturalized U.S. citizen. She and her husband have a home in the United States. Her\nhusband\u2019s immediate family live in the United States. I do not believe she is a threat to\nthe United States, but rather an honest, hardworking woman.\nApplicant was born in Thailand and is a dual citizen because of her birth in\nThailand. She had a Thai passport which is now cancelled. Her elderly parents are\nretired and live in Thailand. She has not seen them since 1998. She is willing to\nrenounce her Thai citizenship. She misunderstood the investigator\u2019s question to her in\n2008 concerning allegiance to Thailand. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines B and\nC, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude\nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns based on foreign influence and foreign\npreference. Accordingly, I conclude she has carried her burden of showing that it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified\ninformation.\nFormal Findings\nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set\nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3:\nParagraph 1, Foreign Influence:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Foreign Preference:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\n\n9\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nNoreen A. Lynch\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Clearance is granted.\nOn February 12, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuideline F, financial considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006.\nApplicant answered the SOR on March 18, 2009, admitted all of the allegations\nand requested an administrative determination. On May 27, 2009, Department Counsel\nprepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM). Applicant received it on June 3, 2009, and\nAugust 12, 2009\n\n2\nprovided a nine-page reply on June 18, 2009. On June 25, 2009, the case was\nassigned to me.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 52-year-old, single man. He was married for three years in the\n1990s. The marriage ended in divorce.\nApplicant has been a naturalized U.S. citizen since 1992. The FORM contains no\nrecord of when he emigrated to the U.S. However, judging from the date he attended\ntrade school in the U.S. (1986 to 1987), he has been living here for at least 23 years\n(Item 5 at 13).\nSince approximately March 2008, Applicant has worked in an overseas combat\ntheatre as an interpreter/linguist (Response to FORM at 3). Because of his unique\nlanguage proficiency gained as a native of the country, he is \u201cone of the most qualified\nand distinguished interpreters available\u201d (Id.). His knowledge and personal experiences\nhave helped interrogators \u201cunderstand both the culture and the mentality\u201d of the\ninsurgents (Response at 4). His work ethic is \u201cunprecedented\u201d (Id.).\nAs of October 2008, Applicant owed four creditors approximately $21,000 in\ndelinquent debt (Item 1). Approximately $9,100 constitutes a deficiency remaining from\nan April 2008 foreclosure (SOR subparagraph 1.d - Item 7 at 3). Two debts, collectively\ntotalling approximately $11,500, are owed to credit card companies (SOR\nsubparagraphs 1.a and 1.c), and the remaining debt is a medical bill for approximately\n$500 (SOR subparagraph 1.b). \nApplicant\u2019s debts began growing delinquent in 2002. The record contains no\nevidence concerning the origins of Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. He admitted that\nhis home was foreclosed, but denies he is subject to liability for any deficiency. He\nprovided a copy of a form that the lender filed with the Internal Revenue Service\ncertifying that he is not liable for this debt (Item 4 at 11). I find that Applicant is not\nsubject to liability for the deficiency.\nApplicant satisfied SOR subparagraph 1.b in March 2009 (Item 4 at 10). He\nsatisfied SOR subparagraph 1.c in August 2007 (Response at 2). In his Interrogatory\nResponses, he disclosed another delinquent account, owed to the creditor listed in SOR\nsubparagraph 1.c, for approximately $3,000. By May 2009, he had satisfied this debt\n(Response at 11).\nThe debt listed in SOR subparagraph 1.a remains outstanding. Applicant\u2019s\nresearch of this debt has revealed that the original creditor is no longer the holder.\nInstead, successive assignees have purchased it over the years (Item 4 at 8). The fact\nthat Applicant has worked continuously overseas for the past 18 months has hindered\nhis efforts to locate the current holder of this debt.\n\n3\nApplicant earns approximately $7,269 of net monthly income (Item 6 at 10). He\nhas approximately $5,400 in monthly, after-expense income, and approximately $1,900\nin investments (Id.).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, they are applied together with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge\nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security. Under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is responsible for presenting\n\u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision. \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual=s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information\u201d\n(AG \u00b6 18). Moreover, \u201can individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having\nto engage in illegal acts to generate funds\u201d (Id.). Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies\ntrigger the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and\n19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nThe record contains no evidence of the circumstances surrounding the accrual of\nApplicant\u2019s debt. He accrued at least one of the debts more than six years ago. Neither\nAG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under\nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d nor AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions\n\n4\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss\nof employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d\napply.\nApplicant has satisfied two of the delinquencies completely. He is not legally\nresponsible for the deficiency remaining from the home foreclosure. Although one debt\nremains outstanding, he has attempted to contact the current account holder to resolve\nit. He has ample discretionary income to satisfy this debt. Having addressed the other\nthree obligations, I believe Applicant is likely to pay the remaining debt once he locates\nits holder. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), \u201c. . . there are clear indications that the problem is being\nresolved or is under control,\u201d and 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d apply.\n \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility to occupy a sensitive position by considering the totality of the\napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider\nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination must be an overall commonsense\njudgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person\nconcept.\nAlthough Applicant has satisfied two of the delinquencies, and is no longer\nresponsible for a third, one remains outstanding. Also, I am concerned that the FORM\nprovides no evidence regarding his accrual of the delinquencies. However, these\nconcerns are outweighed by the positive factors in Applicant\u2019s favor - his diligent steps\nto resolve the outstanding delinquency, his disclosure and resolution of an unlisted debt,\nand his strong work ethic. Upon considering this case in light of the whole person\nconcept, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concern.\n\n5\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                             \n_________________\nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Goldstein, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nMay 27, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing\n(e-QIP) on May 19, 2008.  (Government Exhibit 1).  On December 12, 2008, the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865\nand Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, (as\namended) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed\nreasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the\nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a\nsecurity clearance for the Applicant and recommended referral to an Administrative\nJudge to determine whether clearance should be denied or revoked.\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 24, 2009, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  The case was originally assigned to another\nAdministrative Judge on March 23, 2009.  The case was reassigned to the undersigned\nAdministrative Judge on April 6, 2009.  A notice of hearing was issued on April 7, 2009,\nscheduling the hearing for April 28, 2009.  The Government offered six exhibits, referred\nto as Government Exhibits 1 through 6, which were received without objection.\nApplicant offered nine exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through I.  She also\ntestified on her own behalf.  The record remained open until close of business on May\n19, 2009 to allow the Applicant to submit additional documentation.  Applicant submitted\neight Post-Hearing Exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibits 1 through\n\n2\n8, which were admitted into evidence without objection. The transcript of the hearing\n(Tr.) was received on May 6, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nThe Government\u2019s motion to amend allegations 1(a), 1(b), 1(c) and 1(d) to delete\nand remove all extraneous comments following, \u201cAs of December 2, 2008, this debt has\nnot been paid,\u201d was granted.  As was the Government\u2019s motion to amend allegation\n1(e), to delete and remove all extraneous comments following, \u201cAs of May 28, 2008, this\ndebt had not been paid.\u201d  Applicant had no objection to said amendments.  \n FINDINGS OF FACT\nThe Applicant is 23 years old and has a high school diploma and two years of\ncollege.  She is employed by a defense contractor as a Administrative Assistant to the\nGovernment Security Operations Manager and is seeking to obtain a security clearance\nin connection with her employment.\nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  The following findings\nof fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the SOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because she is financially overextended and at risk\nof  having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.      \nThe Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this\nguideline that include indebtedness to five separate creditors totaling approximately\n$15,000.00.  There debts are reflected in the Applicant\u2019s Credit Reports dated May 28,\n2008; December 2, 2008; and March 9, 2009.  (See Government Exhibits 3, 4 and 5).  \nApplicant testified that at the young age of sixteen, while still in high school, she\ngot married and became pregnant with her first child.  Her husband, who was two years\nolder, joined the military to support them.  Two years later, the Applicant had her second\nchild.  In 2004, her husband got out of the military.  That same year, she and her\nhusband separated and she had to find employment for the first time in her life.  She\nhad several jobs before landing her current employment.  She began her current\nemployment on April 14, 2008.  She receives no child support, alimony or any other\nfinancial assistance from her husband who is currently not working.  She and her\nchildren recently moved back with her parents in order to save money, pay her bills and\nfinish school. \nAs a direct result of her marital separation, and her husband\u2019s failure to provide\nany financial assistance to her and her children, she became indebted to several\ncreditors.  She is indebted to a bank for a credit card in the amount of $605.00.  She\ntestified that her husband opened the account and put her down as an alternate.  She\n\n3\nnever signed the application to apply for the credit card, nor did she ever use the\naccount for anything.  It was exclusively his.  Applicant testified that she is going to\ncontact the credit agencies to dispute the debt and have it removed from her credit\nreport.  Applicant\u2019s most recent credit report reflects that the debt has been removed.\n(Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit 3).  \nShe is indebted to the Department of Education for student loans in the amount\nof $842.00, $1,326.00 and $3,425.00 that she incurred while he was in the military.\nSince November 2008, the Applicant has been paying $75.00 per month towards all\nthree student loans and the creditor finds this payment acceptable at this time.\n(Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit 3 and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A, B, C, D, E and F).  \nShe is indebted to a car company in the amount of $8,852.00 for a vehicle that\nwas repossessed.  She testified that when she and her husband separated, he took the\ncar and gave it to his parents with the understanding that they were going to make the\npayments.  They did not make the payments.  In November 2008, the Applicant\ncontacted the creditor about the debt.  They told her that they would contact her\nhusband.  The Applicant thought that the creditor had worked something out with her\nhusband because she was no longer receiving collection calls for payment. (Tr p. 70).\nAt some later date she again contacted the creditor and was told that they would send\nsomething to her by mail and she could start making payments.  She recently set up a\npayment plan of $100.00 a month that she will pay until the debt is paid in full.\n(Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit 4).\n   \nThe Applicant currently earns about $2,400 a month.  She pays no rent or child\ncare fees because her parents are helping her with that.  After paying her monthly bills,\nshe has between $400.00 and $500.00 left to use toward her delinquent debts.\nApplicant\u2019s Post Hearing Exhibit indicates that starting June 2009, Applicant\u2019s father\nwas laid off from his job and Applicant will be paying at least $200.00 a month to help\nwith the rent.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit 2).     \nApplicant received a Certificate of Completion for successful completion at a\nConference for Administrative Professionals.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit H).\nA letter of recommendation dated July 16, 2008, from the site Director of Security\nand Emergency Services indicates that he was impressed with the Applicant\u2019s attention\nto detail resulting in a first class affair held for a company employee.  This indicates that\nthe Applicant is competent on the job.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I). \nLetters of commendation from the Applicant\u2019s previous manager, previous lead,\nand past and present co-workers indicate that the Applicant demonstrates superior work\nethics and exceeds expectation in her job position.  She has a positive attitude, is highly\ndependable, hardworking, punctual and is a team player.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing\nExhibits 5, 6, 7 and 8).\n \n\n4\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into\n\"Disqualifying Factors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors\nand Mitigating Factors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds. \nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n19.(c) a history of not meeting financial obligation; \n19.(e) consistent spending beyond ones means, which may be indicated by\nexcessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio,\nand/or other financial analysis. \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n20.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances;\n20.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\n a.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct\n     b.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\n\n5\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The extent to which participation is voluntary\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, the security of classified industrial secrets is entrusted to\ncivilian workers who must be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information\ntwenty-four hours per day, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore\nappropriately concerned when available information indicates that an Applicant for\nclearance may be involved in instances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates\npoor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\n\n6\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant her a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with her security clearance eligibility.\nConsidering all of the evidence, the Applicant has introduced persuasive\nevidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation that is sufficient to overcome the\nGovernment's case.  Applicant\u2019s separated from her husband, and the loss of his\nincome and financial support was the primary cause for her financial problems.  Seven\nyears have passed since she married and became pregnant with her first child.  Over\nthat time, she has matured significantly.  She has reduced her expenses by recently\nmoving back to her parent\u2019s home with her children in order to save money that she can\nuse to pay her delinquent debts.  She has contacted each of her creditors and is either\nsetting up payment plans to pay them, or is currently paying the debt on a monthly\nbasis.  She plans to continue to pay them until they are resolved.  She is planning on\ngoing to college at night to further enhance her career.  She understands that she must\nalways be responsible in everything she does and every decision she makes.  She also\nunderstands that she must always live within her means and pay her bills on time.\nUnder the particular circumstances of this case, she has made a good faith effort to\nresolve his indebtedness, and there is evidence of financial rehabilitation.  The Applicant\nhas demonstrated that she can properly handle her financial affairs.\n     Under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), Disqualifying Conditions 19.(a)\ninability  or  unwillingness to satisfy debts; 19.(c) a history of not meeting financial\nobligations; and 19.(e) consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, which may be\nindicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ratio, and/or other financial analysis apply.  However, Mitigating Conditions\n20.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the\nperson\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical\nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly\nunder the circumstances; 20.(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for\nthe problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control and 20.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts also apply.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant\nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations).    \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of good judgement, trustworthiness, reliability, candor, a\n\n7\nwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and/or other characteristics indicating\nthat the person may properly safeguard classified information.\n  \nI have considered all of the evidence presented and it sufficiently mitigates the\nadverse information brought against her.  On balance, it is concluded that the Applicant\nhas overcome the Government's case opposing her request for a security clearance.\nAccordingly, the evidence supports a finding for the Applicant as to the factual and\nconclusionary allegations expressed in Paragraph 1 of the SOR.    \n     \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: \nFor the Applicant.\n    \n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nFor the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nFor the Applicant.\n   \n   \nDECISION\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant denied the SOR allegations, except for 1.a., 1.f., and 1.g. He is a 45- year-old managing consultant employed by a defense contractor since March 2007. He has not previously held a clearance. The SOR originally alleged, and government exhibits confirmed, eight delinquent debts totaling just nearly $68,000. However, record evidence revealed that the debt at 1.b. was a duplicate of 1.h. and the debt at 1.e. was a duplicate of 1.f. Consequently, I find 1.e. and 1.h for Applicant, and the resulting debt to be discussed is six debts totaling over $43,000. Applicant initially admitted three debts totaling over $12,000. He now admits four debts totaling nearly $30,000. Except for his denial of 1.d.\u2014which he claims is not his account\u2014his initial denials were based on his disputing the amount owed, not disputing that he owed money to the listed creditor. Applicant had no financial problems until he was laid off from his job in May 2002. He was one of the last employees hired by his company, and thus was one of the first let go when the company had a reduction in force. He was making about $73,000 per year at the time. He remained unemployed until December 2005 when he moved to another state to obtain employment. His new job paid about $85,000 per year.

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: John F. Mardula, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMETZ, John Grattan, Jr., Administrative Judge:\nOn 10 December 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under\nGuideline F.  Applicant answered the SOR 19 January 2009, requesting a hearing.\n1\nDOHA assigned the case to me 17 February 2009, and I convened a hearing 19 March\n2009. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) 27 March 2009.\n \nAugust 31, 2009\n\n2\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant denied the SOR allegations, except for 1.a., 1.f., and 1.g. He is a 45-\nyear-old managing consultant employed by a defense contractor since March 2007. He\nhas not previously held a clearance.\nThe SOR originally alleged, and government exhibits confirmed, eight delinquent\ndebts totaling just nearly $68,000. However, record evidence revealed that the debt at\n1.b. was a duplicate of 1.h. and the debt at 1.e. was a duplicate of 1.f. Consequently, I\nfind 1.e. and 1.h for Applicant, and the resulting debt to be discussed is six debts\ntotaling over $43,000. Applicant initially admitted three debts totaling over $12,000. He\nnow admits four debts totaling nearly $30,000. Except for his denial of 1.d.\u2014which he\nclaims is not his account\u2014his initial denials were based on his disputing the amount\nowed, not disputing that he owed money to the listed creditor.\nApplicant had no financial problems until he was laid off from his job in May\n2002. He was one of the last employees hired by his company, and thus was one of the\nfirst let go when the company had a reduction in force. He was making about $73,000\nper year at the time. He remained unemployed until December 2005 when he moved to\nanother state to obtain employment. His new job paid about $85,000 per year. His\ncurrent job pays about $112,000 per year, plus an anticipated bonus.\nApplicant\u2019s finances collapsed while he was unemployed. He sold his house,\nvoluntarily surrendered his car, and was homeless for a few days until he moved in with\nhis mother. He fell behind in his child support payments, incurred liens for back taxes,\nand fell delinquent on numerous credit accounts.\nWhen he regained employment, Applicant first caught up with his child support\npayments. He then paid his back taxes. Finally, he paid his mother back for his share of\nhousing expenses. He also began working with a credit counselor back in his home\nstate. The counselor helped Applicant establish a budget and devise a plan for dealing\nwith his delinquent debts. The first phase of the plan was for Applicant to pay creditors\nto whom he owed less than $1,000. Record evidence shows that Applicant paid a\nnumber of such debts in early 2007, and Applicant\u2019s credit reports reflect an improving\ntrend with his finances.\nExcept for the debt at 1.a., the debts alleged in the SOR are all over $1,000.\nRecord evidence shows Applicant paid the debt at 1.a. three days before the hearing\n(A.E. E). Applicant\u2019s plan for the remainder of the debts alleged in the SOR was to\nconsolidate them into a single payment plan through his credit counselor. However,\nApplicant had some difficulty identifying the correct creditor or successor-in-interest on\nsome accounts. He was also unwilling to establish a payment plan with a creditor until\nhe could get a firm number on the balance owed. But because of interest charges, he\ndiscovered that the balance given to him in telephone conversations with the creditor\nwas not the same balance listed when the creditor sent settlement proposals.\n\nSee, Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n2\n3\nConsequently, at hearing, Applicant did not have a plan for addressing his remaining\ndebts, but more like a plan for a plan.\nApplicant\u2019s post-hearing submission (A.E. F) contains a current budget and a\nproposed repayment plan that would pay his acknowledged creditors in full by April\n2011 (beginning in April 2009). The proposed repayment plan assumes both that the\ncreditors will agree to the proposed monthly payment and that the creditors will waive\nfurther interest and fees. Applicant proffers that the proposed schedule is a conservative\none; that he may be able to accelerate payments over the two years repayment period.\nApplicant\u2019s character references, both of whom have known him many years,\nconsider him honest and trustworthy and recommend him for his clearance. The record\ncontains no work references.\nPolicies\nThe Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (RAG) list factors to be considered in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access to classified information. Administrative\nJudges must assess both disqualifying and mitigating conditions under each issue fairly\nraised by the facts and circumstances presented. Each decision must also reflect a fair\nand impartial commonsense consideration of the factors listed in RAG \u00b6 2(a). The\npresence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not determinative for or\nagainst Applicant. However, specific adjudicative guidelines should be followed where a\ncase can be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing the\ngrant or denial of access to classified information. Considering the SOR allegations and\nthe evidence as a whole, the relevant, applicable, adjudicative guideline is Guideline F\n(Financial Considerations).\nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant or continue an Applicant\u2019s security clearance. The government\nmust prove, by something less than a preponderance of the evidence, controverted\nfacts alleged in the SOR. If it does so, it establishes a prima facie case against access\nto classified information. Applicant must then refute, extenuate, or mitigate the\ngovernment\u2019s case. Because no one has a right to a security clearance, the Applicant\nbears a heavy burden of persuasion.\nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship\nwith the government based on trust and confidence. Therefore, the government has a\ncompelling interest in ensuring each Applicant possesses the requisite judgement,\nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interests as their own.\nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any\nreasonable doubt about an Applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the government.2\n\nI have excluded the disputed debt at 1.d. from my analysis despite the fact that multiple credit reports show\n3\nit to be Applicant\u2019s individual account and he has documented neither a potential basis for disputing the\naccount nor success in getting it removed from his credit report.\n\u00b6 19.(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; (c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\n4\n\u00b6 20.(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that\n5\nit is  unlikely to recur .\n\u00b6 20.(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control . . . and\n6\nthe individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\n\u00b6 20.(c)  the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and there are clear indications\n7\nthat the problem is being resolved or is under control.\n\u00b6 20.(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\n8\n4\nAnalysis\nThe government established a case for disqualification under Guideline F, and\nApplicant did not fully mitigate the security concerns. While Applicant documented\nsignificant efforts to rehabilitate his finances since regaining employment in December\n2005, he still did not have a plan in place to address over $30,000  in delinquent debt.\n3\n4\nWithout question, Applicant\u2019s significant period of unemployment caused his financial\ndifficulties. But after several years of progress with his delinquent debts, he seems to\nhave stalled without justification or credible explanation.\nApplicant partially satisfies several of the mitigating factors for financial concerns,\nbut not enough to overcome the negative inferences of those problems. His financial\ndifficulties are both recent and multiple.  The debts were almost entirely due to\n5\ncircumstances beyond his control, and while he initially acted responsibly in addressing\nhis debts, his follow through on his remaining debts has been inadequate.   Although,\n6\nhe sought credit counseling and made significant initial progress on his debts, too much\nremains unsettled to conclude he has brought the problem under control.  He has\n7\noutlined a plan that would address the remaining debts in a reasonable period of time,\nbut without agreement by the creditors, and an established track record of payments, it\nremains to be seen if Applicant will put his financial problems behind him. He has the\nmeans, but does he have the will. Put another way, there is nothing in Applicant\u2019s post-\nhearing submission that could not have been accomplished long before the SOR was\nissued. Further, the record reflects a good-faith effort to satisfy the debts that were not\nalleged in the SOR, but only belated efforts on the debts that were alleged.  I conclude\n8\nGuideline F against Applicant.\nFormal Findings\nParagraph 1.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact, below. FINDINGS OF FACT The following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the testimony and the exhibits. The Applicant is 34 years of age and has two Master\u2019s of Science Degrees; in Systems Engineering and in Business Administration. She is employed as a Senior Systems Engineer for a defense contractor. She seeks a security clearance in connection with her employment in the defense industry. Paragraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence). The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she has foreign contacts that could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. The Applicant was born in Taipei, Taiwan in 1975. In 1989, at the age of fourteen, the Applicant\u2019s aunt and uncle gave her the opportunity to move to the United States to obtain a better education and to pursue sports, so she did. Applicant moved to the United States, became ingrained in the American way, and became a naturalized United States citizen in February 1992. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I). By the age of sixteen, Applicant\u2019s biological aunt and uncle by marriage attempted to adopt her, but at the time were going through a divorce. Applicant\u2019s aunt moved out of the house, and the Applicant was subsequently adopted by her American uncle.

Goldstein, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Personal Representative, Gerald Martinez\nDecember 10, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted her Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing\non May 15, 2009.  (Government Exhibit 1).  On June 17, 2009, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline B for Applicant. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \n \nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on July 6, 2009, and she requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned on July 30, 2009.  A notice of hearing was issued on August 12, 2009,\nscheduling the hearing for September 23, 2009.  At the hearing the Government\npresented three exhibits, referred to Government Exhibits 1 through 3, which were\nadmitted without objection.  The Applicant presented fourteen exhibits, referred to as\n\n2\nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits A through N, which were admitted without objection, and testified on\nher own behalf.  The record remained open until close of business on October 8, 2009\nto allow the Applicant the opportunity to submit additional documentation.  The\nApplicant submitted three Post-Hearing Exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing\nExhibits A through C that were admitted without objection.  The official transcript (Tr.)\nwas received on October 5, 2009.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts concerning the current political conditions in Taiwan.  Applicant had no\nobjection.  (Tr. p. 10).  The request and the attached documents were not admitted into\nevidence but were included in the record. The facts administratively noticed are set out\nin the Findings of Fact, below. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the\ntestimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 34 years of age and has two Master\u2019s of\nScience Degrees; in Systems Engineering and in Business Administration.  She is\nemployed as a Senior Systems Engineer for a defense contractor.  She seeks a security\nclearance in connection with her employment in the defense industry.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because she has foreign contacts\nthat could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise\nof classified information.\nThe Applicant was born in Taipei, Taiwan in 1975.  In 1989, at the age of\nfourteen, the Applicant\u2019s aunt and uncle gave her the opportunity to move to the United\nStates to obtain a better education and to pursue sports, so she did.  Applicant moved\nto the United States, became ingrained in the American way, and became a naturalized\nUnited States citizen in February 1992.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit I).  By the age of sixteen,\nApplicant\u2019s biological aunt and uncle by marriage attempted to adopt her, but at the time\nwere going through a divorce.  Applicant\u2019s aunt moved out of the house, and the\nApplicant was subsequently adopted by her American uncle.  While in college, the\nApplicant, an excellent student, received an internship with her employer, a defense\ncontractor, and in 2000, was offered a full time position with the company that she has\nheld successfully since then.    \nThe Applicant\u2019s biological parents are citizens of and reside in Taiwan.\nApplicant\u2019s biological father is a chiropractor.  Applicant\u2019s biological mother is a\n\n3\nhousewife.  Applicant contacts her biological mother about once a week to see how she\nis doing. \n     \nThe Applicant has two adopted children, who are actually her biological niece\nand nephew.  She adopted her biological brother\u2019s children, to give them the same\nopportunity she had to come to the United States to study.  Both of the adopted children\nare dual citizens of the United States and Taiwan.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits L and M).  The\nchildren contact their biological parents on a daily basis by telephone or web-cam.\nApplicant believes as their adopted parent, even though one of them is 19 years old and\nno longer a minor, they both want to permanently stay in the United States.  \nThe Applicant has three biological brothers who are citizens of and reside in\nTaiwan.  One of her brothers is an optometrist for a private company, his wife is his\nassistant.  Another brother works in the cosmetic business and his wife is an\naccountant.  Her third brother is a laboratory assistant at a college.  All of her brothers\nknow that she is an Engineer, but they do not discuss her work.  She speaks to her\nbrothers between one and three times a year.\nThe Applicant traveled to Taiwan in December 2007, January 2006, December\n2003, December 2001 and August 2000 to visit family and friends who are citizens and\nresidents of Taiwan.  On those trips, she stayed with her biological parents and spent\nbetween 17 and 21 days.  Her only contact with her friends is when she visits there.  On\nthose occasions she has used her Taiwanese passport to enter and exit Taiwan for\nconvenience.  Realizing that possession of a foreign passport can jeopardize her\nchances of obtaining a security clearance, the Applicant has destroyed her Taiwanese\npassport, and is also willing to renounce her Taiwanese citizenship.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\nN).  In her mind she is only a United States citizen.  She states that she has no patriotic\nfeelings toward Taiwan.   \nNo one has ever approached the Applicant to obtain sensitive or classified\ninformation.  (Tr. pp. 75-76).  None of her family in Taiwan know that she is applying for\na security clearance, and she has no intention of telling them.  To her knowledge, none\nof her family in Taiwan is associated with the Taiwanese government.  The Applicant\nhas no financial assets outside of the United States and no knowledge of any possible\ninheritance in Taiwan.  (Tr. p. 111, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits F, G and H).  Applicant\nprovides no financial support to any of her family or friends in Taiwan. \n   \nTestimony from the Applicant\u2019s section manager, who is also her supervisor at\ntimes, attests to her professionalism, her value to the company, and her skill in the field\nof engineering.  Her work product \u201cexceeds expectations\u201d for 2008, and she was\npromoted last year.  He recommends her for a position of trust.  (Tr. pp. 55-61).      \nLetters of recommendation from Applicant\u2019s colleagues indicate that she is an\neager and excellent learner, who has strived for excellence and has consistently\ndemonstrated it.  She is a promising young engineer who is conscientious, enthusiastic,\nconsiderate and thoughtful.  She is considered honest, trustworthy, with integrity beyond\n\n4\nher years.  In their opinion, she had demonstrated complete loyalty to the United States\nand is proud to be an American.  She is a strong candidate for a security clearance.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A).\nA letter from the Applicant\u2019s adopted American father attests to the Applicant\u2019s\nhard working character, trustworthiness and responsible nature.  He states that she\nexhibits loyalty to the United States and he considers her to be a \u201cmodel American\ncitizen\u201d.  He strongly recommends her for a position of trust.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing\nExhibit A).\n   \nA letter from a coworker, who has been the Applicant\u2019 s mentor in the past, states\nthat the Applicant is energetic and enthusiastic.  She is also said to be a quick learner\nwho maintains a positive outlook.  She is considered to be person with a high level of\nintegrity, honesty and trustworthiness.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit B).\nA letter from a Senior Principal Engineer, who also a colleague of the Applicant\u2019s,\nand has overseen her work product, states that she is an outstanding engineer.  She\ncan be relied upon in any instance to get the job done at its highest level of\ncompleteness.  He states that the Applicant has exceptional leadership, responsibility,\ndependability and communication skills.  (Applicant\u2019s Post-Hearing Exhibit C).\n \nApplicant received an award of recognition for her dedicated service on the job.\n(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit E).\n \nI have taken official notice of the following facts concerning the Taiwan.  Taiwan\nis a multi-party democracy with a population of about 23 million. It is one of the most\nactive collectors of sensitive United States information and technology.  Numerous\nindividuals and companies have been subjected to civil penalties and, or prosecuted for\nillegally exporting, or attempting to illegally export, sensitive United States technology to\nTaiwan.  One United States official was recently convicted of crimes relating to his\nimproper relationship with a Taiwanese intelligence official.\nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the\nDepartment of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors\nand conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given\nbinding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors\nshould be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the\nconditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can\nthey supersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and\ncircumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human\nexperience, or apply equally in every  case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth\nabove, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:\n\n5\nForeign Influence\n6.  The Concern.  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism. \nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n7(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion. \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n8(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country\nare such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S.;\n8(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty\nor obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the\nindividual has such deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that\nthe individual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor in the U.S.\ninterest;  \n8(c) Contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent\nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 18-19, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding\ncircumstances;\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation;\n\n6\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct;\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;\ne.  The extent to which the participation was voluntary;\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral\nchanges;\ng.  The motivation for the conduct; \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress; and\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\neligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is\npredicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The\nadjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the\nwhole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination. \nThe Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw\ninferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in\nnature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865,\n\u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline B (foreign influence)\nthat establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While\na rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct\nand her ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency\nof proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in\nrefutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past\nadverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for\na security clearance.\n\n7\nAn individual who demonstrates a foreign influence and has foreign connections\nmay be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests\nof the United States.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of\nconfidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations,\nat all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSION\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal\nstandards and factors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the\nrecord, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its\ncase as to all allegations in the SOR.   \nUnder Foreign Influence, Disqualifying Condition 7(a) contact with a foreign\nfamily member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a\ncitizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion applies.  However,\nMitigating Conditions 8(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the\ncountry in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those\npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group,\norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S., 8(b) the nature of the\nrelationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are located, or\nthe positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the\nindividual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a\nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the U.S.; and\n8(c) Contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that\nthere is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation also\napply.\nAlthough the Applicant\u2019s biological parents and three brothers are residents and\ncitizens of Taiwan, the Applicant has only casual and limited contact with them.  Her\nearly years as a child were spent in Taiwan, but her entire adult life has been spent in\nthe United States.  She left her biological parents for the opportunity of moving to the\nUnited States. She attended high school and college in the United States, where she\nexcelled, and obtained advanced degrees.  For the past twenty years, she has made\nthe United States her permanent home.  Clearly, the Applicant\u2019s deep and abiding ties\nare here in the United States.  She has worked hard to establish herself as a\nresponsible, educated, productive United States citizen.  She adopted her niece and\nnephew to be able to provide them the same American values and opportunities that\nshe has been given.  All of her assets are in the United States.  Although she maintains\nsome casual and infrequent contact with her biological mother, brothers, and a few\nfriends, the nature of the conversations are just that, casual.  \n\n8\nIt is noted that the current political situation in Taiwan elevates the cause for\nconcern in this case.  However, the evidence shows that the Applicant has no bond and\naffection with her foreign family members or to any foreign individual, or to Taiwan, in\nany way that could potentially cause the Applicant to become subject to foreign\nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.  She has made that clear.\nShe has surrendered her Taiwanese passport and is willing to renounce her Taiwanese\ncitizenship.  There is no possibility of foreign influence that could create the potential for\nconduct resulting in the compromise of classified information.  She has demonstrated\nthat she can be trusted with sensitive classified information.  I find that the Applicant is\nnot vulnerable to foreign influence.  Accordingly, I find for the Applicant under Guideline\nB (Foreign Influence).\nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\nSubpara.\n1.a.: For the Applicant\nSubpara.\n1.b.: For the Applicant\nSubpara.\n1.c.: For the Applicant\nSubpara.\n1.d.: For the Applicant\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n \n",

Clearance is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted a Security Clearance Application (SF-86) on January 11, \n2008. On December 8, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nJuly 16, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 5, 2009, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. DOHA received his response on January 8, \n2008. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on February 10, 2009, and I \nreceived the case assignment on February 12, 2009. DOHA issued a notice of hearing \non March 12, 2009, scheduling the hearing for April 9, 2009.  The hearing was held as \nscheduled. \n \nThe Government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 11, which were \nreceived without objection. The Government also offered a List of Government Exhibits, \n(Ex) I. The Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through E, which were received \nwithout objection, and testified on his own behalf. DOHA received the hearing transcript \n(Tr.) on April 17, 2009. \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nAmendment of SOR \n \n \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR to reflect the correct spelling of \nApplicant\u2019s last name. Without objection from the Applicant, I granted Department \nCounsel\u2019s motion.

After a complete and thorough \nreview of the evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact:  \n \nApplicant is a 49-year-old custodian1, who has worked for his defense contractor \nemployer since February 2008. GE 1, Tr. 14, 19-20. He seeks a security clearance to \nenhance his position within his company. Without a clearance, he is only authorized to \nenter unsecure spaces. If his duties require him to enter a secure space, he is required \nto have an escort. Tr. 20-22. \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in June 1978.

He \nstated, \u201c[m]y ex was so mad with me that she just didn\u2019t let me see them.\u201d Tr. 17. \n \nThe SOR alleged 11 separate incidents involving Applicant that required law \nenforcement intervention. These incidents spanned a 22-year period from January 1986 \nto February 2008. With the exception of a March 1999 incident, which Applicant denied, \n \n1 Applicant described his duties as a custodian to consist of vacuuming, cleaning, \ndusting, and emptying the trash.

Applicant \nstated he was drunk \nwhile crossing \nstreet. \n \n \nApplicant adamantly denies any wrongdoing stemming from his October 1999 \narrest for sexual battery (SOR \u00b6 1.c.). He explained at the time he was living with his \ngirlfriend and her teenage children, a daughter and a son. Tension developed between \nApplicant and his girlfriend\u2019s children, which resulted in his girlfriend\u2019s daughter filing a \nfalse accusation of sexual battery against him. Shortly after the incident, his girlfriend \nsent him a letter of apology. Applicant has had no communication with his former \ngirlfriend since receiving the letter of apology. Tr. 57-64, GE 3. \n \nRegarding his unpaid fines accumulated throughout the years, Applicant testified \nthat he is making payments \u201cwhen [he] can,\u201d that the courts are \u201cworking with [him],\u201d he \nestimates he has made \u201cthree or four\u201d payments towards his unpaid fines, and \nestimates he owes \u201c[o]ver 1,000 [dollars]\u201d balance in unpaid fines. He also understands \nhe has to address the community service he has yet to perform from previous \nsentences throughout the years. Tr. 72-73, 91-92. \n \nApplicant recently had his driver\u2019s license reinstated in March 2009, which he lost \nafter his February 1990 DUI arrest. Tr. 76-77. Applicant has been involved in a nine-\nyear relationship with his fianc\u00e9, who works in the area of behavioral health. They live \ntogether and share expenses. Applicant stated his fianc\u00e9 \u201cwouldn\u2019t agree on marrying \nme until I got a permanent job that\u2019s steady, and I don\u2019t blame her.\u201d Tr. 78-80. \n \nApplicant stated he is different today from the person who was arrested 11 times \nover a 22-year period: \n \nWell, back then, like I said, I was going through a lot with my parents\u2019 \nillnesses. My dad had cancer, and my mom [had] heart problems and \ndiabetes. I did a lot of dumb things, you know. My head wasn\u2019t right. Now \nthat \u2013 excuse me. Now that they\u2019re gone, I can straighten out my life and \nbetter myself. And that\u2019s what I want to do. I want to make them proud. \nExcuse me for the outburst.  \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \n \nAnd that\u2019s the difference, I think, that I\u2019m learning. You know, it\u2019s a long \nprocess. It was a long process for me to learn, but I do learn from my \nmistakes. Sorry about that. Tr. 86-87. \n \nSince working, Applicant has reduced a $36,000 child support arrearage to \n$30,000 in the last three to four years through recoupment from his tax refunds and \nwage garnishment. Tr. 88-90, AE C. \n \nApplicant submitted a work-related reference from a supervisor, who \ncomplimented him on his work ethic and job performance. AE D. He also submitted two \nTeam Achievement Awards from 2008 and 2009 in recognition of his \u201congoing \ncommitment to outstanding job performance.\u201d AE F, AE E. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe purpose of a security clearance decision is to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information.2 \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s controlling \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d3 In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \n \n2  See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \n \n3  Egan, supra, at 528, 531. \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) \n \nUnder Adjudicative Guideline \u00b6 15, the security concern is: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nAG \u00b6 16 sets out one condition that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard protected information. \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \nThe Government established through Applicant\u2019s admissions and evidence \npresented that he has had numerous arrests/citations from January 1986 to February \n2008, spanning a 22-year period. His most recent citation occurred one month after \nsubmitting his SF-86. His arrests/citations cover a wide range to include drugs and drug \nparaphernalia, driving under the influence, hit and run, criminal trespassing, aggravated \ncriminal damage, disorderly conduct, shoplifting, driving with a suspended license, \nfailure to have proof of insurance, and public nuisance. \n \nHe has yet to pay fines and perform community service going back to his \nFebruary 1990 arrest. His recent attempts to address past due court fines and \nunperformed community service fall short when considering the length of time involved \nsince they became due and/or were imposed. \n \nPotential mitigating conditions listed under AG \u00b6 17 are: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress; and \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability. \n \nFor reasons discussed supra, none of the potential mitigating conditions under \nthis concern are applicable. \n \nUnder the totality of the circumstances, I find Applicant\u2019s behavior is recent and \nnot isolated. Considering his behavior, the nature and seriousness of his misconduct, \nhis exercise of repeated poor judgment culminating in his recent citation for public \nnuisance one month after submitting his SF-86, and other factors identified supra, I find \nhis favorable information is not sufficient to mitigate Guideline E security concerns. His \nconduct raises questions about his ability and willingness to follow the law, and \nultimately, to protect classified information. His conduct also raises serious doubts and \nquestions about his judgment. Further time and additional evidence is needed before I \ncan overcome my concerns/doubts regarding Applicant\u2019s questionable judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. \n \n \nTo conclude, Applicant presented insufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nrefute personal conduct security concerns. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden of \npersuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this conclusion, the \nwhole person concept was given due consideration and that analysis does not support a \nfavorable decision. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                          \n  \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d4 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines.

After\nreviewing the results of Applicant\u2019s background investigation, adjudicators for the\nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) were unable to make a preliminary\naffirmative finding  that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to continue\n1\nApplicant\u2019s access to classified information. On January 26, 2009, DOHA issued to\nApplicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging facts which raise security concerns\nJune 26, 2009\n\n Adjudication of this case is controlled by the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, approved by the President on\n2\nDecember 29, 2005,which were implemented by the Department of Defense on September 1, 2006. Pending\nofficial revision of the Directive, the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines supercede the guidelines listed in\nEnclosure 2 to the Directive.\n See Directive, Enclosure 3, Section E3.1.7. The FORM included eight documents (Items 1 - 8) proffered in\n3\nsupport of the government\u2019s case.\n2\naddressed in the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines (AG)  under Guideline F (financial\n2\nconsiderations).\nOn February 23, 2009, Applicant responded to the SOR, admitted without\nexplanation all of the SOR allegations, and requested a decision without a hearing. On\nMarch 26, 2009, Department Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM)  in\n3\nsupport of the government\u2019s preliminary decision. Applicant received the FORM on April\n13, 2009, and was given 30 days to file a response to the FORM. She did not timely\nrespond to the FORM by the May 13, 2009, deadline. The case was assigned to me on\nJune 17, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nThe government alleged Applicant owed approximately $18,325 for nine\ndelinquent debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.i. In response to the SOR, Applicant admitted\nall of these allegations. In addition to the facts entered in the record through Applicant\u2019s\nadmissions, I make the following findings of relevant fact.\nApplicant is a 40-year-old high school graduate, who has held her current job\nsince July 2005. Before then, she did administrative work for about 11 months through a\ntemporary agency. From about January 2000 until about September 2004, Applicant\nwas a stay-at-home mother and helped with the paperwork for her husband\u2019s\nconstruction company. (FORM, Item 4). Applicant and her husband were married in\nSeptember 1994. It is apparent from the record that they have a child or children, but\nshe did not list them in her e-QIP. In her response to interrogatories, Applicant stated\nthat she and her husband had separated. However, it is not known when this happened\nand there is no available information about the current status of their marriage. Nor has\nApplicant provided any information about financial arrangements such as spousal/child\nsupport or asset and liability allocation. (FORM, Items 4 and 5)\nCredit bureau reports obtained during Applicant\u2019s background investigation\n(FORM, Items 7 and 8) showed that Applicant was delinquent or seriously past due on\nat least 14 debts. Applicant\u2019s response to interrogatories showed that, between January\nand November 2008, she had paid or otherwise resolved at least five of those accounts\ntotaling about $3,476. However, the same credit reports and Applicant\u2019s response to\ninterrogatories show that she still owes the nine debts listed in the SOR. \nApplicant provided a personal financial statement in October 2008, which shows\nthat she has about $300 remaining each month after expenses. However, her expenses\ndo not include payments to any of the remaining delinquencies. There is no information\n\n Directive. 6.3.\n4\n See Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988).\n5\n See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n6\n3\nshowing Applicant has sought assistance from a financial counselor or that she has\nengaged in any systematic effort to repay the debts. Nor is there any information that\nshows how Applicant accrued the debts, which include three unpaid medical accounts\n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b - 1.d), an unpaid satellite TV account (SOR \u00b6 1.a), an unpaid car loan\n(SOR \u00b6 1.I), and four other personal credit accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e - 1.h).\nPolicies\nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense\ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information,\nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the revised\nAdjudicative Guidelines (AG).  Decisions must also reflect consideration of the factors\n4\nlisted in \u00b6 2(a) of the new guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole person\u201d\nconcept, those factor are:\n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not\ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable\nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they\nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified\ninformation. In this case, the pleadings and the information presented by the parties\nrequire consideration of the security concern and adjudicative factors under AG \u00b6 18\n(Guideline F - financial considerations).\nA security clearance decision is intended to resolve whether it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest  for an applicant to either receive or continue to\n5\nhave access to classified information. The government bears the initial burden of\nproducing admissible information on which it based the preliminary decision to deny or\nrevoke a security clearance for an applicant. Additionally, the government must be able\nto prove controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If the government meets its burden, it\nthen falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate or mitigate the government\u2019s case.\nBecause no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security clearance, an applicant bears a heavy\nburden of persuasion.  A person who has access to classified information enters into a\n6\nfiduciary relationship with the government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the\n\n See Egan; Revised Adjudicative Guidelines, \u00b6 2(b).\n7\n4\ngovernment has a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the\nrequisite judgment, reliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national\ninterests as his or her own. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard\ncompels resolution of any reasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in\nfavor of the government.7\nAnalysis\nFinancial Considerations.\nThe security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances, as stated in AG \u00b6 18, is that \n[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nThe government presented sufficient information to support the allegations in the\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a - 1.i. Further, Applicant admitted she owes more than $18,000 for nine\ndelinquent debts. The debts at issue have been unpaid or past due since as long ago as\nDecember 2005. Available information requires application of the disqualifying\nconditions listed at AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and AG \u00b6\n19(c) (a history of not meeting financial obligations).\nIn response, Applicant has presented information that shows Applicant had\nalready acted to pay or resolve some of her delinquent debts several months before\nreceiving DOHA interrogatories and before the SOR was issued. Accordingly, AG \u00b6\n20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts) applies. However, available information also shows she has little money\nleft over each month after paying regular expenses, which do not include payment to\nher remaining debts. Because Applicant did not submit any information about when and\nunder what circumstances the debts arose, neither AG \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened\nso long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely\nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment) or AG \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were\nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g. loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances) is applicable. Also, there is no information\nregarding financial counseling or other actions taken by Applicant to ensure her\nfinances will not be a problem in the future. Thus, AG \u00b6 20(c) is not applicable. Finally,\nbecause it does not appear that Applicant is disputing the validity of any of the debts\nalleged, AG \u00b6 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of\nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to\n\n See footnote 4, supra.\n8\n See footnote 7, supra. \n9\n5\nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the\nissue) does not apply. On balance, Applicant has failed to meet her burden of\npresenting sufficient information to mitigate the security concerns established by the\ngovernment\u2019s information about her finances. \nWhole Person Concept. \nI have evaluated the facts presented and have applied the appropriate\nadjudicative factors under Guideline F. I have also reviewed the record before me in the\ncontext of the whole person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(a). Applicant is 40 years old and\npresumed to be a mature adult. However, the weight of the information presented\nshows she has failed to meet her financial obligations over the past several years.\nThere is no information in this record about any other facet of her background that\nsufficiently counters the adverse information underlying the security concerns about her\nfinances. A fair and commonsense assessment  of all available information bearing on\n8\nApplicant\u2019s finances shows she has failed to address satisfactorily the government\u2019s\ndoubts about her suitability for access to classified information. Because protection of\nthe national interest is paramount in these determinations, such doubts must be\nresolved in favor of the government.9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.I:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is not clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.

Michael Lyles, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLAZZARO, Henry, Administrative Judge:\nApplicant mitigated the security concern that arose from her debts that became\nseverely delinquent following a lengthy period of unemployment.  \nOn October 10, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant stating it was unable to find it is clearly\nDEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE\nDEFENSE OFFICE OF HEARINGS AND APPEALS\nJanuary 21, 2009\n\nThis action was taken under Executive Order 10865, DoD Directive 5220.6, dated January 2, 1992,\n1\nas amended and modified (Directive), DoD Regulation 5200.2-R, dated January 1987, as amended\n(Regulation), and the revised adjudicative guidelines which became effective within the Department of\nDefense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.\n2\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.1\nThe SOR alleges a security concern under Guideline F (financial considerations). Applicant\nsubmitted an answer to the SOR, dated October 24, 2008, in which she admitted all\nallegations except that alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.i. She requested a clearance\ndecision based on the written record without a hearing.  \nDepartment Counsel prepared a File of Relevant Material (FORM) on November 18,\n2008, which was mailed to Applicant on November 24, 2008. Applicant was notified she\nhad 30 days from receipt of the FORM to submit her objections thereto or any additional\ninformation she wanted considered. Applicant acknowledged receipt of the FORM on\nDecember 1, 2008. She submitted a response to the FORM  with numerous attachments\non December 15, 2008. On or about December 29, 2008, Department Counsel indicated\nhe did not object to the admissibility of the materials submitted by Applicant. The case was\nassigned to another administrative judge on January 6, 2009, and reassigned to me on\nJanuary 14, 2009, due to caseload considerations.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant\u2019s admissions to the SOR allegations are incorporated herein. In addition,\nafter a thorough review of the pleadings and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 27-year-old woman who has been employed as a material control\nhandler by a defense contractor since April 2008. She graduated from high school in June\n2000. Applicant worked as a sandwich maker while attending high school and continued\nin that employment until February 2001. She enlisted in the Army reserve in February\n2001, and served on active duty while attending basic training until July 2001. She was\nemployed as an accounting file clerk from July 2001 until May 2002. Applicant served on\nactive duty in the Army from June 2002 until June 2005, and attained the rank of specialist\n(paygrade E-4). \nFrom June 2005 until February 2006, Applicant was unemployed following the birth\nof her child and her release from active military service. She worked as an administrative\nassistant/receiving clerk from February 2006 until July 2007. Applicant quit her job in July\n2007 to accept employment with another company engaged in the same line of work.\nHowever, after she quit her job she discovered someone else had been hired for the\nposition she had anticipated. Applicant was unemployed from July 2007 until she was hired\nby a temporary agency in February 2008. She continued to work for the temporary agency\nuntil she was hired by the defense contractor in April 2008.   \n\n3\nApplicant has been married since October 2003. She has one child who was born\nin January 2005. Applicant\u2019s husband is employed full-time in private industry where he\nearns $18.81 per hour. His net bi-weekly pay is $965.61. Applicant currently earns $20.20\nper hour at her full-time employment. Her net bi-weekly pay is $1,455.47.\nApplicant submitted a detailed monthly and annual budget as part of her response\nto the FORM. The amount of income listed in the budget is consistent with the above\nearnings which are verified by wage statements she submitted for herself and her husband\nas part of her response to the FORM. All estimated recurring living expenses listed in the\nbudgets are reasonable. The budgets include payments on all debts listed in the SOR that\nremain outstanding. The amounts Applicant has budgeted for family living expenses leaves\nher family discretionary annual income in the amount of $7,915.36.   \n \nApplicant\u2019s May 16, 2008 credit report discloses only one account with a negative\nentry prior to her unemployment that began in July 2007. That account, owed in the\namount of $300, is listed as having been submitted for collection in 2004. However, her\nSeptember 15, 2008 credit report shows a settlement was accepted on this account and\nthe account was closed by the credit grantor sometime in or about March 2005. Those\ncredit reports also disclose Applicant always \u201cpaid as agreed\u201d on the many other accounts\nshe had prior to her July 2007 unemployment.   \nThe SOR alleges Applicant has nine accounts, totalling over $30,000, that are\ndelinquent. One of those accounts is alleged to be past due and the remaining accounts\nare alleged to have either been submitted for collection or charged off as bad debts. \nThe account listed in subparagraph 1.a arose when Applicant\u2019s satellite TV service\nwas disconnected in December 2007. She has now returned the TV service company\u2019s\nequipment and paid the balance due on the account. \nThe account listed in subparagraph 1.b became delinquent when Applicant failed\nto cancel her membership at a gym under the mistaken belief the membership would\nautomatically terminate after one year. She has entered into a repayment agreement with\nthe creditor whereby approximately $75 is debited from her bank each month. The amount\nto be paid under the agreement is automatically debited from Applicant\u2019s bank account. \nApplicant has contracted with a credit counselling service to repay a number of her\ndelinquent accounts. Under the terms of the agreement, she is to pay $365.20 per month\nfor 60 months to satisfy the debts listed in subparagraphs 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.g. The\ndebts listed under those subparagraphs arose from delinquent credit card charges and the\ndeficiency that remained after her repossessed vehicle had been sold. The amount to be\npaid under the agreement is also automatically debited from Applicant\u2019s bank account.\nThe account listed in subparagraph 1.h arose from delinquent cell phone charges.\nApplicant has made two payments, totalling $375, toward the $585 balance that was\n\n ISCR Case No. 96-0277 (July 11, 1997) at p. 2.\n2\n ISCR Case No. 97-0016 (December 31, 1997) at p. 3; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.14. \n3\n Department of the Navy v. Egan 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988).\n4\n ISCR Case No. 01-20700 (December 19, 2002) at p. 3 (citations omitted).\n5\n ISCR Case No. 98-0761 (December 27, 1999) at p. 2.\n6\n ISCR Case No. 94-1075 (August 10, 1995) at pp. 3-4; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n7\n ISCR Case No. 93-1390 (January 27, 1995) at pp. 7-8; Directive, Enclosure 3, Item E3.1.15.\n8\n4\nowing. In her response to the FORM, she indicated the remaining balance of $210 would\nbe paid in full by the end of January 2009.\nThe account listed in subparagraph 1.i arose from charges assessed against\nApplicant by a book club she joined. She has satisfied this account in full. \nPolicies\nThe Directive sets forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when evaluating a\nperson\u2019s eligibility to hold a security clearance. Chief among them are the Disqualifying\nConditions (DC) and Mitigating Conditions (MC) for each applicable guideline. Additionally,\neach clearance decision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon\nthe relevant and material facts and circumstances, the whole person concept, and the\nfactors listed in \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive. Although the presence or absence\nof a particular condition or factor for or against clearance is not outcome determinative, the\nadjudicative guidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against this\npolicy guidance. Considering the evidence as a whole, Guideline F (financial\nconsiderations) with its respective DC and MC is most relevant in this case.   \nThe sole purpose of a security clearance decision is to decide if it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for an\napplicant.  The government has the burden of proving controverted facts.  The burden of\n2\n3\nproof in a security clearance case is something less than a preponderance of evidence ,\n4\nalthough the government is required to present substantial evidence to meet its burden of\nproof.  \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a scintilla, but less than a preponderance of the\n5\nevidence.\u201d  Once the government has met its burden, the burden shifts to an applicant to\n6\npresent evidence of refutation, extenuation, or mitigation to overcome the case against him\nor her.  Additionally, an applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a\n7\nfavorable clearance decision.8\n\n Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531.\n9\n Id at 531.\n10\n Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive.\n11\n5\nNo one has a right to a security clearance  and \u201cthe clearly consistent standard\n9\nindicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of\ndenials.\u201d  Any reasonable doubt about whether an applicant should be allowed access to\n10\nclassified information must be resolved in favor of protecting national security.      \n11\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by\nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability,\ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nAs alleged in the SOR, Applicant allowed nine accounts, totalling over $30,000, to\nbecome delinquent. One of those accounts is listed in her credit reports as past due and\nthe remaining accounts have either been submitted for collection or charged off as bad\ndebts. Disqualifying Condition (DC) 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts applies.\nBased on Applicant\u2019s employment and credit history before she became unemployed in\nJuly 2007, I have concluded DC 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations does\nnot apply in this case. \nBasically, Applicant\u2019s financial problems all arose after she became unemployed in\nJuly 2007. Department Counsel asserted in the FORM that Mitigating Condition (MC)\n20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s\ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment . . .), and the individual acted responsibly under the\ncircumstances should not apply in this case because Applicant chose to quit her job in July\n2007 without having secured replacement employment. In her responses to the SOR and\nthe FORM, Applicant indicated she anticipated securing specific replacement employment\nwhen she quit her job in 2007. Considering Applicant\u2019s steady employment history from her\nsenior year in high school until she became unemployed in July 2007, excepting a period\nof about seven months of unemployment shortly after the birth of her child and release\nfrom active duty service in the Army, and her stable credit history up to that time, I find her\nexplanation for the unemployment credible and conclude MC 20(b) applies. For the same\nreason, I conclude MC 20(a): the behavior . . . occurred under such circumstances that it\n\n6\nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment applies.    \nApplicant has fully satisfied two of the debts alleged in the SOR. She has entered\ninto repayment agreements with two other creditors and made payments under those\nagreements that indicate those debts will be satisfied in the near future. Applicant has\ncontracted with a credit counselling service to satisfy the remaining debts through a\nrepayment plan under which the funds are automatically debited from her bank account.\nMost significantly, Applicant submitted detailed monthly and annual budgets with her\nresponse to the FORM that disclose she and her husband have the financial ability to meet\ntheir recurring living expenses, satisfy all their delinquent debts and still have substantial\ndiscretionary income to deal with any unforeseen financial problems they may experience\nin the future. Accordingly, MC 20(c): the person has received or is receiving counseling for\nthe problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control; and 20(d): the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts apply. \nThe objective of the security clearance process is the fair-minded, commonsense\nassessment of a person\u2019s trustworthiness and fitness for access to classified information.\nIndeed, the \u201cwhole person\u201d concept recognizes we should view a person by the totality of\nhis or her acts and omissions. Each case must be adjudged on its own merits, taking into\nconsideration all relevant circumstances, and applying sound judgment, mature thinking,\nand careful analysis.   \nConsidering all relevant and material facts and circumstances present in this case,\nincluding Applicant\u2019s employment and credit history, her military service, her current family\nincome, the period of unemployment that led to her financial problems, the steps she has\ntaken thus far to resolve her delinquent accounts, and the detailed and reasonable budgets\nshe submitted with her response to the FORM, the whole person concept, the factors listed\nin \u00b6 6.3.1 through \u00b6 6.3.6 of the Directive, and the applicable disqualifying and mitigating\nconditions, Applicant has mitigated the security concern that arose from the financial\nconsiderations present in this case. She has overcome the case against her and  satisfied\nher ultimate burden of persuasion. It is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant\nApplicant a security clearance.\n \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - i:\nFor Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.\nEligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                            \nHENRY LAZZARO\nAdministrative Judge\n\n8\nHenry Lazzaro\nAdministrative Judge\n\n",

Applicant is a 62-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and he is seeking to obtain a security clearance, the level of which has not been divulged. Applicant served as an enlisted pipefitter/plumber with the U.S. Navy aboard an aircraft carrier during the mid-1960s. Upon his honorable discharge from active duty, he held a series of jobs with a variety of employers as a journeyman plumber or pipefitter. He has been gainfully employed by the same defense contractor since April 2008, and currently serves as a refrigeration mechanic.2 Applicant has been married to his third and current wife since 2001.3 He and his first two wives have five children, born in 1969, 1970, 1976, 1978, and 1988, respectively.4 2 Id. 3 Id. at 7. 3 Over the years, Applicant has financed and purchased a number of family residences without difficulties.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nGALES, Robert Robinson, Chief Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns regarding financial considerations.  \nEligibility for a security clearance and access to classified information is granted. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn April 24, 2008, Applicant applied for a security clearance and submitted a \nQuestionnaire For Sensitive Positions, Standard Form 86 (SF 86).1 On November 6, \n2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; and \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive). \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and \ndetailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary affirmative finding under the \nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \n \n1 Government Exhibit 1 (SF 86, dated April 24, 2008), at 2. \nFebruary 25, 2009\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nsecurity clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge \nto determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \nIt should be noted that on December 29, 2005, the President promulgated \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified \nInformation, and on August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) \npublished a memorandum directing implementation of those revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines (hereinafter AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under \nthe Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel \nSecurity Program (January 1987), as amended and modified (Regulation), in which the \nSOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.  The AG are applicable to Applicant\u2019s \ncase because his SOR was issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 13, 2008. In a sworn, \nwritten statement, dated November 24, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR \nallegations and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. Department \nCounsel indicated the Government was prepared to proceed on December 8, 2008, and \nthe case was assigned to me on January 26, 2009. A Notice of Hearing was issued on \nFebruary 2, 2009, and I convened the hearing, as scheduled, on February 12, 2009. \n \nDuring the hearing, five Government exhibits and three Applicant exhibits were \nadmitted into evidence without objection. Applicant testified. The transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) was received on February 19, 2009. \n \nThe record was kept open until February 19, 2009, to enable Applicant to \nsupplement the record, but he apparently chose not to do so. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. \nthrough 1.e. of the SOR. \n \nApplicant is a 62-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and he is seeking to \nobtain a security clearance, the level of which has not been divulged.  Applicant served \nas an enlisted pipefitter/plumber with the U.S. Navy aboard an aircraft carrier during the \nmid-1960s.  Upon his honorable discharge from active duty, he held a series of jobs \nwith a variety of employers as a journeyman plumber or pipefitter.  He has been \ngainfully employed by the same defense contractor since April 2008, and currently \nserves as a refrigeration mechanic.2 \n \nApplicant has been married to his third and current wife since 2001.3 He and his \nfirst two wives have five children, born in 1969, 1970, 1976, 1978, and 1988, \nrespectively.4  \n \n2 Id. \n \n3 Id. at 7. \n \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \n \nOver the years, Applicant has financed and purchased a number of family \nresidences without difficulties. In December 2004, he applied for mortgage financing \nfrom Countrywide on a new residence.  He was advised by the lender that he could \nafford the type of mortgage they were offering him,5 so he put $8,000 down6 and \nsecured a mortgage in the amount of $300,000 with an accompanying home equity or \n2nd mortgage in the amount of $75,000, for a total of $375,000.7  Applicant dutifully paid \nhis monthly mortgage of $1,3268 without any difficulty for about two years.9 \n \nAt some point, Applicant noticed that his monthly payment was increasing by \nabout $200 to $300 each month and the equity in his residence was decreasing.  \nEventually, his monthly payment increased to $3,000.10 Because of the difficulty in \npaying that amount, he asked Countrywide to explain what was happening, and was \ninformed that he was in a \u201cnegative interest\u201d situation.  The Countrywide lender advised \nhim to refinance his residence by obtaining another mortgage, but indicated the \nmortgage would have to be issued by a different mortgage lender.11 \n \nFollowing the guidance furnished by Countrywide, in January 2007, Countrywide \ndirected Applicant to American Home, another mortgage lender.12 Following a bank \nappraisal of the property,13 Applicant was issued a mortgage believed to be around \n$535,000, the amount deemed to be what he owed Countrywide.14 He was required to \nfinance an additional $35,000 to $37,000 to match the amount of reduced equity on the \nhouse, as well as for taxes and loan processing.15 The new monthly mortgage payment \nwas $3,200.16 His obligation to Countrywide was satisfied, but his problems just started, \nfor he still could not afford the monthly payments for which he had just been approved \n \n4 Id. at 27. \n \n5 Tr. at 44. \n \n6 Id. at 42. \n \n7 Id. \n \n8 Id. at 44. \n \n9 Id. at 44-45. \n \n10 Id. at 45. \n \n11 Id. at 60-61. \n \n12 Id. at 61. \n \n13 Id. at 64. \n \n14 Id. at 62. \n \n15 Id. at 62, 64-65. \n \n16 Id. \n \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nby American Home.17 When asked why he agreed to take out the new loan he \ncontended he did so because the Countrywide loan officer told him to do so.18  \nApplicant\u2019s sister is much more blunt in her assessment of the situation. She said: he \nwas \u201cduped\u201d by the mortgage companies.19 \n \nSometime thereafter, and unable to make the monthly mortgage payments, \nApplicant sought the assistance of a bankruptcy attorney.  Applicant was advised that \nonce he filed for bankruptcy, he could remain in the house, but that scenario did not feel \nright to him.20 Applicant apparently made some monthly payments, but eventually he \nstopped.  Someone claiming to represent Wells Fargo offered him $1,500 to move out \nof the house.21 He accepted the offer and relocated. \n \nTitle to the property subsequently passed to Citi Mortgage, and they foreclosed \non it,22 leaving a deficiency of $130,500. According to a recent credit report, the Citi23 \nMortgage account balance is zero, and the account is closed. \n \nApplicant and his wife now reside in a trailer.  Each week their net salary is about \n$1,574.24 With the exception of the purported mortgage deficiency, all their other \naccounts and expenses are now current.25 \n \nThe SOR identified five purportedly continuing delinquencies, including the \nmortgage deficiency.  Applicant contends three of them have been satisfied, and one is \nbeing addressed.  Those five debts listed in the SOR, and their respective purported \ncurrent status, according the credit reports, financial records and correspondence, as \nwell as Applicant\u2019s comments regarding same, are described below: \n \n17 Id. \n \n18 Id. at 62-63. \n \n19 Id. at 76. \n \n20 Id. at 47. \n \n21 Id. at 47-48, 66. \n \n22 Government Exhibit 2 (Combined Credit Report, dated May 6, 2008), at 8. \n \n23 Government Exhibit 5 (Equifax Credit Report, dated February 7, 2009), at 2. \n \n24 Tr. at 49. \n \n25 Id. at 51. \n \n\n \n5 \n                                      \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 \nTYPE DEBT \nAMOUNT \nSTATUS \n1.a. \nCable television \n$226 \nCollection \nApr \n2008. \nAmount \ncorrected \nand \npaid Dec 2008. \n1.b. \nMedical \n$41 \nCollection \nFeb \n2008. \nInsurance error.

He was \nassured he was \u201cup to par\u201d and had a zero balance.  He never received another bill.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nAn Administrative Judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nAdministrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of \na number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge \nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d35 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive. Once the Government has \nproduced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe Applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, \nexplanation, extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the \nGovernment\u2019s case.  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. \n \n \n32 Id. at 37-39. \n \n33 Id. at 38. \n \n34 Id. at 39. \n \n35 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, \n2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \n\n \n7 \n                                      \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as \nwell. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to \nrepose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants \naccess to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d Accordingly, nothing in this Decision should be construed to \nsuggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied \ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. . . . \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly, under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns as well. The evidence is sufficient to establish AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). \n \nApplicant has been gainfully employed since before his financial difficulty began.  \nIntending to purchase a new family residence, Applicant sought guidance from the \nunion representative and was directed to Countrywide where he presented his financial \nbackground as part of his application for the mortgage loan. Unfortunately, a \ncombination of circumstances subsequently served him poorly, and after two years of \npaying his mortgage, he found himself unable to continue to do so. His interest rate rose \nrapidly and his monthly payment went from $1,326 to $3,000.  He was unable to pay his \nmortgage, and eventually, was induced to abandon the residence to foreclosure. \n \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nI am mindful of the four other rather miniscule debts, but do not consider them \npart of a pattern.  Two of those debts were the result of billing errors; one was caused \nby a creditor\u2019s refusal to submit the claim to the insurance company within the required \ntimeframe; and his cable television bill resulted from a computer glitch. Moreover, those \nfour debts have either been paid off or are in the process of being so. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial considerations. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying \ncondition may be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ is \npotentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the \nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts.@36 Also, AG & 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to \ndispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and \nprovides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence \nof actions to resolve the issue\u201d may apply. \n \nAs noted above, the normal overriding concern pertaining to financial \nconsiderations in the security clearance context is that \u201c[f]ailure or inability to live within \none\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations. . . .\u201d \n(emphasis supplied).  But these are not \u201cnormal\u201d times, for the world in general, and the \nUnited States in particular, is faced with economic chaos, plummeting real estate \nvalues, tightened credit, corporate layoffs and bankruptcies, diminished savings and \nretirement accounts, financial institution failures and takeovers, and soaring \nunemployment.  \n   \nWe no longer think in terms of millions or even billions of dollars when describing \ndeficits, for in this new world order, trillions of dollars have become the new standard.  \nWe are in economic turmoil, with posturing and corporate greed running rampant; where \ncredit is unavailable; where thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of otherwise \n \n36 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must present \nevidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith \naction aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person \nacts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 \nAccordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \n\u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case \nNo. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \ninnocent bystanders have become victims by losing their homes to foreclosure and their \njobs to these uncertain times; and where the popular responses are to point the fingers \nof blame and throw unprecedented amounts of money, characterized as \u201cstimulus\u201d \nfunds, into the abyss with the hope of success.  \n   \nThis economic catastrophe appears to be the \u201cperfect storm\u201d where the \nconfluence of greed, irresponsible risk-taking, regulatory failure and inadequate \noversight, malfeasance, misfeasance, and nonfeasance on the part of some segments \nof corporate America, our financial institutions, and political institutions, has resulted in \nunintentional consequences or \u201ccollateral damage\u201d to the innocents.  In the past, these \nunconscionable actions were overlooked in the race for enrichment.   \n   \nTo determine if an applicant is such an unintentional victim or a willing participant \nand complicit, in an otherwise unwise or irresponsible monetary scheme, or a person \nwith poor self-control or lack of judgment, an analysis of the individual\u2019s original \nintentions and actions is necessary. In this instance, Applicant\u2019s financial history and \nactions reveals no evidence of poor self-control, lack of judgment, or a willingness to \nabide by rules and regulations. To the contrary, Applicant\u2019s current situation was caused \nby other factors, including his gullibility in relying on the guidance of apparently \nknowledgeable but unscrupulous mortgage lenders.  \n   \nAware of Applicant\u2019s inability to pay the monthly mortgage payments to \nCountrywide, that institution, nevertheless, urged him to refinance with another \nmortgage lender, increasing his debt and eventual monthly payment, seemingly to get \nhim off their books to recoup the entire mortgage liability he owed Countrywide. \nLikewise, when American Home appraised his residence and found he qualified for an \neven higher mortgage, although the real estate value of his home had already \nplummeted to less than his Countrywide mortgage, they should have anticipated the \nresult.  It was evident that he could not afford the new mortgage, for he did not lie or \nrepresent his financial status in his application for the mortgage. It was seemingly \nanother example of corporate greed and a disregard of lending guidelines. \n \nWhile the foreclosure did take place, and there was apparently a deficiency of \nabout $130,000, the evidence now indicates there is a zero balance.37 Considering the \nunusual circumstances of today\u2019s economy in general, and the series of events \ninvolving Applicant\u2019s mortgage loans in particular; Applicant\u2019s actions with regard to the \nother four relatively minor debts; and the fact that he otherwise continues to maintain a \ngood financial relationship with his credit union of over 30 years, there are clear \nindications that Applicant\u2019s financial issue has been resolved and is now largely under \ncontrol.  The evidence establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c), 20(d), and 20(e), and partially 20(a) \n \n37 The law in some states provides that upon foreclosure, unless a judicial action is taken within certain time \nlimits, a debt is resolved and the debtor has no continuing financial liability. See ISCR Case No. 07-12807 at 7 (Apr. \n30, 2008) where-in I discuss the relevant statute of limitations pertaining to deficiencies. \n  \n \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nbecause the circumstances are unusual and unlikely to recur, and do not cast doubt on \nhis reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant met with a mortgage \nlender at Countrywide where he presented his financial background as part of his \napplication for the mortgage loan. He was qualified for a particular loan, and it was \ngranted to him. After making his monthly payments for about two years, he found that \nthe required payments had risen to much higher unanticipated levels, and sought \nassistance in resolving the potential problem. He was directed to another mortgage \nlender at American Home where he again qualified for a mortgage loan of an amount in \nexcess of the residence value and the payments were even higher than before. He soon \nfound himself unable to continue to pay his monthly mortgage payments. Applicant had \nto eventually abandon the residence to foreclosure.  (See AG && 2(a)(1), 2(a)(2), \n2(a)(5), and 2(a)(7).)  \n \nOf course, the issue is not simply whether all his debts are resolved; it is whether \nhis financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. \nI am mindful that while any one factor, considered in isolation, might put Applicant\u2019s \ncredit history in a sympathetic light, I have evaluated the various aspects of this case in \nlight of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal \nanalysis.38 Considering the circumstances behind the mortgage loans given to him by \nthe mortgage lenders, his employment history, his otherwise outstanding reputation, the \n \n38 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. \nBd. Jun. 2, 2006) \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \ndecline in real estate values, and his continuing good-faith efforts, the security concerns \nare mitigated. (See AG && 2(a)(1), 2(a)(8), and 2(a)(9).)   \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is  \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

His eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nApplicant completed and signed an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations \nProcessing (e-QIP) on May 7, 2008. He was interviewed about his financial issues by \nan authorized investigator from the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on \nJune 19, 2008. On October 6, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) issued Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and \nFebruary 23, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \nthe revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn November 6, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR in writing and elected to \nhave a hearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on \nDecember 16, 2008. I convened a hearing on January 26, 2009, to consider whether it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance \nfor Applicant. The Government called no witnesses and introduced seven exhibits, \nwhich were marked Exs. 1 through 7 and admitted to the record without objection.  \nApplicant testified on his own behalf and called no witnesses. He introduced five \nexhibits, which were marked as Exs. A through E and admitted to the record without \nobjection. \n \nAt the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open until close of business on \nFebruary 5, 2009, so that Applicant could, if he wished, provide additional information \nfor the record. Applicant timely filed seven additional exhibits, which I marked as Exs. F \nthrough L. Department Counsel objected to the admission of Exs. G, H, and I on the \ngrounds of relevancy. I sustained the Government\u2019s objections and did not admit those \nexhibits. Applicant\u2019s Exs. F, J, K, and L were admitted to the record without objection. \nDOHA received the transcript (Tr.) of the hearing on February 2, 2009. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nThe SOR contains eight allegations of disqualifying conduct under AG F, \nFinancial Considerations. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.h.) In his Answer to the SOR, \nApplicant admitted five allegations and denied three. Applicant\u2019s admissions are \nincluded herein as findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 39 years old and employed by a government contractor. He seeks a \nsecurity clearance. (Ex. 1; Ex. 7; Tr. 19, 25-27.) \n \n \nApplicant and his wife have been married for 5 \u00bd years. They have no children, \nbut Applicant recently paid approximately $1,500 in medical bills for the child of his god-\ndaughter. Applicant\u2019s wife is employed by a federal agency. Applicant\u2019s net monthly \nincome is approximately $3,100. His wife\u2019s net monthly income is $3,600.  (Ex. J; Tr. 32, \n53-54, 63-64.) \n \n \nIn 1993, Applicant received an associate\u2019s degree in business management. In \n1996, he was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree in sociology. From 1996 to 1997, \nApplicant attended law school at an institution in the Midwest. At the end of that year, he \ntransferred to another law school in the Mid-Atlantic region, where he attended for one \nyear. He needs to complete six courses to finish his law degree. He estimates that he \nwill need to attend law school for another year or two to receive his degree. (Ex. 1; Tr. \n57-60.) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                           \n \nApplicant served in the U.S. military as a reservist from 1988 to 1996. Since \ncompleting his undergraduate education, he has pursued a number of career paths.  \nFrom September 1999 through June 2005, he was employed as a public school \nteacher.1 From 2003 to 2004, he also had his own business as a home inspector. From \nJanuary 2004 until July 2006, he worked as a real estate salesperson. From 2006 to \n2008, he worked on commission for a business that refinanced home mortgages. \nBecause of the decline in the housing industry, he experienced financial hardship and \nunderemployment in 2007 as a consequence of his mortgage refinancing job. Applicant \nhas worked for his present employer since May 2008. (Ex. 1; Tr. 32-37, 53-55.)  \n \n \nApplicant admits responsibility for approximately $75,000 in federal education \ndebt which is currently in collection or default status. These debts are alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.c., 1.d., 1.e., and 1.f. After acquiring these education debts to finance his \nundergraduate education and his law school studies, Applicant made some sporadic \nloan repayments in the late 1990s or early 2000s. The loans were in default when he \nbegan to teach in 1999. They are currently in default status. The creditor demands an \n$800 monthly payment on the outstanding education debt.  Applicant asserts he cannot \nafford to pay $800 a month and has proposed a $450 monthly payment. Applicant and \nthe creditor have not yet agreed upon a payment plan and schedule.  Applicant plans to \nnegotiate a plan to repay his delinquent student loans in the future. (Ex. A; Ex. B; Ex. C; \nEx. D; Ex. K; Tr. 15-18, 57, 67-68, 71-74.) \n \n \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant was responsible for two delinquent debts to a \ncommunications firm.  One debt was for $205 (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) and the other was for $403 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b.). Applicant denied both debts and stated they had been paid in full in \n2002/2003. He contacted the creditor to request documentation to corroborate his \nstatement that the debts had been paid. The creditor responded with a request that \nApplicant pay the debts, and if they had been paid previously, the creditor would issue a \nrefund. Applicant stated he had initiated a formal complaint with the creditor and was \nawaiting a reply. Applicant\u2019s credit report of September 15, 2008 shows both accounts \nin collection status. Applicant failed to provide documentation to corroborate payment or \nto corroborate his formal complaint. (Answer to SOR at 1; Ex. 4; Tr. 38.)   \n \n \nThe SOR alleged Applicant had failed to satisfy a judgment in the amount $2,984 \nwhich had been levied against Applicant for a debt resulting from the repossession of an \nautomobile. (SOR \u00b6 1.g.) Applicant denied the debt, stated that it had been satisfied, \nand provided documentation to corroborate satisfaction of the debt. (Ex. E.) \n \n \nThe SOR also alleged that Applicant was responsible to a bank for a $1,566 \ndebt, in collection status, and, as of May 14, 2008, the debt had not been paid. (SOR \u00b6 \n1.h.)  The debt arose when Applicant overdrew his debit account. He attributed his lack \nof funds to underemployment. In a post-hearing submission, Applicant provided an offer \nof settlement from the creditor. In a letter to Applicant, dated February 3, 2009, the \ncreditor offered to settle the debt for $627.06, provided that Applicant submitted three \n \n1 Applicant\u2019s e-QIP lists his employment as a teacher as four years, from 2000 to 2004.  (Ex. 1 at 14.)  \n\n \n4 \n \n \npayments of $209.12 by the 15th day of February, March, and April, 2009. There were \nno documents in the record corroborating that any of these payments had been made \nby the time the record closed.  (Ex. L; Tr. 40-42.) \n \n \nIn March 2007, Applicant and his wife purchased a home. Their monthly \nmortgage payment is $2,972. At his hearing, Applicant stated that he had purchased a \nused automobile in December 2008 and had a monthly car payment of $216. (Tr. 47-\n50.)  \n \n \nBefore their marriage in 2003, Applicant and his wife had consumer credit \ncounseling as individuals. They subscribe to an on-line credit-monitoring service to help \nthem manage their joint finances. They have not had had formal credit counseling as a \ncouple. (Tr. 51-53.) \n \n \nAs a post hearing submission, Applicant provided a copy of his household \nbudget. The budget did not list his monthly car payment. Applicant\u2019s budget shows that \nafter paying his monthly living expenses and current debts, Applicant has a net monthly \nremainder of over $1,500.  (Ex. J.)   \n \n \n                                                  Policies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the  \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, the administrative judge applies these guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \nover-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n\n \n5 \n \n \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated substantial delinquent debt and was unable to \npay his creditors. This evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying \nconditions. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Several Guideline F mitigating conditions \ncould apply to the security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s financial delinquencies. \nUnresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if it \u201chappened so long ago, was so \ninfrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \n\n \n6 \n \n \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d \n(AG \u00b6 20(a)). Additionally, unresolved financial delinquency might be mitigated if \u201cthe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s \ncontrol, (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.\u201d  (AG \u00b6 20(b)). Still other mitigating circumstances that might \nbe applicable include evidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling \nfor the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or \nis under control\u201d (AG \u00b6 20(c) or \u201cthe individual initiated a good faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d (AG \u00b6 20 (d)). Finally, security concerns \nrelated to financial delinquencies might be mitigated if \u201cthe individual has a reasonable \nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem \nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d (AG \u00b6 20 (e)).   \n \nApplicant=s student loan delinquencies arose in the 1990s and have remained \nunresolved even though, until recently, he had reliable full-time employment. Appellant\u2019s \nlarge unresolved student debt raises security concerns which continue to the present \nday, a situation which raises concerns about Applicant\u2019s good judgment.   \n \nApplicant, who was employed in mortgage refinancing, experienced financial \nuncertainties in the last year or eighteen months because of the downturn in the \nnational housing market. At the same time, he and his wife purchased a home, and their \nmonthly mortgage payment equals his net monthly take-home pay. Even so, they have \norganized their financial life to remain solvent. Additionally, Applicant helped a family \nmember who needed money to pay for health care for a sick child. \n \nApplicant has made some efforts to work out a payment plan for his student loan \ndebt. However, he had not yet made a commitment to begin regular and consistent \npayment. He provided documentation to corroborate his payment of one debt. He failed \nto provide documentation to corroborate his statement that he had contested two debts \nand initiated payment of another. Despite some good faith efforts to pay some of his \ndebts, Applicant has not demonstrated a track record of timely payments. It is not clear \nthat he will be able to manage his finances and avoid financial delinquency in the   \nfuture. Curiously, he has not set aside money to meet his student loan delinquencies, \ndespite his substantial monthly net remainder. I conclude that AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), 20(d), and \n20(e) apply in part in mitigation, but that AG \u00b6 20(a) and AG \u00b6 20(c) do not apply in \nmitigation to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s financial problems began \nmore than ten years ago, when he was a mature adult. He did not address $75,000 in \ndelinquent student loans even though he was steadily employed. His failure to address \nthese substantial delinquencies over a significant period of time raises concerns about \nhis judgment and reliability. \n \nTo his credit, Applicant has taken recent action to address some of his \ndelinquencies. However, these actions are recent and do not demonstrate a track \nrecord of satisfaction of debt consistently over time.  \n \nApplicant can reapply for a security clearance one year after the date that this \ndecision becomes final. If he wishes, he can produce new evidence that addresses the \nGovernment\u2019s current security concerns.    \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts at the present \ntime as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from his \nfinancial delinquencies.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST  APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.f.: Against Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g.:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h.:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On December 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline F (financial considerations) for Applicant. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), \nas amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by \nthe President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense \nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nAugust 17, 2009\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 8, 2009. Department \nCounsel was prepared to proceed on May 18, 2009. On May 21, 2009, the case was \nassigned to me. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 30, 2009, scheduling the \nhearing for June 10, 2009. The hearing was held as scheduled. \n \nThe government offered Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were \nreceived without objection. The Applicant offered Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through Z, \nwhich were received without objection, and testified on his own behalf.   \n \nI held the record open until June 22, 2009 to afford the Applicant the \nopportunity to submit additional evidence on his behalf. Applicant timely submitted AE \nAA through EE, which were received without objection. DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on June 17, 2009.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. His admissions are accepted as \nfindings of fact. \n \nApplicant is a 33-year-old associate engineer senior employed by a defense \ncontractor since March 2003, GE 1, Tr. 14, 16. He has successfully held a secret \nsecurity clearance since April 2002. He seeks to retain his security clearance to \nenhance and maintain the flexibility to work on different projects. Also, he is required \nto have a security clearance for his current long-term project. Tr. 16-17, 74, GE 1.  \n \nApplicant graduated from high school in May 1994, and graduated from college \nin December 1998 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Computer Science Information \nSystems. GE 1, AE E, AE F, Tr. 15. He married in July 1999. He and his wife have two \nsons, ages eight and four. Tr. 14-15, GE 1, AE A. \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed his financial situation and \nincluded the review of his April 2008 e-QIP; his May 2008 and December 2008 credit \nbureau reports; and his October 2008 Response to DOHA Financial Interrogatories. \nGE 1 - 4.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR identified six separate line items, four of which were debts \ntotaling $57,461. The two remaining items reflect a home foreclosure and a Personal \nFinancial Statement identifying income insufficient to meet monthly expenses. As \nnoted supra, Applicant admitted all allegations, which are further corroborated by the \ngovernment\u2019s evidence. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.f., Response to SOR, GE 1 - 4. \n \nApplicant attributes his financial problems to a loss of dual income. Applicant\u2019s \nwife was working as loan processer in 2005, and with their combined income, they \nearned $104,664. With the decline of the housing market in 2006, Applicant\u2019s wife was \ndemoted and left her job with the goal of finding a comparable or better job in an \nattempt to regain her former income level. Her efforts were unsuccessful and their \n\n \n3 \n \n \ncombined income decreased in 2006 to $95,534. In 2007, Applicant\u2019s wife earned her \nreal estate license with the goal of selling one house a month, which she calculated \nwould approximate the income she lost when she was demoted. Her new-found \ncareer as a real estate agent failed to generate income as the housing market \ncontinued to \u201cbottom out.\u201d Their combined annual income declined even further in \n2007 to $60,831. Tr. 22-24, AE H, AE I. \n \nWith the loss of income, Applicant and his wife were unable to remain current \non their house payments and monthly bills. As the housing market continued to \ndecline, their house eventually became \u201cupside down.\u201d Using her real estate license, \nApplicant\u2019s wife unsuccessfully tried to sell their home on a short sale. In January \n2008, their home went into foreclosure and the bank took possession of it. Their home \neventually did sell at auction for $374,000 in April 2008 \u2013 Applicant and his wife \noriginally paid $489,000 for their home in January 2006. Tr. 24-25, AE I, AE J, AE K, \nAE L. Applicant left his home in good order following foreclosure. Tr. 25, AE M.  \n \nDuring this time, Applicant\u2019s wife began experiencing medical problems of a \nneurological nature. In 2008, she sought treatment for this condition 66 times. During \nthe first five months of 2009, she sought medical treatment 25 times. Tr. 26-27, AE N, \nAE O. In early 2008, Applicant\u2019s wife filed a social security disability claim claiming she \nhad a displaced disc in the neck, complex regional pain syndrome, two fractured feet, \ndepression, migraines, rapid heart beat, high cholesterol, and anxiety. In October \n2007, the Social Security Administration denied her claim. Tr. 27-28, AE P. Applicant\u2019s \nwife retained counsel to appeal her disability claim denial. Her counsel filed an appeal \nin November 2008, and a decision is currently pending. Tr. 28-29, AE Q, AE R. \n \nThroughout this entire process, Applicant and his wife maintained regular \ncontact with their creditors, which is documented. They advised their creditors of their \nsituation, and attempted to negotiate alternate payment arrangements. In 2008, they \nretained the services of a debt consolidation company for about four months, and \ndiscovered to their disappointment, that the debt consolidation company had not \ncontacted their creditors. Tr. 29-34, GE 2. In October 2008, Applicant and his wife \nsought counsel with a bankruptcy attorney and decided to file chapter 13 bankruptcy. \nApplicant made a hardship withdrawal from his 401k account to pay his bankruptcy \nattorney fees. In December 2008, Applicant\u2019s attorney filed a chapter 13 petition. In \nJanuary 2009, Applicant began making payments to the bankruptcy trustee and \nremains current on his payments. All four debts listed in the SOR are included on \nApplicant\u2019s chapter 13 Schedule F \u2013 Creditors Holding Unsecured Nonpriority Claims. \nThe total amount of claims itemized on Applicant\u2019s Schedule F is $106,118.20. Tr. 34-\n46, GE 2, AE S, AE T, AE V, AE AA, AE BB. \n \nApplicant completed the mandatory financial counseling that accompanies the \nbankruptcy process. He submitted a Certificate of Debtor Education dated May 31, \n2009. Tr. 38-39, AE U. Applicant\u2019s Schedule J \u2013 Current Expenditures of Individual \nDebtor(s) reflects a net monthly remainder of $26.55, and a monthly rent of $1,438 \n(first rental property was $1,895). However, he has since reduced his monthly rent to \n\n \n4 \n \n \n$1,200 by moving to a less expensive property. Tr. 46-48, AE X, AE W, AE X, AE Y, \nAE BB. Applicant\u2019s monthly budget reflects that he is living within his means and has \ntaken reasonable, responsible and measured steps to reduce expenses. Tr. 48-50, AE \nZ. \n \nThree witnesses testified on behalf of the Applicant. Two witnesses were work-\nrelated, his supervisor and a co-worker. They both hold security clearances, have \nknown the Applicant since he began working for the company, and observe him on a \ndaily basis. They both confirmed he is truthful, honest, hard working, is making a \ncontribution to the defense industry, and recommended him for a security clearance. \nTr. 69-82. His third witness was his neighbor, whose family interacts with Applicant \nand his family two-to-three times a week. He testified Applicant is trustworthy and \ndependable. His trust in Applicant is such that he depends on him to watch his house \nwhile gone and allows his children to go to Applicant\u2019s house without an escort. Tr. 83-\n87. \n \nApplicant provided his annual performance evaluations from 2006 to 2008. The \nevaluations document his valuable service to the defense industry, and how he \nconsistently meets or exceeds employer expectations. AE CC, AE DD, AE EE. His \nperformance was such that he has consistently received merit increases since 2004. \nAE G. Applicant submitted a perfect attendance award from high school, and a letter \nfrom a woman to his grocery store employer while in high school. The letter \ncommends Applicant for turning in her wallet after finding it in a shopping cart. \nContained in the wallet was a large sum of cash that was her son\u2019s missionary money. \nThe same woman also wrote a letter to the local newspaper bringing Applicant\u2019s \nhonesty to the attention of the community. Tr. 19-20, AE B, AE C, AE C. \n \nPolicies \n \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the \nExecutive Branch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security \nemphasizing, \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander-in-Chief, the President has the \nauthority to control access to information bearing on national security and to determine \nwhether an individual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. \nat 527. The President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to \ngrant an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended \nand modified.    \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the Applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \n\n \n5 \n \n \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable.  \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. Clearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  \nSee Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism.  \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the Applicant that may disqualify the Applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The government has the \nburden of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at \n531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  \nSee v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The \nguidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any \nof the criteria listed therein and an Applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. \n95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).      \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the Applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate \nthe facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An Applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the government. See ISCR Case No. \n02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should \nerr, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n  \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence and after applications of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, I conclude the relevant security \nconcern is under Guideline F (financial considerations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the \nsecurity concern relating to financial considerations: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n\n \n6 \n \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and (c) a \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d The government established these \nconditions through Applicant\u2019s admissions and evidence presented. \n \n \nFour conditions under AG \u00b6 20 may mitigate security concerns and are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), \nand \nthe \nindividual \nacted \nresponsibly \nunder \nthe \ncircumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; and \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts. \nAll of the mitigating conditions supra fully apply. Up until Applicant and his wife \nbecame victims of the recent downturn in the economy, they were current on their \nmonthly bills and living within their means. Applicant\u2019s financial problems began in \n2006 when his wife was demoted. This triggering event and her inability to find a \ncomparable replacement job were not of her own doing. These events are unlikely to \nrecur and do not cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s \u201ccurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.\u201d  \n \nConcomitant with Applicant\u2019s wife losing her job, she began to experience \nhealth problems of a neurological nature. She incurred health problems prompting 66 \ndoctor visits in 2008 and 25 doctor visits in the first five months of 2009. She filed a \ndisability claim with the Social Security Administration in early 2008, which was \ndenied, and is pending appeal. Applicant submitted documentation of his efforts to \nkeep the lines of communication open with their creditors throughout this entire \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \nprocess. Applicant and his wife underwent the painful process of losing their home, \nkeeping the lender fully apprised of their situation, and upon foreclosure left their \nhome in good repair. These facts warrant application of AGs \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b). \n \nFeeling overwhelmed and frustrated following a bad experience with a debt \nconsolidation company, Applicant sought counsel with a bankruptcy attorney. The \nbankruptcy attorney advised him to seek protection under chapter 13. Applicant filed \nhis petition in December 2008, and his repayment plan became effective in January \n2009. He remains current on his repayment plan and has a budget and lifestyle \ncommensurate with his current income. Applicant completed the required financial \ncounseling associated with filing chapter 13, and is making a good-faith effort to repay \nhis creditors through his repayment plan. He is committed to maintaining and \nachieving financial responsibility and has his finances under control. He is continually \nlooking for ways to reduce his monthly expenses. AGs \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) fully apply.  \n \nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. Applicant met his ultimate \nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. I also gave \nconsiderable weight to his service in the defense industry, his seven years of \nsuccessfully holding a secret clearance, his honesty and integrity, dedication to his \nfamily, and sincere desire to resolve his debts honorably and responsibly. In reaching \nthis conclusion, I gave the whole person concept due consideration and that analysis \ndoes support a favorable decision. \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d1 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the adjudicative \nprocess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude \nhe is eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. through f.: \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n1 See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).  \n\n \n8 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Clearance is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nROBERT J. TUIDER \nAdministrative Judge \n",

In 1980, she received a liberal arts degree. She served in the U.S. Army from 1985 to 1988. After leaving the Army, she began working for her current employer in September 1988. She is a site administrative aide. She has held a Top Secret security clearance since 2003. (Item 4) In May 2008, Applicant completed an e-QIP. In it, she disclosed two debts that were more than 180 and 90 days delinquent. One debt is an automobile loan and another debt is a credit card. She indicated that the debts became delinquent because of a reduction in household income. (Item 4 at 30) Only the delinquent automobile loan is alleged in the SOR. In November 2005, Applicant co-signed the automobile loan with her husband. In September 2007, she was unable to keep up payments because her husband\u2019s salary was reduced due to a decrease in church income. Subsequently, she and her husband paid some church expenses, which affected their family budget.

She served in the U.S. Army from 1985 to 1988. \nAfter leaving the Army, she began working for her current employer in September 1988. \nShe is a site administrative aide. She has held a Top Secret security clearance since \n2003. (Item 4) \n \n \nIn May 2008, Applicant completed an e-QIP. In it, she disclosed two debts that \nwere more than 180 and 90 days delinquent. One debt is an automobile loan and \nanother debt is a credit card. She indicated that the debts became delinquent because \nof a reduction in household income. (Item 4 at 30) Only the delinquent automobile loan \nis alleged in the SOR. \n \n \nIn November 2005, Applicant co-signed the automobile loan with her husband. In \nSeptember 2007, she was unable to keep up payments because her husband\u2019s salary \nwas reduced due to a decrease in church income. Subsequently, she and her husband \npaid some church expenses, which affected their family budget. (Item 7 at 7) According \nto the October 2008 credit bureau report (CBR), the loan was charged off in the amount \nof $27,336. \n \n \nIn her Answer, Applicant stated that she resolved the debt with the creditor with a \npayment agreement. (Item 3) As of March 27, 2009, the balance of the debt was \n$22,905, indicating that Applicant had paid or resolved $4,400 of the debt since the \ncharge off. (Id. at 6) She submitted an exhibit documenting a payment of $600 on March \n30, 2009. (Id. at 4) She made additional payments of $600 on April 30, 2009 and on \nMay 29, 2009, bringing down the balance to $21,510. (AE A through C) \n \n \nApplicant submitted a copy of her budget as of December 2008. She and her \nhusband have a net monthly income of $5,710 and expenses of $4,350. She pays \n\n \n3 \n \n \n$1,120 on financial obligations, including the automobile loan, leaving her approximately \n$240 remaining at the end of the month for other matters. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common-sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. According to Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant \nis responsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has \nthe ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions adverse to an \napplicant shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order \n\n \n4 \n \n \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nAG & 19 sets forth nine conditions that could raise security concerns, two of \nwhich are potentially disqualifying in this case:  \n \n(a) an inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \nBased on a CBR and her admission, Applicant accumulated a large debt that \nbegan accruing in 2007, which she was previously unable or unwilling to satisfy until \nlate 2008. The evidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions.  \n \nAfter the Government raised potential disqualifications, the burden shifted to \nApplicant to rebut and prove mitigation of the resulting security concerns. The guideline \nincludes six examples of conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \nfinancial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts;  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income.   \n \nThe SOR alleged one delinquent debt that arose in September 2007 when \nApplicant\u2019s household income decreased as a result of a reduction of her husband\u2019s \nsalary and their assumption of some church expenses. Those appear to be isolated and \nunusual circumstances and do not cast doubt on her reliability or good judgment. \nHence, AG \u00b6 2 (a) has some application. Although, those circumstances were beyond \nher control there is no evidence that she began addressing the delinquency until late \n2008, which evidence is necessary for the full application of AG & 20(b). \n \nApplicant presented evidence that she established a repayment plan for the debt \ncontained in SOR \u00b6 1.a, and is making monthly payments on the debt. Since October \n2008, she has paid $5,826 on the loan. Hence, she made a good-faith effort to resolve \nthe debt and the situation appears to be under control, triggering the application of AG & \n20(c) and AG & 20(d). There is no evidence to support the application of AG & 20(e) or \nAG & 20(f).  \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common-sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 57 years old and has \nworked for a federal contractor for over 19 years. Prior to that, she served in the U.S. \nArmy for three years. Only one debt is alleged in the SOR and it arose because of \neconomic difficulties she and her husband experienced in 2007. She took responsibility \nfor repayment of the automobile loan and began resolving it in late 2008, prior to the \nissuance of the SOR. According to her budget, she has sufficient money to pay the \ndebt. Based on her awareness of the effect that financial delinquencies could have on \nher employment and her actions to resolve the delinquent obligation, I do not believe \nsimilar problems will recur in the future. There is no other adverse information in the \nrecord file. Overall, the record evidence leaves me without doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns arising from her financial issues.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n                                           \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",
