    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 49-year-old, married man with two children ages 23 and 17. His first marriage ended in divorce in 2002 after a two-year separation. He married his current wife later that year. In 2000, Applicant retired from the U.S. Army after 24 years of service. He served the first nine years in active duty, and retired as a sergeant first-class (E-7). He has an associate\u2019s degree in theology, and is currently working toward a bachelor\u2019s degree in theology and business (Tr. 20). Applicant works for a defense contractor as a logistics specialist. His duties involve testing, issuing, and distributing communications data to the armed services (Id.).

Since 1999, Applicant has accrued eight financial delinquencies, as listed in the SOR, in the approximate amount of $26,000. Approximately $19,300, as alleged in SOR subparagraph 1.g, represents a tax lien for tax years 1999 and 2001. Through the 1990s, Applicant and his first wife filed joint income taxes.

The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President\non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs\nissued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 10, 2008, and requested a hearing. The\ncase was assigned to me on April 10, 2008. On April 30, 2008, a hearing was\nscheduled for May 29, 2008. During the hearing, which was held as scheduled, I\nreceived five government exhibits, 20 Applicant exhibits, marked A through T, and the\ntestimony of Applicant. At the close of the hearing, I left the record open at Applicant\u2019s\nrequest to allow him to submit additional exhibits. Within the time allotted, he submitted\nJuly 11, 2008\n\nAs Applicant and his first wife grew estranged, they increasingly failed to communicate with one another.\n1\n2\nanother exhibit, which I incorporated into the record. The transcript was received on\nJune 16, 2008. Based upon a review of the record, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 49-year-old, married man with two children ages 23 and 17. His\nfirst marriage ended in divorce in 2002 after a two-year separation. He married his\ncurrent wife later that year.\nIn 2000, Applicant retired from the U.S. Army after 24 years of service. He served\nthe first nine years in active duty, and retired as a sergeant first-class (E-7). He has an\nassociate\u2019s degree in theology, and is currently working toward a bachelor\u2019s degree in\ntheology and business (Tr. 20).\nApplicant works for a defense contractor as a logistics specialist. His duties\ninvolve testing, issuing, and distributing communications data to the armed services\n(Id.).\nApplicant works part-time as an assistant minister for a local church. Also, he\nmentors troubled youth that are referred to him by the local court system, attempting to\n\u201cdevelop them from boyhood to manhood to try to assist them into just doing the right\nthings within the community\u201d (Tr. 62). \nSince 1999, Applicant has accrued eight financial delinquencies, as listed in the\nSOR, in the approximate amount of $26,000. Approximately $19,300, as alleged in SOR\nsubparagraph 1.g, represents a tax lien for tax years 1999 and 2001. Through the\n1990s, Applicant and his first wife filed joint income taxes. In 1999, his first wife, without\nhis knowledge, withdrew $20,000 from her 401(k) account.  This triggered an\n1\nunexpectedly high tax debt, which they were unable to satisfy when due (Tr. 43).\nIn approximately 2000, Applicant started a church (Tr. 35). He used much of his\npersonal income to finance its start-up costs and operation. The venture was ultimately\nunsuccessful.\nIn 2001, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audited his tax returns for the\nchurch. After the audit, the IRS concluded that he owed approximately $1,600. Before\nthe audit, Applicant anticipated receiving a refund (Tr. 35). He was unable to satisfy the\ndebt on time.\nSince 2001, the IRS has been applying Applicant\u2019s yearly tax refunds to the\ndelinquency. By December 2007, he owed approximately $15,600. Through\nnegotiations, Applicant obtained a $6,000 abatement of interest and penalties, and in\nMay 2006, the IRS applied his 2007 tax refund ($3,161) to the delinquency (Exhibit T).\n\nApplicant satisfied a loan used to purchase furniture, a debt not alleged in the SOR. Also, his car loan payments\n2\nhave decreased by approximately $130 monthly.\n3\nCurrently, Applicant owes approximately $1,300 for tax year 1999 and $2,900 for tax\nyear 2001 (Exhibit T). He has applied for a loan against his 401(k) plan with the\nintention of using the loan money to satisfy the tax delinquency. As of the date of the\nhearing, the loan application had been approved (Tr. 37).\nThe remainder of the SOR delinquencies include four medical bills stemming\nfrom a 2005 rotator cuff surgery which disabled him from working for six months (SOR\nsubparagraphs 1.a through 1.d ), two utilities (SOR subparagraphs 1.e and 1.f), and a\nveterinary bill Applicant incurred when he adopted a sickly, stray cat (SOR\nsubparagraph 1.h). In January 2008, he successfully applied for a $10,000\nconsolidation loan, and used it to begin satisfying these delinquencies (Exhibit C, Tr.\n44). He has satisfied all of the delinquencies except SOR subparagraphs 1.b and 1.d,\nwhich total approximately $2,300 (Exhibits C, U). He intends to satisfy them within the\nnext six months.\nApplicant has been paying approximately $115 per month on the consolidation\nloan since January 2008 (Tr. 45). He does not anticipate any future problems paying it\nbecause his income has increased slightly in the past year while his monthly credit\npayments have recently decreased by approximately $330 monthly  (Compare Tr. 47\n2\nand Exhibit 4 at 5).\nApplicant did not list the tax lien on his February 2007 security clearance\napplication, as required. He was aware of the delinquency since its accrual, and the\ngovernment had been applying his income tax refunds to its satisfaction since 2001.\nApplicant did not know that the government had filed a lien against his property for this\ndelinquency until some time after completing the security application when the bank\nwhich approved his January 2008 consolidation loan informed him it was on his credit\nreport (Tr. 40). He answered, \u201cyes\u201d to Section 28 of the security clearance application\nregarding whether he had been more than 180 days delinquent on debt payments in the\npast seven years, and whether he was currently more than 90 days delinquent on any\ndebts (Exhibit 1 at 37).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching\n\n4\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole\nperson concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information\u201d\n(AG \u00b6 18). Here, Applicant\u2019s delinquencies, accrued between 1999 and 2006, trigger the\napplication of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nThe majority of Applicant\u2019s delinquencies constitute tax delinquencies accrued in\n1999 and 2001, and medical expenses stemming from a surgery in 2005. The 1999 tax\ndelinquency occurred when his then-wife withdrew $20,000 from her 401k plan without\nApplicant\u2019s knowledge, triggering an unexpectedly high tax bill. The 2001 tax\ndelinquency related to unanticipated tax consequences from the failure of Applicant\u2019s\nchurch. Since 2007, Applicant has negotiated a $6,000 abatement of interest and\npenalties, and obtained a loan that he intends to use to satisfy the remainder, which is\ncurrently less than $5,000. \nIn January 2008, Applicant obtained a loan that he used to begin satisfying the\nmedical delinquencies, and the other SOR delinquencies. Only two of these SOR\ndelinquencies, collectively less than $2,500, are outstanding. Applicant has been\nsteadily repaying the consolidation loan, and anticipates satisfying the two remaining\ndelinquencies within the next six months. Since he has consistently addressed his other\npast due obligations, I am confident he will address these two debts in the near future.\n\n5\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond\nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected\nmedical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation), and the individual acted\nresponsibly under the circumstances,\u201d 20(c), \u201c . . . there are clear indications that the\nproblem is being resolved or is under control,\u201d and 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-\nfaith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d apply.\nPersonal Conduct\nUnder this guideline, \u201cconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified\ninformation (AG \u00b6 15). Applicant\u2019s security clearance application omission raises the\nissue of whether AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of\nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award\nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award\nfiduciary responsibilities, \u201c applies.\nIn light of Applicant\u2019s disclosure of his other delinquencies in response to other\nsecurity clearance application questions regarding his delinquencies, I conclude his\nexplanation for omitting the tax lien from his security clearance application was credible.\nThe government has shown Applicant\u2019s answer to Section 27 of the security clearance\napplication was incorrect, but this does not prove he deliberately failed to disclose\ninformation about his tax lien. Every inaccurate statement is not a falsification. Rather, a\nfalsification must be deliberate and material. An omission of a tax lien is not deliberate if\nthe person did not know of its existence. Consequently, because Applicant did not know\nof the tax lien when he completed the security clearance application, AG \u00b6 16(a) does\nnot apply, and there are no personal conduct security concerns.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\n6\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems were caused by circumstances beyond his control.\nSince approximately January 2007, he has been resolving them. Because of the\norganized, methodical manner in which he confronted his delinquencies, and his\nimproved financial circumstances, I am confident he will satisfy the minimal remaining\ndelinquencies. Clearance is granted.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He served for two years in the National Guard, but has never held a security clearance. He is married, and has three stepchildren, ages 17, 18 and 19. He has been regularly employed as an electrician since May 1995, except for a 33 month job as a truck driver ending in 1999, and a 2 month period of unemployment in 2002. His present job started in August 2003.4 In his answer to the SOR, dated April 24, 2008, Applicant admitted the truth of the factual allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a, that he petitioned for Chapter 13 bankruptcy on July 7, 2007.

Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nApplicant submitted his electronic Questionnaire for National Security Positions\n(SF 86), on June 12, 2006. On March 24, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guidelines F.  The action was taken under Executive Order\n1\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \nSeptember 5, 2008\n\nItem 2.\n2\nThe government submitted eight items in support of the allegations.\n3\nItem 4.\n4\nItem 2 at 1.\n5\nItem 6 at 10, and Schedules B, D, E, and F.\n6\nItems 5 and 8.\n7\n2\nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 24, 2008, and requested that his\ncase be decided by an Administrative Judge on the written record without a hearing.2\nDepartment Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case on June 5, 2008. A\ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM)  was provided to Applicant, and\n3\nhe was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation,\nextenuation, or mitigation. Applicant signed the document acknowledging receipt of his\ncopy of the FORM on June 13, 2008, and returned it to DOHA. He provided no further\nresponse to the FORM within the 30-day period he was given to do so, did not request\nadditional time to respond, and made no objection to consideration of any evidence\nsubmitted by Department Counsel. I received the case assignment on August 15, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 37-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He served for two\nyears in the National Guard, but has never held a security clearance. He is married, and\nhas three stepchildren, ages 17, 18 and 19. He has been regularly employed as an\nelectrician since May 1995, except for a 33 month job as a truck driver ending in 1999,\nand a 2 month period of unemployment in 2002. His present job started in August\n2003.4\nIn his answer to the SOR, dated April 24, 2008, Applicant admitted the truth of\nthe factual allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a, that he petitioned for Chapter 13 bankruptcy on July\n7, 2007. He also stated, \u201cSince the bankruptcy was finalized, I have been paying my\ncreditors by terms of the 3 year schedule. This debt will be paid off by early 2011.\u201d  The\n5\nbankruptcy filing listed about $40,500 in assets, including $12,825 for a 2000 Ford\nFocus and $15,000 in child support owed by the father of Applicant\u2019s stepchildren. It\nalso listed $9,777 in secured debt (the car loan for the Ford), $8,249 in priority claims,\nincluding $7,896 in child support owed by Applicant and $353 in delinquent federal and\nstate income taxes for 2005 and 2006. Finally, it listed 31 unsecured creditors, and\nmany associated collection agencies, with claims totaling $31,447.   Applicant\u2019s credit\n6\nbureau reports dated August 8, 2006, and March 20, 2008, confirm his substantial\ndelinquent indebtedness, with accounts going into default as long ago as August 2000,\nand as recently as June 2007.  \n7\n\nItem 6 at 62, 63.\n8\n3\nIn his November 19, 2007 response to a written DOHA interrogatory, Applicant\nprovided bankruptcy documents including payment schedules. These schedules show\nthat Applicant made his first two scheduled bankruptcy payments in August and\nSeptember 2007. In October 2007, he paid less than half the required amount, and in\nNovember 2007 he made no payment at all.   Department Counsel highlighted this\n8\nissue in the FORM, strongly suggesting that Applicant provide an explanation for these\nnon-payments and evidence supporting his claim to be current on required bankruptcy\npayments. As noted above, Applicant failed to respond to the FORM with any additional\ninformation. Accordingly, the record evidence compels the conclusion that Applicant has\nfailed to comply with the terms of his bankruptcy since September 2007. He provided no\nother evidence of resolution or attempted resolution of any delinquent debt. He claimed\nin his answer to the SOR that he and his wife received financial counseling. However,\nthe only counseling documented in the record is the session required by bankruptcy\nlaw. Applicant provided no indication of ongoing counseling, budgeting, or change in his\nfinancial behavior, and provided no other evidence of good character, trustworthiness or\njudgment for consideration in mitigation. Since he elected a determination on the written\nrecord, no in-person evaluation of his character or credibility was possible.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\n\n4\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides: \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to an\napplicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense\nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set\nout in AG \u00b6 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 19(a), an \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated a significant number and amount of\ndelinquent debts over at least the past eight years. He was either unable or unwilling to\nrepay these debts, and provided no information that repayment of any of them is\nprobable in the foreseeable future. Applicant\u2019s only demonstrated effort to resolve his\nmore than $49,000 of debt was his July 2007 Chapter 13 bankruptcy proceeding. He\nalso defaulted on payments required under that program after only two months. The\nevidence is sufficient to raise both of these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring\na closer examination and balancing of resulting security concerns with any potentially\nmitigating matters.\nDepartment Counsel also asserted that the disqualifying conditions set forth in\nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(b) and 19(e) are supported by this record. Except to the extent that those\n\n5\ndisqualifying conditions overlap with AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), there is no record evidence\nsupporting their independent application with their focus on the reasons underlying an\napplicant\u2019s financial problems.\nThe guideline includes several conditions that could mitigate security concerns\narising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), disqualifying conditions may be\nmitigated where \u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d Applicant\u2019s financial\nissues have been a continuing problem since at least 2000. His disregard of these\nfinancial obligations is ongoing, and continues to raise concerns about his current\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. The evidence does not support this\npotentially mitigating condition. \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(b), it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Applicant has been\nregularly employed, except for a two-month period in 2002, and provided no evidence\nindicating that his debts arose due to matters beyond his control.\nEvidence that \u201cthe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control\u201d\nis potentially mitigating under AG \u00b6 20(c). This mitigating condition is potentially raised\nby Applicant\u2019s initial steps toward bankruptcy, but is not supported as a factor for\nsignificant consideration in this case due to his lack of follow through. Similarly, AG \u00b6\n20(d) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to\nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d Applicant initiated bankruptcy\nproceedings that could resolve his debts, but failed to make court-ordered payments\nafter only two months. I conclude this potentially mitigating condition has not been\nestablished.\nEven if Applicant did comply with the terms of his Chapter 13 bankruptcy, his\nsignificant indebtedness would not be resolved for several more years. His apparent\nfailure to even make the bankruptcy payments supports the inference that he remains\nfinancially overextended and, therefore, at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds. His history and pattern of financial irresponsibility further indicate a lack\nof judgment and unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, thereby raising\nsubstantial questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to safeguard\nclassified information.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\n\n6\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a mature individual who\nis responsible for his choices and conduct. He did not show that any of his debts arose\nfrom unusual medical circumstances, rather than normal care, or that the other debts\narose due to circumstances largely beyond his control. Applicant has been employed for\nall but two months of the period during which these debts became delinquent, but has\nresolved none of them. \nApplicant submitted no evidence of rehabilitation or permanent behavioral\nchange, or demonstrating that risk of coercion or duress is not significant. His ongoing\ndisregard of lawful obligations, especially after receiving notice of the security concerns\nraised thereby, creates continuing doubt about his trustworthiness and reliability. He\noffered no other evidence about his character or responsibility to mitigate these\nconcerns, or tending to make their continuation less likely. \nOverall, the record evidence creates substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nDAVID M. WHITE\nAdministrative Judge\n",

He was born and educated in India. After obtaining a bachelor of science degree in naval architecture, he worked as a software developer in India. He came to the U.S. on a business trip in April 1991 and decided to remain in the U.S, because he like the way of life in the U.S. and believed the U.S. offered better job opportunities (GX 3 at 2). He renewed his business visa twice, obtained a work visa, and eventually received a permanent resident card in 1996 (Tr. 67). He became a U.S. citizen in January 2002 and obtained a U.S. passport in May 2002 (GX 3 at 1). He has worked for his current employer since December 2005.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 8, 2007, and \nanswered it in writing on November 16, 2007. On November 21, 2007, he requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  Department Counsel filed a notice that he was \nready to proceed on November 30, 2007, and I received the case assignment on \nDecember 6, 2007. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on December 14, 2007, and I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled on January 16, 2008. The government offered \n\n \n2 \n \n \nexhibits (GX) 1 through 3, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on \nhis own behalf, called one witness, and submitted exhibits (AX) A and B, which were \nadmitted in evidence without objection.  \n \nI granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until February 8, 2008, to \nenable him to submit additional matters.  On January 23, 2008, he submitted AX C and \nD, which were admitted without objection.  His cover email for AX D stated, \u201cThis \ncompletes all documents due from me.\u201d  Department Counsel\u2019s response to AX C and \nD, dated January 24, 2008, is attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HX) IV.  \nBecause Applicant indicated he had no further documents to submit, I closed the record \non January 24, 2008, upon receipt of HX IV.  DOHA received the transcript of the \nhearing (Tr.) on January 25, 2008.  Eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of certain facts \nabout India and Iran. The request and the attached documents were not admitted in \nevidence but are attached to the record as Hearing Exhibits (HX) I and II.  The facts \nadministratively noticed are set out below. \n \nI declined to rely on three documents attached to HX I as the basis for \nadministrative notice.  First, I determined that the Congressional Research Service \nReport on India-U.S. Relations, dated June 26, 2007, was not appropriate for \nadministrative notice because it reflected the personal analysis of an individual \nspecialist but did not reflect that the views of that specialist were generally accepted or \nwere adopted by the U.S. government.  Second, I determined that the Annual Report to \nCongress on Foreign Economic Collection and Industrial Espionage for the year 2000 \nwas too old and the basis for its conclusions was too limited to be a reliable source of \ncurrent information.  See ISCR Case No. 03-21434 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2007).  \nThird, I determined that the Annual Report to Congress on Foreign Economic Collection \nand Industrial Espionage for the year 2005 was too limited to be the basis for \nadministrative notice about India, since the only reference to India in the report was one \nincident in 2004 where a U.S. software manufacturer reported that a source code and \nconfidential design documents were stolen from a research and development center in \nIndia.  I offered Department Counsel the opportunity to offer these three documents as \ngovernment exhibits, akin to learned treatises under Fed. R. Evid. 803(18), to be given \nwhatever weight I determined appropriate in my decision, and he accepted that offer.  \nThe enclosures to HX I were marked as GX 4, 5, and 6 and admitted without objection \n(Tr. 51-52).   \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nAuthentication of a Report of Investigation \n \n \nDepartment Counsel presented GX 3, a narrative summary of a security \ninvestigator\u2019s interview of Applicant under oath that was included in a Report of \nInvestigation, without calling an authenticating witness, as required by Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.20.  I explained the authentication requirement to Applicant and determined that he \nunderstood the requirement and was willing to waive it.  Based on his affirmative waiver \nof the requirement for authentication, I admitted GX 3 (Tr. 49-50). \n \nUnsigned SOR \n \n \nThe copy of the SOR in the Hearing Office file and Department Counsel\u2019s file \nwas unsigned, but Applicant\u2019s copy was signed.  I directed Department Counsel to \nobtain a signed copy of the SOR and submit it for the record (Tr. 21-23).  A copy of the \nsigned SOR is attached to the record as HX III. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations in the SOR, \nwith explanations.  His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in \nmy findings of fact.  I make the following findings. \n \n \nApplicant is a 43-year-old software engineer for a federal contractor.  He was \nborn and educated in India.  After obtaining a bachelor of science degree in naval \narchitecture, he worked as a software developer in India.  He came to the U.S. on a \nbusiness trip in April 1991 and decided to remain in the U.S, because he like the way of \nlife in the U.S. and believed the U.S. offered better job opportunities (GX 3 at 2).  He \nrenewed his business visa twice, obtained a work visa, and eventually received a \npermanent resident card in 1996 (Tr. 67).  He became a U.S. citizen in January 2002 \nand obtained a U.S. passport in May 2002 (GX 3 at 1).  He has worked for his current \nemployer since December 2005.  He obtained a master\u2019s degree in business \nadministration from a U.S. university in May 2006 (GX 1 at 10).  He received an interim \nclearance in February 2006, but it was suspended pending the outcome of his security \ninvestigation (Tr. 7, 69). \n \n \nApplicant obtained a passport from the Republic of India in 1999, before he \nbecame a U.S. citizen.  The passport was valid for ten years, expiring in November \n2009.  He presented his Indian passport to the Consulate General of the Republic of \nIndia in New York City, where it was marked \u201cCancelled.\u201d  (Answer to SOR; AX A).  He \ntestified at the hearing that he was unsure whether he was a dual citizen, but he would \nbe willing to renounce his Indian citizenship if he was (Tr. 72). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, father, and brother are citizens and residents of India.  They \nreside in the state of Goa, in the western part of India (Tr. 73).  They reside in the \n\u201cancestral house,\u201d which they own, along with Applicant\u2019s brother (Tr. 74).  Applicant \nhas telephonic contact with them about once or twice a month (Tr. 79).  Between 1991 \n\n \n4 \n \n \nand 2001, he sent money to his parents as gifts on four or five occasions, in amounts \nbetween $500 and $1,000.  He sent the money via bank transfers to an Indian bank \naccount in his name and his mother\u2019s.  He has not sent his family any money since \n2001.  After the bank inquired why there had been no activity since 2001, he closed the \naccount on January 23, 2008 (Tr. 59; AX C at 62).  There was less than $5,000 in the \naccount when he closed it (GX 2 at 4). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother is a retired teacher who worked in a private, church-related \nschool (Tr. 75).  She has been retired for about ten years (Tr. 76). Her pension is paid \nby the school, not the government (Tr. 76). She visited Applicant for about 20 days in \n2007 (Tr. 86-87).  His mother lives on her retirement pension and financial support from \nhis brother, and she no longer needs financial support from Applicant (Tr. 60).   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s father is a self-employed insurance agent.  He previously owned an \noffice services business, a restaurant, and a ship repair yard (Tr. 77).   \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s brother is a human resources manager for a U.S.-owned company in \nIndia (Tr. 61).  A second brother died in a swimming accident in April 2006 (GX 3 at 3).  \n \n \nNone of Applicant\u2019s family members have been employed by the Indian \ngovernment, military organizations, or government contractors (GX 3 at 3).  None of his \nfamily members have been arrested or detailed by Indian authorities (Tr. 85-86). \n \n \nApplicant traveled to India in 1997 for his brother\u2019s wedding, in 2001 and 2004 to \nvisit his family, and in 2006 for his brother\u2019s funeral (Tr. 80).  He used only his U.S. \npassport after becoming a U.S. citizen.  He reported his last two trips to his employer \nand received a security briefing before both trips (AX D at 3-4). \n \n \nNow that the bank account is closed, Applicant owns no assets or property in \nIndia.  He owns a condominium in the U.S. and has about $100,000 in retirement funds \nand $270,000 in investments in the U.S. (Tr. 88). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s facility security officer, who holds a clearance and retired from the \nU.S. Army after 24 years of service, testified that Applicant is \u201ca great guy,\u201d who is \ndedicated, hard-working, knowledgeable, and helpful.  He testified he would give \nApplicant a clearance if he had the authority (Tr. 97). \n \n \nGovernment documents presented by Department Counsel reflect concern in the \nU.S. Congress about India\u2019s increasing cooperation with Iran and transfers of \nequipment and technology related to weapons of mass destruction to Iran by Indian \ncompanies (GX 4).  The documents also reflect that in the year 2000 India was as a \nmajor practitioner of industrial espionage (GX 5). \n \nI have taken administrative notice of the facts below.  India\u2019s Constitution \ndescribes it as a \u201csovereign, socialist, secular democratic republic.\u201d  It is a multiparty, \nfederal, parliamentary democracy. The U.S. and India are the world\u2019s largest \n\n \n5 \n \n \ndemocracies.  The U.S. is India\u2019s largest trading partner and largest investment partner.  \nIn the past, U.S. policy toward India was dominated by concerns over India\u2019s nuclear \nweapons programs and slow pace of economic reforms.  More recently, the U.S. has \nregarded India as a growing world power with which it shares common strategic \ninterests.  Since 2004, bilateral cooperation between the U.S. and India has significantly \nincreased in civil nuclear, civil space, and high-technology commerce.   \n \nThe government of India generally respects the rights of its citizens, but it has \nexperienced major problems with extrajudicial killings of persons in custody, harsh \nprison conditions, lengthy pretrial detention without trial, disappearances, and torture \nand rape by police and security forces.  Physical abuse and excessive force have been \nused to combat terrorism and suppress violent insurgencies operating primarily in the \nnortheast part of the country.  Human rights violations often go unpunished because of \nlack of accountability and endemic corruption in the government and police forces. A \nnumber of anti-Western terrorist groups are active in India.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d  Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has \u201cthe authority to . \n. . control access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether \nan individual is sufficiently trustworthy to occupy a position . . . that will give that person \naccess to such information.\u201d  Id. at 527.  The President has authorized the Secretary of \nDefense or his designee to grant applicants eligibility for access to classified information \n\u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. \nOr. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as \namended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG).  These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information.  This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n\n \n6 \n \n \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant which disqualify, or may disqualify, the \napplicant from being eligible for access to classified information.  The government has \nthe burden of establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.  See Egan, 484 U.S. \nat 531.  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  \nSee v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The \nguidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any \nof the criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability.  See ISCR Case No. \n95-0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002).  \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d  Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s mother, father, and brother are citizens and \nresidents of India (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and that he and his mother are co-owners of a joint bank \naccount in India (SOR \u00b6 1.b).  The concern under this guideline is as follows: \u201cForeign \ncontacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual has divided loyalties or \nforeign financial interests, may be manipulated or induced to help a foreign person, \ngroup, organization, or government in a way that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable \nto pressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can \nand should consider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such considerations as whether \nthe foreign country is known to target United States citizens to obtain protected \ninformation and/or is associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d  AG \u00b6 6. \n \n \nTwo disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant to this case.  First, \na disqualifying condition may be raised by \u201ccontact with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident \nin a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(a).  Second, a disqualifying \ncondition may be raised by \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or \ncountry that create a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \n\n \n7 \n \n \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign \nperson, group, or country by providing that information.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(b).  Applicant\u2019s \ncontacts with and connections to his immediate family members in India are sufficient to \nraise these two disqualifying conditions. \n \n \nA security concern also may be raised by \u201ca substantial business, financial, or \nproperty interest in a foreign country, or in any foreign-owned or foreign-operated \nbusiness, which could subject the individual to heightened risk of foreign influence or \nexploitation.\u201d  AG \u00b6 7(e).  Applicant\u2019s joint bank account was dormant for about six \nyears and has been closed.  I conclude Applicant has refuted this allegation, and I \nresolve it in his favor. \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \ncondition in AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence to \nrebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  Applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to \nthe government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline can be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe \nnature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons are \nlocated, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it is \nunlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of \nthe U.S.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(a).  The totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well \nas each individual family tie must be considered.  ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. \nBd. Sep. 22, 2003).  \n \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \n \n \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United \nStates over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. \nFinally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields.  See ISCR Case No. \n00-0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the \nnature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights \nrecord are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known \nto conduct intelligence operations against the U.S. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s family members are not connected to or dependent on the \ngovernment of India.  They are economically self-sufficient.  None of them are involved \nin high-technology businesses susceptible to economic espionage.  Their modest social \nand economic standing, lack of political involvement, and geographical separation from \ninsurgent movements make them unlikely targets of terrorism.  \n \n \nIndia is a friendly country, a democracy, and a strategic and economic partner.  \nWhile it has experienced human rights abuses, many of those abuses were due to an \nantiquated and inefficient legal system, a government campaign against terrorism and \nviolent insurgencies, and an undisciplined and unsupervised law enforcement system.  \nAlthough India has been identified as a practitioner of economic espionage, there is no \nevidence that it uses torture or abuse of its citizens to extract economic information.  \nThe U.S. and India have had serious disagreements in the past, and India\u2019s \nrelationships with Iran have raised some concerns, but the relationship between the \nU.S. and India has evolved into a close economic, technological, and strategic \npartnership. Given its vibrant and close relationship with the U.S., it is unlikely India \nwould risk damaging that relationship by abusing its own citizens to coerce a U.S. \ncitizen to betray his country.  I conclude AG \u00b6 8(a) is established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is \nno conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the \nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d  AG \u00b6 8(b).   \n \n \nApplicant decided to stay in the U.S. and become a citizen because he was \nattracted to the way of life in the U.S.  His future and his livelihood are in the U.S.  When \nhe learned his foreign passport was a concern, he cancelled it.  When asked if he was \nwilling to renounce his Indian citizenship, he answered \u201cyes\u201d without hesitation.  He \nappears to have no political or cultural ties to India.  He was sincere, open, and credible \nat the hearing.  On the other hand, he is close to his family members, especially his \nmother.  He is unmarried and has no family members in the U.S.  I find the evidence \nregarding this mitigating condition inconclusive.  Accordingly, I conclude Applicant has \nnot carried his burden of establishing AG \u00b6 8(b).  However, as noted in the preceding \nparagraph, I am satisfied that it is unlikely that a conflict of interest will arise. \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant received an Indian passport in November 1999 \nand indicated a preference to keep it (SOR \u00b6 2.a).  The concern under this guideline is \nas follows: \u201cWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide \ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d  \nAG \u00b6 9.  A disqualifying condition may arise from \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or \nobligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen,\u201d including but not limited \nto \u201cpossession of a current foreign passport.\u201d  AG \u00b6 10(a)(1).   \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \n \nDual citizenship standing alone is not sufficient to warrant an adverse security \nclearance decision.  ISCR Case No. 99-0454 at 5, 2000 WL 1805219 (App. Bd. Oct. 17, \n2000).  Under Guideline C, \u201cthe issue is not whether an applicant is a dual national, but \nrather whether an applicant shows a preference for a foreign country through actions.\u201d  \nISCR Case No. 98-0252 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep 15, 1999). \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cdual \ncitizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country.\u201d  AG \u00b6 \n11(a).  This mitigating condition is established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by if \u201cthe individual \nhas expressed a willingness to renounce dual citizenship.\u201d  AG \u00b6 11(b).  Applicant \nstated, without hesitation or qualification, that he was willing to renounce his Indian \ncitizenship.  This mitigating condition is established. \n \n \nFinally, security concerns may be mitigated if \u201cthe passport has been destroyed, \nsurrendered to the cognizant security authority, or otherwise invalidated.\u201d  AG \u00b6 11(e).  \nThis mitigating condition is established. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.  Some of these factors were addressed \nabove under Guidelines B and C, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature, well-educated, and very intelligent adult.  He was sincere \nand candid at the hearing.  He has a reputation as a dedicated and helpful person.  His \nfacility security officer, a veteran of military service, was very impressed by Applicant \nand testified he would grant a clearance if he had the authority.  Applicant\u2019s lack of \npolitical or cultural attachment to India was obvious at the hearing.  His family lives in a \npart of India geographically distant from the ongoing violent insurgencies.  \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines B and \nC, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \n\n \n10 \n \n \nApplicant has mitigated the concerns based on foreign influence and foreign preference.  \nAccordingly, I conclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to continue his eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nMy formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by the \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.25, are set out below. \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B (Foreign Influence):  \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline C (Foreign Preference); \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nLeRoy F.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on November 8, 2007. She\nanswered the SOR in writing on November 26, 2007, and requested a hearing.\nDepartment Counsel was prepared to proceed on December 17, 2007. On December\n27, 2007, the case was assigned to me to conduct a hearing on Applicant\u2019s security\nsuitability. On January 8, 2008, I scheduled a hearing for February 14, 2008.\nMarch 28, 2008\n\n2\nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Three government exhibits (Ex. 1-3) and\nseven Applicant exhibits (Ex. A-G) were received into evidence without any objections,\nand Applicant testified, as reflected in a hearing transcript (Tr.) received by DOHA on\nFebruary 27, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and\ntestimony, eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline F, financial considerations, that Applicant failed to\nmake her mortgage payments and the lender bank filed for foreclosure in the amount of\n$85,006 in February 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), and that she owes several other debts charged\noff and/placed for collection: $96 for cable television services (SOR \u00b6 1.b), $456 for\nmedical (veterinary) services (SOR \u00b6 1.c), $921 for utility services (SOR \u00b6 1.d), $437 for\nveterinary services (SOR \u00b6 1.e), $3,860 for telephone services (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j,\n1.k), $1,818 for jewelry (SOR \u00b6 1.g), $5,827 in department store charges (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l,\n1.m, 1.n), and charged off balances of $1,319 (SOR \u00b6 1.o) and $3,835 (SOR \u00b6 1.p) to\nthe same lender. Applicant admitted the debts with the exception of a $3,593 retail store\ndebt (SOR \u00b6 1.n) that was a former boyfriend\u2019s account on which she had been added.\nShe also raised extenuating circumstances, primarily a late diagnosed mental illness of\nher husband that led him to miss work and then eventually quit working. Applicant\nexpressed her intent to file for bankruptcy in early 2008 and to press her spouse\u2019s claim\nfor social security disability. After consideration of the evidence of record, I make the\nfollowing findings of fact.\nApplicant is a 42-year-old administrative assistant. She began working for a\ndefense contractor in September 2003, and was issued an interim secret clearance in\n2004. Before her background investigation was completed, Applicant was transferred to\nanother employer due to a tasking change in December 2006. In about April 2007, that\ncompany sold her section to her current employer. Applicant does not require a security\nclearance for her administrative assistant duties, but she has been cross training for\nauditing duties that require a clearance. (Ex. 1, Tr. 50-51)\nApplicant was married to her first husband from April 1984 to June 1986. They\nhad a daughter in July 1985. Applicant had another daughter in June 1989 and a son in\nAugust 1990 in another relationship. She raised the three children on her own until\nFebruary 2003, when she married her current spouse. (Ex. 1, Tr. 47) Applicant did not\nreceive child support with the exception of two months of payments from her first\nhusband for their daughter in about 2003. (Tr. 48-49)\nApplicant was consistently employed as a bookkeeper from about April 1999 to\nApril 2001. From May 2001 to June 2003, she was employed as a customer service\nrepresentative for a printing company. She collected unemployment for three months\nthereafter until she accepted her administrative assistant position with a defense\ncontractor in September 2003. (Ex. 1)\n\nApplicant testified that her monthly mortgage payment had been about $386 monthly. (Tr. 56) Her credit\n1\nreport of March 2007 shows she had two mortgage loans before she refinanced, of $7,490 at $34 monthly for\n240 months, and of $46,800 at $380 monthly for 361 months. (Ex. 3) Her total mortgage was about $414 per\nmonth.\n3\nApplicant\u2019s spouse has had a history of working on and off due to problems with\nanxiety and impulse control that led him to not report for work or to abruptly quit. Before\ntheir marriage, he drove a fruit and vegetable delivery truck full-time in a neighboring\nstate (Tr. 53-55). After he relocated to be with Applicant, he worked as an oil technician\nfull-time at $8.00 an hour (Tr. 64) and then as a customer service representative. He did\nnot work at all in 2004. From January 2005 to August 2005, he was employed full-time\nat $10 an hour delivering furniture and appliances. (Ex. C)\nApplicant\u2019s spouse began seeing his family physician, a doctor of osteopathy, for\ncomplaints of mood swings in July 2005. He was placed on Lexapro and then Zoloft for\ndepression. He did well initially, but began taking his medications intermittently, and he\nabruptly quit his job in August 2005. During a February 2006 office visit, he complained\nof irritability and being unable to keep a job. He had missed two medical appointments\nand was counseled about that. (Ex. D) From March 25, 2006 to June 15, 2006, he\nworked full-time as a tire technician at $8.00 an hour. (Ex. C)\nIn September 2006, he worked for less than a month (Tr. 66) as a yard worker,\nplacing lumber planks on trailers, receiving shipments of wood and steel, and cleaning\nup the yard. He was paid $10 an hour. During the latter quarter of 2006, he worked full-\ntime for a rent-a-center at about $12.65 an hour. From December 20, 2006 to January\n25, 2007, Applicant ran an injection molding press part-time (20 hours weekly on\naverage) at $9.00 an hour. (Ex. C)\nFollowing a blowup at work in February 2007, Applicant\u2019s spouse complained of\nincreased stress and depression to his physician. He was counseled and placed on\nmood stabilizer medications. (Ex. D)  In April 2007, he got a job as a warehouse worker\nin receiving at a discount retailer where he was paid $8.00 an hour. (Ex. C) Despite his\nmood stabilizing medications, he continued to isolate himself, on occasion spending\ndays shut up in a dark room. By mid-May 2007, he was again unemployed and began\npursuing a disability claim for his depression and anxiety. (Ex. C, Ex. D)\nApplicant struggled financially, even before her husband\u2019s intermittent\nemployment, but her difficulties mounted when she could not count on him contributing\nto the household finances. In February 2003, she refinanced her mortgage, taking out a\n30-year conventional real estate loan of $81,175 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). Her monthly mortgage\npayment increased from about $414 monthly to $638,  but with the loan monies she\n1\nmanaged to pay off some of her other debts (Tr. 57). In June 2003, Applicant paid a\ndelinquent $495 cellular debt after charge off. In January 2004, a cable television\nprovider placed a $96 debt balance for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Applicant made\npayments toward a $2,567 debt for their wedding rings, but a balance of $1,632 was\ncharged off in 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.g). In March 2004, Applicant\u2019s three accounts with a\n\nApplicant disputes any legal responsibility for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.n, asserting it is a former boyfriend\u2019s debt\n2\n(Tr. 80-81). Her credit report of March 20, 2007 (Ex. 3) shows that it was a revolving charge account in her\nname only. She was listed as an authorized user on a different revolving charge with the same retailer. There\nis no delinquency listed under that account number.\nApplicant testified that her husband incurred a lot of the charges (\u201cMaking phone calls to people and just\n3\ntalking for a long time, like he\u2019d call his father [state omitted] and talk and talk and talk when he was having\nepisodes or he\u2019d call me at work.\u201d Tr. 77).\n4\nnationwide retailer were placed for collection in the amounts of $1,425 (SOR \u00b6 1.l), $799\n(SOR \u00b6 1.m), and $2,951 (SOR \u00b6 1.n).  In September 2004, the town filed a real estate\n2\ntax lien of $203 against Applicant. She paid it in December 2004, but that month a\ncellular telephone services provider placed a debt balance of $890 for collection (SOR \u00b6\n1.f). (Ex. 3, Tr. 74-79)\nIn May 2005, a local veterinarian referred an unpaid debt of $437 for collection\n(SOR \u00b6 1.e). (Ex. 2) That August, the town filed a $414 tax lien against her for unpaid\nproperty taxes. She satisfied the lien in December 2005. Applicant also fell behind in\ntwo auto loans that had been opened in November 2004, one for $6,218 (SOR \u00b6 1.o)\nand the other for $11,590 (SOR \u00b6 1.p). In an effort to keep her home Applicant\nvoluntarily surrendered both cars in about October 2005 so that she would no longer\nhave to make her car payments (Ex. 1, Tr. 42, 72). Respective balances of $1,319\n(SOR \u00b6 1.o) and $3,810 (SOR \u00b6 1.p) were charged off. (Ex. 3)\nIn about November 2005, Applicant was 120 days or more past due in her\nmortgage and it was transferred to a new lender. She was put on a waiting list for low-\nincome legal help (Tr. 41), and even cashed out her 401(k) at work and used the $900-\n$1,000 to make a mortgage payment. (Tr. 98) After months of struggling to catch up in\nher mortgage, Applicant stopped paying it in March 2006. (Tr. 59) There were forced to\nleave her home in November 2006, and the bank filed for foreclosure in February 2007\nin the amount of $85,006 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). The mortgage was $10,079 past due. (Ex. 3)\nIn about April 2006, Applicant incurred about $456 in veterinary charges for her\nhorse (Tr. 75) that she did not pay. In October 2006, the debt was referred for collection\n(SOR \u00b6 1.c). She was also behind $336 on a telephone bill, and a $754 debt balance\nwas in collection as of April 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.k). In September 2006, yet another tax lien\nwas filed against Applicant in the amount of $199. She paid it in November 2006, but\nalso that month, a cellular phone account held since March 2004 was charged off in the\namount of $1,427 and then placed for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.j).  In December 2006, a\n3\n$685 wireless telephone debt delinquent since December 2003 was placed for\ncollection (SOR \u00b6 1.h). (Ex. 2, Ex. 3) In March 2007, her local power company (Tr. 76)\nplaced a $921 debt balance for collection (SOR \u00b6 1.d). That September, she closed a\ntelephone services account opened in January 2007. It was $103 past due (SOR \u00b6 1.i).\n(Ex. 2, Tr. 74-79)\nOn March 5, 2007, Applicant applied for a security clearance. On her Electronic\nQuestionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP), she reported her voluntary\n\n5\nsurrender of two vehicles in 2005 \u201cdue to an illness that kept [her] husband out of work\nfor over 3 months,\u201d and the tax lien filed against her in 2005. In response to any\nfinancial delinquencies over 180 days in the last seven years and any debts currently\ndelinquent over 90 days, Applicant disclosed that she was late in her mortgage\npayments, and that she had \u201cseveral past due balances on [her] credit report at this time\n. . . due to [her] husband being ill and out of work for at least a 3-month period last year\nwithout any income.\u201d Applicant added that she was \u201cin the process of getting things\norganized and back on track.\u201d She hoped to have her mortgage situation rectified by the\nend of the month. (Ex. 1)\nIn about May 2007, Applicant gave her spouse an ultimatum to obtain treatment\nfor his problem or he would have to leave (\u201cI lost my house and I had lost enough.\u201d Tr.\n106). After he suffered an anxiety attack, he admitted himself for inpatient treatment in a\nhospital psychiatric unit from May 21, 2007 to June 5, 2007, for a mood disorder, not\notherwise specified. He was discharged on antidepressant and anti-anxiety medications\nto an intensive outpatient program. (Ex. B) His application for social security disability\nbenefits was twice denied. As of February 2008, he was continuing to appeal the denial.\n(Ex. A, Tr. 68) Other than one week of work at an animal shelter in October 2007,\nApplicant\u2019s spouse has been unemployed since about May 2007. (Tr. 101-02) His\npsychiatrist has advised him to refrain from working until his medication issues are\nsettled. (Tr. 102)  \nChecks of Applicant\u2019s credit in March 2007 and October 2007 revealed that her\nmortgage was in foreclosure and that she had made no progress toward resolving her\ndelinquent debts. As of October 2007, Equifax Information Services reported her jewelry\ndebt (SOR \u00b6 1.g) had increased to $1,818. The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h ($685), 1.i ($103),\n1.j ($1,427), 1.k ($754), 1.l ($1,435), 1.m ($799), and 1.n ($3,593) were in active\ncollection status. The deficiency balances of the two repossessed automobiles were\nlisted at $1,319 (SOR \u00b6 1.o) and $3,810 (SOR \u00b6 1.p). Applicant was also $572 past due\nin her repayment of a $9,055 student loan that she cosigned on for her daughter (Tr. 95,\n103-04). Her mortgage was listed in foreclosure with a zero balance (SOR \u00b6 1.a). (Ex.\n2) In June or July 2007, Applicant was notified of a $37,000 balance on the loan after\nthe foreclosure. (Tr. 60-61) A credit card account that she had opened in June 2006\nwith a $300 credit limit had a $515 balance but it was not past due. (Ex. 2)\nIn December 2007 or January 2008, the jewelry store lender pursued collection\nin court of the $1,818 debt balance (SOR \u00b6 1.g).  The lender is willing to wait six months\nto give Applicant some time to stabilize her financial situation. (Tr. 81) The credit union\nalso brought suit in late 2007 to recover the deficiency balances of the automobile loans\n(SOR \u00b6 1.o and 1.p), but then wrote off the debts when it became clear she could not\npay them. (Tr. 81). Her credit card with the $300 limit was delinquent as of February\n2008. (Tr. 95)\nApplicant was supporting the family on take home pay of about $853 every two\nweeks as of November 2007 plus public assistance (food stamps). (Ex. E, Ex. F)\nEffective January 1, 2008, she had taken in a tenant, who has agreed to be responsible\n\n6\nfor half of some monthly living costs (rent, utilities, telephone, cable, internet, groceries).\n(Ex. G, Tr. 42, 89-90) Applicant has a household budget that leaves her with about $300\nper month, provided her tenant pays his share. As of February 14, 2008, he had\ncontributed to the power bill and groceries but had not yet paid rent. (Tr. 90, 94)\nApplicant intends to contact her creditors, starting with those owed the smaller\namounts. (Tr. 96) She is considering bankruptcy to eliminate the debt burden of the\nmortgage but is still waiting to be assigned a lawyer under a state program. (Tr. 88) She\nhad consulted with a consumer debt counseling organization but was told she would\nhave to pursue another avenue because her debt was from other than consumer credit\ncards. (Tr. 83) In late 2007, she disputed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.n in writing with the\ncreditor but has yet to receive a reply. (Tr. 43) Her younger daughter is finishing high\nschool by taking night classes and she lives at home. (Tr. 48, 104) Her son, who is only\n17, moved to another state in late December 2007 and is supporting himself, although\nhe is still covered on her car insurance policy. (Tr. 48-49, 102-03) She has not collected\nfood stamps since he moved out as she is no longer eligible. (Tr. 85) Applicant has\nabout $25 in savings and $125 in her checking account. (Tr. 98)\n \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\n\n7\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nAs a single parent supporting three children without any help, Applicant still\nmanaged to get by financially until her marriage in February 2003. In 2004, a $96 cable\ntelevision debt was referred for collection and she was delinquent in paying for their\nwedding rings. A nationwide retailer from whom she had bought appliances referred\nabout $5,175 in delinquent debt for collection. While she disputes one of the debts, all\nthree are listed on her credit report and she has not disproved her legal responsibility for\nany of the debts. In 2005, she did not pay the veterinary charges for care of a horse that\nshe owned at the time, and she surrendered two cars to free up funds for her mortgage.\nShe even withdrew her pension funds to make a mortgage payment but eventually lost\nher home to foreclosure. Delinquent utility and telephone charges totaling $3,890 have\nbeen placed for collection since 2005. Although one lender has apparently elected to\nwrite off the deficiency balances on her two automobile loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o and 1.p), she\nis being held liable for about $37,000 of her mortgage loan balance after the foreclosure\nand over $13,000 in additional delinquent debt covered in the SOR. Significant security\n\n8\nconcerns are raised by \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(a)) and by \u201ca\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations\u201d (AG \u00b6 19(c)).\nApplicant had to support her family of five solely on her income for substantial\nperiods of time. Documents filed for social security disability for her husband show that\nhe has not held a job for longer than three months since he began treatment for mood\nswings in July 2005. The available records and testimony reflect he did not work in 2004\nand he has been unemployed since May 2007 with the exception of a one-week stint at\nan animal shelter in October. As of late 2007, Applicant\u2019s take-home pay was $853.65\nevery two weeks or about $22,195 annually, assuming 26 pay periods. Even when\nApplicant\u2019s spouse worked full-time from January 2005 to August 2005, their joint take-\nhome income was less than $40,000 annually. Whether or not Applicant could have\ndone more to make sure that her spouse took all his medications and made all his\nappointments, his inability or unwillingness to report to work was due to anxiety and\ndepression symptoms over which Applicant had little control. AG \u00b6 20(b) (\u201cthe conditions\nthat resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss\nof employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death,\ndivorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d) is\nimplicated, but it does not mitigate the security concerns raised by her substantial debt.\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debt amounts to more than twice her annual salary. At her\nhearing in mid-February 2008, Applicant expressed a credible desire to resolve her\nindebtedness, but she has yet to make any payments on her debt. She has taken a\ntenant into their apartment to pay half of some of the household expenses (rent, utilities,\ngroceries, internet, cable television) starting January 1, 2008, but the tenant had yet to\nmake his first rent payment (Tr. 90). Her husband recently received his second denial of\nsocial security benefits. His attorney\u2019s expectation of eventual success (Ex. A) is not a\nguarantee that the denial will be overturned. Even if the disability claim is resolved in\nher spouse\u2019s favor, it would take some time for Applicant to get out from under the\nburden of her substantial debt. Furthermore, Applicant\u2019s failure to remain current in her\npayments on a low-limit credit card raises doubt about whether she can be counted on\nto avoid incurring new delinquencies. As of September 2007, her debt balance of $515\nexceeded the $300 limit on the card (Ex. 2). She was not paying anything on the\naccount as of February 2008 while interest on the delinquent debt was continuing to\naccrue (\u201cThey\u2019ve sent me just statements showing the addition to interest and saying its\ndelinquent.\u201d Tr. 95). She also exercised poor financial judgment in continuing to open\nnew cellular phone accounts when others went unpaid. This financial irresponsibility is\nnot mitigated by any of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n\nAlthough the creditor has decided to not pursue collection, the evidence shows Applicant had a history of late\n4\npayments on both SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.o and 1.p. (Ex. 3).\n9\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is credited for being\ncandid about her financial problems which unfortunately are substantial and ongoing.\nShe may well be in a better position financially a year from now, especially if her spouse\nis successful in his appeal of the denial of disability benefits, but I am unable to\nconclude at this time that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her\naccess. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1. Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.o:\nAgainst Applicant4\n\n10\nSubparagraph 1.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

On February 25, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns \nunder Guideline F for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 4, 2008, which was \nreceived at DOHA on March 21, 2008. He answered the SOR in writing on April 2, \n2008, and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. DOHA received the \nresponse/request on April 4, 2008.

GE 5, GE2, GE 3. \n \nThe background investigation revealed that Applicant had filed for Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy in January 1993, and was awarded a discharge in November 1993. (SOR \u00b6 \n1.a.) GE 6. In February 1999, he filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which was dismissed \nin April 2002. The Summary of Schedules for that bankruptcy listed total assets of \n$279,038, and total liabilities of $307,633. (SOR \u00b6 1.b.) GE 7, GE 8.  \n \nDuring his July 2002 DSS interview, and referring to his 1993 Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy, he stated his financial problems began because he was taking care of his \nmother, who was uninsured and on dialysis. He added that his wife was in between jobs \nand had given birth to their youngest child. He consulted a bankruptcy attorney who \nadvised him to file for Chapter 7. GE 3. \n \nDuring the same July 2002 DSS interview, he stated he filed for Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy because his wife \u201cwas let go from her job.\u201d He stopped making payments to \nthe Trustee in February 2002 because his bankruptcy attorney advised him that he \n\u201cwould never be caught up on [his] bills.\u201d He added, \u201c[m]y intentions are to clean up all \nmy credit, even if I have to lose my house and rent a smaller home.\u201d At that time, he \n\n \n3 \n \n \nplanned to meet with his attorney in August 2002 and re-file under Chapter 13 or \nChapter 7, depending on what he could afford. GE 3. \n \nIn November 2002, he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and was awarded a \ndischarge in February 2003. (SOR \u00b6 1.c.) GE 9. \n \nSince his February 2003 Chapter 7 discharge, he has accumulated six debts \ntotaling approximately $27,337. These debts are identified in the SOR and \nsubstantiated by his September 2007 credit report and admissions to the SOR. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.d. \u2013 1.i.) GE 5, Response to SOR. These debts include one medical bill, one utility bill, \ntwo credit cards debts, and two automobile loans in arrears.  \n \nIn his November 2007 Response to Interrogatories, he explained he was \u201cin the \nprocess of making payments\u201d to the medical bill, that the utility bill \u201cwill be paid off in two \nweeks,\u201d that he \u201cwill set up a payment plan\u201d for the two credit card debts, that he \u201c[has] \nagreed [to] give back car\u201d for one of the automobiles, and \u201cwill talk to dealer about \ngiving back car\u201d for the other automobile. He further explained \u201cmy credit is not good but \nI am trying to clear it up and bring my credit scores up. I am delinquent on some debts \nhowever financiall[y] we are getting better.\u201d The Personal Financial Statement attached \nto the Response to Interrogatories showed a negative cash flow of over $1,000. (SOR \u00b6 \n1.j.) GE 2.  \n \nAt the time of his hearing, Applicant did not provide any evidence demonstrating \nthat he had followed through on any of his stated intentions contained in his November \n2007 Response to Interrogatories. As of the hearing date, the government also \nsubmitted an April 2008 credit report reflecting that Applicant\u2019s financial situation had \nnot improved. GE 4. At his hearing, Applicant restated his previous intentions to pay off \nor pay down his bills. Tr. 22-29. None of the six debts that were incurred after \nApplicant\u2019s Chapter 7 discharge in 2002 have been resolved. Tr. 29-33. \n \nApplicant explained: \n \n[T]he first bankruptcy was a matter of bad judgment. . . . The second \n(bankruptcy) was when my second child was born, my wife stayed home \nwith the child and I took over all the bills. She was out of work for about a \nyear and a half. . . . Moving up to the present time, we worked together as \na team. She runs a catering business. What she does is school lunches \nand I\u2019m an illustrator at [defense contractor site]. She became sick \napproximately a year and a half ago. She came down with something \ncalled Crohn\u2019s disease. She lost several of her contracts because she was \nincapacitated. We went to [hospital] and she was operated on and that \noperation saved her life. She\u2019s still in a kind of a sensitive state, but she\u2019s \nrecovered to the fact that she\u2019s back working. And in order for both of us \nto make it, she has to work, too. And now we are beginning to see some \nlight. I understand that there is a lot of sacrifices that I have to make to \nbring myself back into a financial stability and there\u2019s a couple of things I \n\n \n4 \n \n \nplan to do to do that. . . . Well, first of all, with the owner of the house that I \nlive in, we\u2019re going to begin to downsize. We\u2019re renting with the option of \nbuying. I took out the option to buy. Our lease runs out in July. I decided \nnot to redo the lease. We\u2019re going to downsize to an apartment perhaps or \nsomething that\u2019s within our price range. Tr. 14-15. \n \nApplicant also submitted a \u201cPlan for [F]inancial [R]ecovery.\u201d The plan included \nsetting aside $400 from his tax return to pay down bills, downsizing their home, moving \nhis family out of state for six months while Applicant\u2019s lives locally with his brother, and \nenrolling in a debt recovery program That program includes a plan to meet with a \nfinancial counselor in June 2008 (month after hearing date). AE G - I. \n \nApplicant went through various degrees of financial counseling associated with \nhis three bankruptcies. Tr. 52-55, 57-58. He also received financial counseling through \nhis church (circa 2002 \u2013 2004). Tr. 58-59, 60.  \n \nApplicant submitted three reference letters that provided favorable comments \nabout his character and supported his being granted a clearance. AE A through C. He \nalso provided three certificates reflecting favorable work-related performance. AE D \u2013 F. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n  \n  \nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations),1 the Government\u2019s concern is that \nan Applicant\u2019s \u201c[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who \nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant has a history of failing to meet his financial obligations dating back to \n1993. He filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1993 and was awarded a discharge. He filed \nfor Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection in 1999, which was dismissed in 2002. He \nconverted that Chapter 13 bankruptcy to a Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2002, and was \nawarded a discharge in 2003. Since that discharge, he has accumulated at least six \ndelinquent/charged off debts totaling approximately $27,337.  \n \nIn July 2002, Applicant was interviewed by DSS regarding his financial problems \nand stated his intentions to resolve his financial difficulties. In his November 2007 \nResponse to Interrogatories, he restated those same intentions, and again at his \nhearing. He presented no evidence to show he has taken any action to resolve his \ndebts or show that he is on the road to financial recovery. His financial recovery plan is \n \n1  Guideline \u00b6 18. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n                                                          \nprospective in nature. His financial difficulties date back to at least 1993. As of the \nhearing date, he still had the same six outstanding and unmitigated delinquent/charged \noff debts identified in his November 2007 Response to Interrogatories and February \n2008 SOR. Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) \u00b6 19(a): inability \nor unwillingness to satisfy debts; and FC DC \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial \nobligations; apply in this case.  \n \n \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,2 I conclude that Applicant is able to \nreceive partial credit under Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition (FC MC \u00b6 \n20(b) discussed infra as a result of his wife\u2019s illness in 2006 and subsequent loss of \nincome. I also gave Applicant credit for receiving credit counseling under FC 20(c), \ndiscussed infra . However, whatever credit is received by those MCs is overcome by \nyears of financial mismanagement going back to at least 1993. Applicant presented no \nevidence documenting efforts taken to contact or resolve debts with the six creditors \nidentified in the SOR. Nor is there any evidence that his past participation in financial \ncounseling, especially that associated with his two Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 \nbankruptcies netted in any tangible results.  \n \nI specifically considered FC MC \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and FC MC \u00b6 20(c): the \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control. \n \nApplicant\u2019s uncorroborated testimony fails to establish mitigating factors that may \nbe considered as circumstances beyond his control contributing to his inability to pay his \ndebts. When confronted with the government\u2019s concerns that his financial past was a \nsecurity concern, he failed to pursue any corrective action that would have included \ndisputing or otherwise resolving past debts.   \n \nHe presented no evidence to show he has dealt responsibly with his financial \nobligations before, or especially after receipt of the SOR (i.e., paid debts, settlements, \ndocumented negotiations, credible payment plans). Applicant\u2019s financial history and lack \nof favorable evidence preclude a finding that he has established a track record of \nfinancial responsibility, or that he has taken control of his financial situation. Based on \nhis past performance, his prospective assurances ring hollow. His financial problems \nare likely to be a concern in the future. Moreover, his financial problems are recent, not \nisolated, and ongoing.  \n \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the financial considerations security concerns. Applicant did not meet his \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this \n \n2  See ISCR Case No. 03- 02374 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 26, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. 02-22173 \nat 4 (App. Bd. May 26, 2004)). When making a recency analysis for FC MC 1, all debts are considered as \na whole. \n\n \n7 \n \n \nconclusion, the whole person concept was given due consideration and that analysis \ndoes not support a favorable decision. \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a. \u2013 1.j.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nROBERT J. TUIDER \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On December 5, 2007, the Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F for Applicant. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nJuly 3, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on December 28. 2007, and requested \na hearing before an Administrative Judge.

That marriage ended by divorce. Applicant has no dependents. GE \n1, Tr. 82. \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation addressed his financial situation and \nincluded the review of his e-QIP, credit reports, financial interrogatories, and various \ndocuments submitted by the government. SOR. GE 1 \u2013 12. The allegations are \nsubstantiated by Applicants admissions and documents submitted by the government. \n \nApplicant\u2019s SOR identified 14 separate line items, which included a chapter 7 \nbankruptcy, six collection accounts, two charged off accounts, one Internal Revenue \n(IRS) tax debt, one state tax debt, and three judgments for a total of $23,111. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a. \u2013 1.n. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n \nApplicant provided the following explanation regarding how his financial \nproblems began: \n \n[W]hen I was about 17 I was diagnosed as terminally ill and at that point \ndue to the fact that I thought I was going to die within two, three years, I \ndidn\u2019t care about anything financially. As time went on and I realized that \nI would be alive longer, I started caring about the financial stuff but I had \nalready started getting myself into a financial black hole of sorts. The \nthing that actually pushed me to file bankruptcy . . . is the . . . County \nHospital bill for $2,600. They actually ended up taking legal action and \nlocking my entire bank account. And when they locked my bank account \nI had direct deposit at the time, they at the same time locked up a direct \ndeposit that had gone through so I couldn\u2019t pay my rent, car payment, \nanything like that. And the legal advice I got when I talked to a lawyer \nwas that the only way for me to get that money back from my paycheck \nwas to file bankruptcy before the court hearing that was to take place on \nI believe, November 1st. So, I filed the bankruptcy with a lawyer and it \nwas actually filed by October 31st (2000) so that I could actually get that \npaycheck back. (SOR \u00b6 1.a.) Tr. 29-30. \n \nApplicant explained the reason he got into financial difficulties after filing \nbankruptcy in 2000 was due to \u201ca combination of bad decision[s], [and] not making \nenough money.\u201d Tr. 84. He became aware his credit history was poor when \ninterviewed in March 2007 in conjunction with his security clearance application. Since \nthen, he has taken aggressive steps to correct his indebtedness. Tr. 82-86.  \n \nSince his SOR was issued, Applicant has paid off three debts (two collection \naccounts and one judgment) (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b., 1.i., and 1.l.), has contacted six creditors \n(four collection accounts, the IRS, and state tax debt), set up payment plans, and is \ncurrent on the payment plans. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c., 1.d., 1.f., 1.g., 1.j., and 1.k.) He made a \ngood-faith effort to resolve two debts (one collection account and one judgment). \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e., 1.n.) Response to SOR, Tr. 35-62, GE 2, AE A \u2013 Q, AE Z, AE FF. One \nof the debts listed (judgment) was discharged in his 2001 Chapter 7 bankruptcy. (SOR \n\u00b6 1.m.) Tr. 56-59, GE 10, AE B. Applicant retained the services of a credit counseling \nservice in September 2007 and several of the debts included in the payment plans \nsupra are included in a debt consolidation repayment plan. Response to SOR. \nApplicant submitted a comprehensive budget that was prepared by a credit counseling \nservice reflecting a net monthly remainder of $531 after all his debts were paid. AE \nDD, AE EE. \n \nApplicant provided three employer-related reference letters, i.e. from his Task \nSupervisor, his Provisioning Support Services Division Manager, and his Task \nSupervisor III. These individuals were uniform in their praise of Applicant and \ndescribed him as \u201can excellent worker,\u201d \u201cdependable, reliable, and trustworthy,\u201d \u201ctop \nfive in efficiency (out of 28 peers), on-time delivery and customer support,\u201d and \n\n \n4 \n \n \n\u201ctrustworthy, and independent.\u201d All three individuals recommended Applicant for a \nsecurity clearance. AE AA \u2013 CC. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In \naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative \nguidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are \nuseful in evaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based \non the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n\n \n5 \n \n \n                                                          \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n  \n  \nUnder Guideline F (Financial Considerations),1 the government\u2019s concern is \nthat an Applicant\u2019s \n \n \u201c[f]ailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.\u201d \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged he made poor financial decisions, before and after his \n2000 Chapter 7 bankruptcy. His pre-bankruptcy problems occurred at a young age \nafter being diagnosed with what he thought at the time was a terminal illness. He \nembarked on an irresponsible spending pattern, which lead to Chapter 7 bankruptcy. \nAfter being awarded a Chapter 7 discharge, his health took a turn for the better and he \nfell into a pattern of spending beyond his means. His financial situation has \nsubstantially improved as a result of earning more income, maturity, and the \nrealization that his failure to handle his finances responsibly may jeopardize his ability \nto obtain and maintain a security clearance. Since being interviewed in 2007, he has \ntaken this process quite seriously and taken what appears to be all reasonable steps \nto correct his financial situation. He is current on his payments and provided credible \ndocumentation of good faith attempts to contact two creditors yet to be paid.  \n \n \nHe participated in two separate types of financial counseling. The first financial \ncounseling he participated in was mandatory and in conjunction with his chapter 7 \nbankruptcy. The second financial counseling he participated in was voluntary and \noccurred more recently. Applicant\u2019s financial picture has taken a sharp turnaround \nfrom where he was several years ago. His budget reflects a net remainder of $531 per \nmonth after his monthly bills are paid. What is different now as opposed to before is he \nhas the means, tools and resolve to achieve financial stability. \n \n \nHis reference letters are noteworthy. He has proven to be a conscientious, \ntrusted and valued employee, and a contributing member of society. \n \n\u00b6 19. Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \ninclude: \n \n1  Guideline \u00b6 18. \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; \n \n(b) indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and the \nabsence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or \nestablish a realistic plan to pay the debt. \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \n \n(d) deceptive or illegal financial practices such as embezzlement, \nemployee theft, check fraud, income tax evasion, expense account \nfraud, filing deceptive loan statements, and other intentional financial \nbreaches of trust; \n \n(e) consistent spending beyond one's means, which may be indicated by \nexcessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high debt-to-\nincome ratio, and/or other financial analysis; \n \n(f) financial problems that are linked to drug abuse, alcoholism, gambling \nproblems, or other issues of security concern; \n \n(g) failure to file annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns as \nrequired or the fraudulent filing of the same; \n \n(h) unexplained affluence, as shown by a lifestyle or standard of living, \nincrease in net worth, or money transfers that cannot be explained by \nsubject's known legal sources of income; and \n \n(i) compulsive or addictive gambling as indicated by an unsuccessful \nattempt to stop gambling, \"chasing losses\" (i.e. increasing the bets or \nreturning another day in an effort to get even), concealment of gambling \nlosses, borrowing money to fund gambling or pay gambling debts, family \nconflict or other problems caused by gambling. \n \nOf the nine Financial Considerations Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) listed \nsupra, three are applicable: \u00b6 19(a): inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; FC DC \u00b6 \n19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations; \u00b6 (e) consistent spending beyond \none's means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative \ncash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis; \n \n\u00b6 20. Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n\n \n7 \n \n \n                                                          \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), \nand \nthe \nindividual \nacted \nresponsibly \nunder \nthe \ncircumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue; and \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income. \n \n \nConsidering the record evidence as a whole,2 I conclude three of the six \nFinancial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) are applicable or partially \napplicable: \u00b6 20(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts, and \u00b6 20(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute \nthe legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of \nactions to resolve the issue. \n \nTo conclude, Applicant presented sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. Applicant met his ultimate \nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this \nconclusion, the whole person concept was given due consideration and that analysis \ndoes support a favorable decision. \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d3 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines.

When making a recency analysis for FC MC 1, all debts are considered \nas a whole. \n \n3 See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd.

On January 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nF and E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on January 30, 2008. He answered\nthe SOR in writing on February 15, 2008, and requested a hearing before an\nJune 17, 2008\n\nGE 1 (Applicant\u2019s security clearance application, dated October 19, 2006) at 2, 7; Tr. 29, 76.\n1\nTr. 29-30.\n2\nId. at 21-23, 26-27; GE 1, supra note 1, at 4-10.\n3\nTr. 72, 79-82.\n4\n2\nadministrative judge. DOHA received the request on February 19, 2008. Department\nCounsel was prepared to proceed on February 27, 2008, and I received the case\nassignment on February 28, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 24, 2008,\nand I convened the hearing as scheduled on April 29, 2008. The government offered\nfive exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which were received and admitted into evidence without\nobjection. Applicant and one witness testified on his behalf. He submitted two exhibits\n(AE) A and B, which were received and admitted into evidence without objection. DOHA\nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on May 9, 2008. I held the record open until\nMay 16, 2008, for Applicant to submit additional matters.  He did not submitted any\nadditional evidence. The record closed on May 16, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated February 15, 2008, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.j, 2.a and part of 2.b of the SOR. He denied the\nremaining factual allegation in \u00b6 2.b of the SOR and that his financial problems were a\nsecurity concern and that he was dishonest or untrustworthy.\nApplicant, who is 50 years old, works for a Department of defense contractor as\nan engineering equipment mechanic. He began his employment with his current\nemployer on October 1, 2005. He submitted his security clearance application one year\nlater.1\nApplicant is married and has two children, ages 20 and 18. His oldest child is a\ncollege student, who works part-time. Applicant holds a bachelor degree in metallurgy.2\nIn 1987, Applicant began working in the aerospace industry. When his company\nmerged with another, the new company decided to downsize and laid him off from his\njob. For the next several years, he worked sporadically, moving twice in the summer of\n1995 and twice in the first six months of 1996. He started working for a gold mining\ncompany in 1997 in a rural area of the State. The company ceased operations and laid\noff its workforce, including Applicant, in November 2004. He returned to work in April\n2005 and has worked steadily since.3\nIn 1998, Applicant\u2019s wife sustained an on-the-job injury. She returned to work\npart-time in 2002 and worked until 2004. In August 2005, she obtained a full-time job,\npaying $10 an hour. Six months later, she sustained an on-the-job injury. Her employer\nterminated her in February 2006. She currently works full-time, earning a base salary of\n$12.78 an hour plus shift differential pay.4\n\nGE 2 (Financial interrogatories and Applicant\u2019s response with attachments) at 9-13; Tr. 24, 100-101.\n5\nGE 2, supra note 1, at 17, 19; GE 3 (Credit report, dated November 21, 2006) at 4, 6; GE 4 (Credit report,\n6\ndated September 21, 2007) at 1-2; GE 5 (Credit report, dated April 23, 2008) at 2; Tr. 41-49, 91, 110, 114-121.\nGE 2, supra note 1, at 14-16, 18; GE 3, supra note 6, at 4, 6, 8; GE 4, supra note 6, at 1; GE 5, supra note\n7\n6, at 1-2; Tr. 31-36, 39-40, 69, 83. \nTr. 40-41, 54.\n8\n3\nApplicant earns approximately $40,000 a year. He earned $68,000 a year in\n2004. His net monthly income is approximately $2,200 and his wife\u2019s net monthly\nincome is approximately $1,800 a month for a total household net monthly income of\n$4,000. Their estimated monthly living expenses, including rent, food, utilities, car\nexpenses, and other household expenses, is $4,385. Applicant does not have enough\nincome each month to pay his household expenses based on his estimate. At the\nhearing, his wife indicated they are paying their monthly expenses, but do not have any\nmoney to pay creditors.5\nApplicant and his family lived in a very rural area of the state when he worked for\nthe gold mining company. They purchased a home near his place of employment. He\nreceived no severance pay when his employer laid him off in 2004, and his wife was not\nworking at the time. He lacked funds to pay his monthly mortgage and the second\nmortgage on the house. He tried to sell the house, but, because of the rural location, he\nwas unable to sell the house. The mortgagor foreclosed on his house. As a result of the\nforeclosure, Applicant still owes approximately $17,000 on his primary mortgage, a fact\nhe realized during the hearing. He also owes more than $22,000 on his second\nmortgage. He has not paid these debts.6\nIn 2002, Applicant\u2019s son severely injured his arm. He and his wife took their son\nto the nearest walk-in emergency medical center. The emergency medical center\nreferred them to a hospital, which Applicant later determined was not a participant in\ntheir health care plan. The medical insurer and the hospital argued over payment of the\nbill. His employer\u2019s human resource office told him not to pay any bills until the matter\nwas resolved. At the time his employer terminated him, the payment issue had not been\nresolved. He acknowledges that he owes the medical bills listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through\n1.c. He made payments on some of these medical bills for a period of time, but has not\nmade any payments since September 2007 because of his wife\u2019s car accident and\ninjury in August 2007. Some of the medical bills remain outstanding.7\nApplicant\u2019s wife believed the debt listed in SOR \u00b6 1.d had been paid, but\nApplicant did not provide proof of payment. He acknowledges the debt listed in SOR \u00b6\n1.j. He has a current and timely paid account with this creditor. He has asked the\ncreditor to place the outstanding amount on his current bill and he would pay a small\npart of the bill each month. The creditor declined to do so. The bill remains unpaid.8\n\nGE 2, supra note 1, attachments; AE B (Documents from credit counseling service); Tr. 61-63, 84-88, 140.\n9\nTr. 42, 145-147.\n10\n4\nApplicant admitted owing the debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g through 1.i in his\nresponse to the SOR. He is no longer sure he owes these debts as the counseling\nservice he recently contacted cannot identify the debts. Applicant has spoken with two\nseparate credit counseling services about paying his debt. The recent counseling\nservices recommended that he consider filing bankruptcy. He has spoken to an attorney\nabout filing bankruptcy, but has not retained the services of an attorney. At the hearing,\nApplicant advised that he is considering filing for bankruptcy. He is overwhelmed by his\ndebts.9\nApplicant has a 401(k) account valued at $28,000. He has not used this money\nto pay his debts because of the penalties he would incur if he accessed the money at\nthis time. He has a piece of land in a very rural area valued at $28,000, which he might\nsell, although he does not think it would sell because of its location. His motor vehicles\nare very old, of limited value, and without debt.10\nWhen he completed his security clearance application, Applicant answered \u201cno\u201d\nto the following questions:\nSection 27: Your Financial Record b. In the last 7 years, have you had\nyour wages garnished or had any property repossessed for any reason?\nSection 28: Your Financial Delinquencies a. In the last 7 years, have you\nbeen over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)? [and] b. Are you currently\nover 90 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\nApplicant admits that he has old, unpaid debts and his house was repossessed,\nbut denies any wage garnishment. When he read wage garnishment, he answered no\nwithout reading the question further. He did not pay careful attention to the questions\nand his answers. He denies deliberately falsifying his answers.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n\n5\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\n\n6\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated significant delinquent debt subsequent to his\njob termination in 2004. He has been unable to repay his past due obligations. The\nevidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer\nexamination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial worries have been ongoing for several years and are not resolved. However,\nhis unpaid medical bills are a result of misdirection by a medical service and a dispute\nwith the medical insurance carrier. It is unlikely that he will encountered a similar\nproblem concerning his medical bills. This potentially mitigating condition has some\napplicability. \nUnder AG & 20(b), mitigation can occur when Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, some of\nthe financial problems arose because of a dispute with his medical insurer. His major\nfinancial difficulties occurred following the loss of his job in 2004 and his inability to sell\nhis house because of its rural location. In addition, his wife was not employed at the\ntime of his job termination. Because his debts remain unpaid, I find this potentially\nmitigating condition is partially applicable. \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Applicant twice contacted credit counselors in\nan effort to resolve his debts. For a period of time in 2007, he made payment to one\ncredit collector. This mitigating condition is only partially applicable because there are\nnot clear indications that his finances are under control.\nSimilarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ In this case,\nApplicant has made some effort to pay his outstanding medical bills. He, however, has\nnot made any effort to resolve his major debts, one of which he did not realize he owed\nuntil the hearing. This mitigating condition is not applicable. The remaining mitigating\nconditions in this guideline do not apply.\n\nSee ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov.17, 2004)(explaining holding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133\n11\nat 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004)).\n7\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct::\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nAG \u00b6 16(a) describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;\nThe government established that Applicant omitted material facts from his SF-86\nwhen he answered \u201cno\u201d to Question b in Section 27 and Questions a and b in Section\n28  about his financial delinquencies. This information is material to the evaluation of\nApplicant\u2019s trustworthiness to hold a security clearance and to his honesty. For this\nguideline to apply, Applicant\u2019s omission must be deliberate. He denies, however, that he\ndeliberately falsified his answer to these questions. When a falsification allegation is\ncontroverted, the government has the burden of proving it. Proof of an omission,\nstanding alone, does not establish or prove an applicant\u2019s intent or state of mind when\nthe omission occurred. An administrative judge must consider the record evidence as a\nwhole to determine whether there is direct or circumstantial evidence concerning an\napplicant\u2019s intent or state of mind at the time the omission occurred.  For DC \u00b6 16 (a) to\n11\napply, the government must establish that Applicant\u2019s omission, concealment or\nfalsification in his answer was deliberate.\nAt the time he completed his SF-86, Applicant knew he had financial problems\nfrom the past. He credibly testified that he read garnishment and answered \u201cno\u201d without\nreading the question in its entirety. Although Section 28 clearly asks for information\nabout past unpaid debts and he knew he had old, unpaid debts, Applicant\u2019s\npresentation at the hearing showed me that he had little understanding about the extent\nof his debts current or past. His wife has a much better understanding of the family\u2019s\nfinances. He did not deliberately falsify his answer to this question. The government has\nnot established its case under guideline E.\n\n8\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the surrounding circumstances. The administrative judge should\nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s initial financial problems\nbegan when he lost his job in the aerospace industry in 1994. With the income earned\nat the gold mining company, he paid his bills. The loss of this job caused serious\nfinancial problems for him, particularly since his wife was not working. He could not pay\nhis mortgage nor could he sell his house. As a result, the mortgagor foreclosed on this\nhouse. Although he has worked steadily for the last three years, his income is\nsignificantly lower than the income he earned working for the mining company. The\nhousehold income barely pays his family\u2019s monthly expenses. He has no additional\nfunds to repay his old debts. He is considering filing for bankruptcy. Applicant needs\nmore time to improve his financial situation. Although I do not believe he can be\ncoerced, pressured or exploited because of his debt problems, he has not gained\ncontrol over his finances. He is overwhelmed by his financial problems, and thus, the\npotential exists for his debt problems to reoccur or increase.  He has not mitigated the\ngovernment\u2019s security concerns. (See AG & 2(a)(1).)  \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s\neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude\nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial\nconsiderations and personal conduct. \n\n9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Fayle, Esquire\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-\nQIP) on October 30, 2006. On June 18, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline G that provided the basis for its decision to deny him\na security clearance. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense as of September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on July 10, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on July 22, 2008,\nto consider whether it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue\nDecember 18, 2008\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n2\na security clearance for him. On September 4, 2008, I scheduled a hearing for October\n1, 2008. At the request of Applicant\u2019s counsel, I granted a continuance on September\n19, 2008. By notice dated October 3, 2008, I rescheduled the hearing for November 6,\n2008.\nThe hearing was held as rescheduled. Five government exhibits (Ex. 1-5) and 13\nApplicant exhibits (Ex. A-M) were admitted without any objections. Applicant and his\nspouse testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on November 14, 2008.\nBased on review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline G, alcohol consumption, that Applicant consumed\nalcohol on a daily basis, including to intoxication at least once to twice each week, from\nabout 1997 to August 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); that he admitted himself for detoxification to a\nhospital on August 8, 2005, where he was diagnosed with alcohol dependence and\nfollowing treatment discharged on August 10, 2005 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); that on discharge he\nwas advised to continue in aftercare and he indicated he would attend Alcoholics\nAnonymous (AA) (SOR \u00b6 1.c); that after abstaining for about one year he resumed\ndrinking alcohol in 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); and that he has continued to consume alcohol\nsince 2006 despite being diagnosed as alcohol dependent (SOR \u00b6 1.e). Applicant\nadmitted the allegations but in response to SOR \u00b6 1.e, he denied that he is alcohol\ndependent. His admissions are incorporated as factual findings. After considering the\nrecord evidence, I make the following additional findings.\nApplicant is a 39-year-old operations analyst who has been employed by a\ndefense contractor since November 2005 (Ex.1, Tr. 34). He seeks a secret security\nclearance (Ex. D).\nAfter high school, Applicant worked as an automotive technician while pursuing\nhis associate\u2019s degree in that trade at a local technical college (Tr. 21-22). On receiving\nhis degree in May 1989 (Tr. 24), he continued to work at the same automotive center for\nthe next nine years (Ex. 1, Ex. M). Applicant, who had his first drink at age 18 (Ex. 2,\nEx. 3, Tr. 22), consumed alcohol in a social context, primarily on weekends (Ex. H, Tr.\n23). Coworkers with whom he consumed alcohol consider Applicant\u2019s drinking to have\nbeen social and appropriate, as he drank no more than three or four beers per occasion\n(Ex. H, Ex. I).\nIn August 1997, Applicant began working as a bar back/bartender at a downtown\nclub (tavern) while maintaining his day job as an automotive mechanic (Ex. 1, Ex. M). In\nFebruary 1998, he left the auto center and became a full-time employee of the tavern\n\nApplicant attributes his excessive drinking to his lifestyle at the time. He was working in a bar and\n1\nup all night: \nI would get up in the afternoon, that\u2019s when my friends would be getting together and, you\nknow, they had already worked all day, so they were having a couple of beers, while me,\nhanging with them, it was like morning for me but it was actually evening for them, so it just\nkind of progressively got away from me. (Tr. 61)\nApplicant listed his employment as a painter on his e-QIP (Ex. 1) but not on his resume (Ex. M).\n2\nW hen he was admitted for detoxification treatment in August 2005, he told the medical staff that he had been\nunemployed for five months (Ex. 4).\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n3\n(Ex. 1, Ex. M, Tr. 23). The work environment was conducive to drinking,  and Applicant\n1\nbegan to consume alcohol on a daily basis, and to intoxication a few times each week.\nHis drinking increased over time to 30 beers or more per day (Ex. J). He drank during\nthe day before reporting to work at 6:00 p.m. and also while on the job (Tr. 24-25). His\nroommate at the time, who has known him since they worked together at the automotive\ncenter, warned Applicant that his drinking was getting out of control (Tr. H). In about\n2003, Applicant was thinking about reducing his consumption. At the urging of his then\ngirlfriend who thought he was drinking too much, Applicant attended one AA meeting to\nsee what it involved (Tr. 135-36).\nIn spring 2004, Applicant met his spouse and they began dating shortly thereafter\n(Tr. 26, 74). He was up-front with her about his drinking when she asked him, but she\ndid not realize the magnitude of his drinking problem at that time (Tr. 80).\nApplicant was laid off from his job at the tavern in late November/early December\n2004. Applicant moved in with his spouse and her then five-year-old daughter, and they\nmarried later that month (Ex. 1, Tr. 27, 78). He worked as a painter, full-time starting in\nspring 2005 (Ex. 1, Ex. M, Tr. 28, 80).  Applicant did not drink at work, but consumed\n2\nalcohol excessively at home after work, about 20 beers on a daily basis (Tr. 29-30).\nGiven an ultimatum from his spouse that they would not stay together unless he\nregained his sobriety (Ex. J), Applicant experienced withdrawal symptoms (\u201cshakes,\u201d\nvomiting) as he unsuccessfully attempted to cut back on his drinking (Tr. 48-49, 81-82,\n92). With his spouse expressing daily concerns about his drinking and fears that he\nwould have a heart attack if he stopped drinking without medical supervision (Tr. 82-83),\nhe voluntarily sought detoxification treatment at a hospital on August 8, 2005 (Ex. 3, Tr.\n30-31). His blood alcohol level was .17%, and he was diagnosed with alcohol\ndependence. Applicant appeared motivated to achieve sobriety, but he also expressed\nthat he may be able to drink socially some day. Initial treatment plan was a five-day\nmedical detoxification with group and individual sessions. He was discharged on August\n10, 2005, with an aftercare appointment scheduled for August 16, 2005, and a plan to\nattend AA meetings (Ex. 4). He was advised to abstain from alcohol (\u201cThey just say\nabstain . . . I don\u2019t think it was specified whether it was permanent.\u201d Tr. 52). At\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n4\ndischarge, Applicant\u2019s intent was to abstain from alcohol until he felt ready to handle\nsocial drinking (Tr. 52-53).\nFollowing his discharge, Applicant did not consume any alcohol for about 11\nmonths (Ex. 3, Tr. 32, 55). He went to three or four AA meetings with a friend\u2019s father\ninvolved in the program (Tr. 125), but did not think AA was for him (Tr. 53-54, 70). He\ndid not pursue any other aftercare (Tr. 55, 131-32). On occasion, he discussed alcohol\nissues with his friend\u2019s father (Tr. 125-27, 137).  Most of these discussions took place\nshortly after his detoxification treatment (Tr. 137). Applicant has not initiated contact\nwith him recently surrounding his alcohol use because he has not felt the need to do so\n(Tr. 126).\nIn November 2005, Applicant started working for his present employer as an\ninstallation mechanic/painter (Ex. 1, Ex. M, Tr. 33-34). He testified he did not require a\nsecurity clearance for that position (Tr. 34), although he completed his e-QIP on\nOctober 30, 2006 (Ex. 1). \nApplicant drank two or three beers on July 4, 2006 (Tr. 32, 57, 99). He no longer\nconsidered himself to have an alcohol problem, and he felt he was ready to handle\nsocial drinking (Tr. 55-56). He and his spouse discussed the issue of him resuming\ndrinking beforehand, and they agreed that if either of them felt his drinking was a\nproblem, there would be no drinking (Tr. 85). He has continued to consume beer with\nhis spouse and/or friends because he enjoys it (Ex. 2). He testified he consumes usually\ntwo or three, \u201cjust every once in awhile, maybe a couple times a week on the weekends\u201d\n(Tr. 33, 59, 64, 68), although in response to DOHA interrogatories, he related in October\n2007 a frequency of \u201c0-10 12 oz. beers weekly\u201d (Ex. 2). He also drinks at home with\ndinner on occasion, to as recently as November 2008 (Tr. 105-06). In June 2008, he\ndrank four beers at a friend\u2019s bachelor party (Tr. 70). Applicant continues to socialize\nwith the friends with whom he drank excessively in the past (Tr. 61). On occasion, he\nhas gone out and purchased a six-pack of beer to bring to the neighbors or to friends\nand friends have brought beer to his residence (Tr. 102). He denies drinking to\nintoxication (i.e., losing control) since July 2006 (Tr. 58). The friend whose father took\nApplicant to AA in 2005 has offered Applicant a beer during the work week and on\nweekends. He has not seen him drink to excess (Ex. G). Applicant informed his friend\u2019s\nfather that he has resumed drinking. A recovering alcoholic (Ex. G) with more than 20\nyears of sobriety (Tr. 120), he told Applicant to be careful, although he made no specific\nrecommendation as to whether Applicant should abstain (Tr. 127-28). Applicant intends\nto continue to consume alcohol at his present rate (Ex. 3). He has never been arrested\non any alcohol-related charges (Ex. 3, Tr. 38).\nSince resuming drinking, Applicant has not consumed alcohol on the job. Nor has\nhe reported for work intoxicated or impaired from alcohol (Ex. A, B, C, D, E, F, Tr. 39).\nHis performance evaluations show he was fully satisfactory in all factors, including\nproductivity and attendance, since he started working for his employer. He was\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n5\nmotivated to get the job done and required little supervision (Ex. L). Very dependable,\nhe worked overtime when asked and the quality of his work was \u201cexemplary\u201d (Ex. D). In\n2007, Applicant was formally recognized by his employer on two separate occasions for\nhis contributions in improving processes (Ex. K, Tr. 45-46). In March 2008, Applicant\nwas promoted to the salaried position of a senior operations analyst in the paint shop at\nan increase in his annual pay of between $10,000 and $15,000 depending on overtime\n(Tr. 40-41). Applicant\u2019s current supervisor requested that Applicant obtain a security\nclearance so that he can perform additional duties. He has found Applicant\u2019s reliability\nand trustworthiness to be above reproach and his judgment sound (Ex. E, Ex. F). An\nengineering specialist who has worked alongside Applicant since November 2005 has\nobserved that he works well under pressure. Applicant stays focused on his task, and\nhe is always punctual (Ex. A, Ex. B).\nOn July 1, 2008, Applicant underwent an hour long voluntary alcohol evaluation\nby a licensed social worker/counselor to prove he was not alcohol dependent (Ex. J, Tr.\n62). Asked to identify recent problems of concern to him, Applicant indicated he was\nusing alcohol to feel relaxed in social situations. The social worker deferred any\ndiagnosis pending further evaluation to rule out substance abuse/dependence. On July\n8, 2008, Applicant met with the social worker for another hour, and he provided a\nsubstance abuse history. He indicated he was drinking one to three beers, twice a\nweek, with last use on July 4, 2008. Applicant admitted he had consumed 30 beers per\nday for about 18 months from 2003 to 2005 but denied being intoxicated since. After\nalso reviewing a statement from Applicant\u2019s spouse in which she corroborated \u201cthe\npositive changes\u201d Applicant had made in his lifestyle, including his drinking, the social\nworker diagnosed Applicant with alcohol dependence in sustained full remission (Ex. J).\nIn February 2008, Applicant adopted his spouse\u2019s daughter (Tr. 86). In about\nOctober 2008, he and his spouse purchased their first home. Currently she does not\nwork outside the home (Tr. 37, 87-88).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n6\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG & 21: \u201cExcessive\nalcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure\nto control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and\nuntrustworthiness.\u201d Applicant had his first drink at age 18. While employed as an auto\nmechanic, he drank beer in moderation, including with coworkers. However, after going\nto work as a bartender in 1997, he began to drink daily and eventually in excessive\namount, about 30 beers per day. As evidenced by the expressed concerns of a former\ngirlfriend and of his roommate, his drinking was out of control by 2003. Following his job\nlayoff from the tavern and his marriage in December 2004, he experienced withdrawal\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n7\nsymptoms when he attempted to curb his consumption, and he continued to drink to\nabusive levels (about 20 beers daily after work). AG \u00b6 22(c) (\u201chabitual or binge\nconsumption of alcohol to the point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the\nindividual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent\u201d) applies. Given he\nwas diagnosed by a physician as suffering from alcohol dependence when he sought\ndetoxification treatment in August 2005, disqualifying condition AG \u00b6 22(d) (\u201cdiagnosis\nby a duly qualified medical professional (e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, or\npsychiatrist) of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence\u201d) also applies.\nApplicant offers in mitigation 11 months of abstinence from August 2005 to July\n2006 followed by two plus years of controlled drinking with no negative impact on his\nwork or family life. Applicant has not consumed alcohol to intoxication in the past three\nyears. Yet I am unable to apply mitigating condition AG \u00b6 23(a) (\u201cso much time has\npassed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d). He drank habitually to excess for\nmore than seven years, including after he was laid off from his job at the tavern.\nEmployment in the bar environment cannot fully explain his serious alcohol problem.\nNot everyone who works as a bartender develops alcohol dependency.\nApplicant\u2019s voluntary admission for detoxification in August 2005 is action taken\nto overcome his problem (see AG \u00b6 23(b), \u201cthe individual acknowledges his or her\nalcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome\nthis problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser)\u201d). But AG \u00b6 23(b) cannot be fully applied based\non the relatively short 11-month period of abstinence in comparison to his years of daily\nexcessive consumption leading to physiological dependence. Furthermore, Applicant\nhas shown little insight into his alcohol problem. When asked whether he felt he had a\ndrinking problem when he admitted himself for detoxification, Applicant responded, \u201cAt\nthat time, yeah\u201d (Tr. 56). By July 2006, when he felt he was ready to drink socially,\nApplicant did not think he had a drinking problem (\u201cI mean, you now, once you\u2019re, it\nseems like once you\u2019re labeled, you\u2019re labeled, but I felt I really didn\u2019t have any  kind of\ndrinking problem\u201d) (Tr. 57). The medical records shed little light on any specific insights\ngained by Applicant about his alcohol problem during his brief hospital stay, and his\ntestimony raises considerable concerns as to what he understands is required on his\npart to maintain sobriety for the long term. Asked about what he learned during his\ndetoxification, Applicant testified, \u201cWell, I wasn\u2019t really there to learn anything, I was\nthere to get myself off the, you know, get myself off the dependency\u201d (Tr. 51-52).\nIn July 2008, Applicant was evaluated by a licensed social worker to prove he is\nnot alcohol dependent. Based on Applicant\u2019s self-report, including that he was drinking\none to three beers twice a week, the social worker apparently concluded that the criteria\nfor dependence have not been met at any time during a period of at least 12 months\n(see Ex. 5), as he diagnosed Applicant with alcohol dependence, sustained full\n\nAlcohol detoxification may include counseling, but it is primarily medical treatment to withdraw a\n3\nperson from alcohol and to relieve the symptoms of that withdrawal. By relieving the physical dependence on\nalcohol, it prepares a person for rehabilitation, which includes counseling, psychological support, medical care,\nand therapy to educate about alcoholism and its effects, to ensure against future alcohol use/abuse.\nRehabilitation may incorporate family and social interventions to increase its effectiveness. The evidence does\nnot establish that Applicant underwent any alcohol rehabilitation following his detoxification.\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n8\nremission. There is independent validation for this qualifier in Applicant\u2019s excellent work\nrecord for his employer over the past three years. It is unlikely Applicant would have\nbeen able to sustain a high record of level if he was drinking to intoxication. At the same\ntime, the social worker validated the original diagnosis of alcohol dependence. He did\nnot offer a prognosis with respect to whether Applicant, who abused alcohol to the point\nof medically diagnosed dependence in the past, risks relapse by continuing to drink\nalcohol on a regular basis against medical advice to abstain.\nSince Applicant is not pursuing any treatment and is not involved in AA or similar\norganization, AG 23(c) (\u201cthe individual is a current employee who is participating in\ncounseling or a treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse,\nand is making satisfactory progress\u201d) does not apply. Even if I was to conclude that his\ndetoxification fulfilled the counseling requirement of AG \u00b6 23(d),  he lacks the favorable\n3\nprognosis, and compliance with aftercare and abstinence required for mitigation under\nthat mitigating condition (\u201cthe individual has successfully completed inpatient or\noutpatient counseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has\ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in\naccordance with treatment recommendations, such as participation in meetings of\nAlcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization and has received a favorable prognosis\nby a duly qualified medical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff\nmember of a recognized treatment program\u201d). \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the conduct\nand all the circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n9\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the\nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant bears a substantial burden of\nmitigation, especially where he does not fully satisfy any of the Guideline G mitigating\nconditions. With the help of a three-day detoxification in August 2005, and some informal\ndiscussions with a friend\u2019s father who has over 20 years of sobriety, Applicant managed\nto bring his alcohol dependency problem in full remission. At the same time, he\ncontinues to drink alcohol on a regular basis, with no appreciation that he might be\nrisking his sobriety by doing so. He elected not to pursue recommended aftercare\ncounseling, and has no formal support network in place to assist him should he find\nhimself drinking more in the future. His relationship with his friend\u2019s father is too sporadic\nfor this person to be considered even an informal sponsor. Discussions Applicant had\nwith him about alcohol (how you feel after you quit drinking, how to change your lifestyle)\nwere close to the time he finished his detoxification. Applicant testified that he has had\nlittle reason to initiate contact with him to discuss alcohol issues, although he did inform\nhim that he had resumed drinking. Regular drinking at even a reduced level of two to\nthree beers a couple times a week raises some doubt as to his commitment to his\nsobriety, given his extensive abuse in the past. I am unable to conclude that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for him.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section\nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\n\nFOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY\nWhen unredacted this document contains information\nEXEMPT FROM MANDATORY DISCLOSURE under the FOIA\nExemption 6 applies\n10\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.\nEligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \nELIZABETH M.

DeLaney, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMATCHINSKI, Elizabeth M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his security clearance application (SF 86) on March 16,\n2006. On January 28, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns\nunder Guideline G. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on February 14, 2008, and requested a\ndecision based on the record without a hearing. On March 10, 2008, the government\nsubmitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM) consisting of seven exhibits (Items 1-7).\nDOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant and instructed him to respond within\n30 days of receipt. Applicant submitted a response dated April 18, 2008, to which the\ngovernment had no objections. Applicant\u2019s  response was accepted as his Exhibit A. On\nMay 21, 2008\n\n2\nApril 29, 2008, the case was assigned to me to consider whether it is clearly consistent\nwith the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. Based\nupon a review of the FORM, including Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR allegations (Item\n3), and his rebuttal to the FORM (Ex. A), eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied.\nFindings of Fact\nDOHA alleged under Guideline G, alcohol consumption, that Applicant consumed\nalcohol at times to excess and intoxication from about 1990 to at least December 2007\nand was continuing to drink (SOR \u00b6 1.a), that he received outpatient treatment from\nMay 2003 to October 2003 for diagnosed alcohol dependence (SOR \u00b6 1.b), and that he\nwas convicted three times of operating while intoxicated (OWI) offenses: in April 2003\n(SOR \u00b6 1.c), February 1998 (SOR \u00b6 1.d), and October 1994 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). Applicant\nadmitted his three convictions for drunk driving, and that he had consumed alcohol at\ntimes to excess until his last offense in April 2003. He averred that since his last OWI,\nhe had successfully completed an alcohol abuse treatment program and had not\nabused alcohol. He described his consumption of alcohol as rare, a glass or two of beer\nor wine with family or close friends.\nAfter reviewing the evidence made available, I make the following findings of fact:\nApplicant is a 31-year-old project manager who has worked for his present\nemployer, a defense contractor, since November 1, 2007. From July 2004 to 2007, he\nworked as a financial analyst on several government programs, and it was during that\nemploy that he applied for a security clearance. His current employer has requested\nthat he be granted a clearance for his duties (Item 5, Item 6).\nApplicant began drinking alcohol at about age 15. In October 1994, when he was\n18, Applicant consumed several alcoholic beverages and then made \u201can extremely poor\ndecision\u201d to drive home from his friend\u2019s (Item 4, Item 6). Applicant was pulled over, to\nhis belief because his vehicle matched the description of one involved in a hit-and-run\nearlier that day. The officer smelled alcohol on his breath and he was arrested for OWI.\nDuring a search of his vehicle incident to the arrest, the officer found suspected\nmarijuana residue (seeds and stems). Applicant was charged with OWI, refusal,\npossession of drugs without a prescription, possession of drug paraphernalia, and hit\nand run\u2014property damage only. Applicant pleaded guilty willfully to OWI, and\nreluctantly on the advice of a public defender to possession without a prescription. He\ndenies he knowingly had any drugs or paraphernalia, and pleaded only because he had\nbeen told that the prosecutor would otherwise seek the maximum sentence on all\ncharges. The drug paraphernalia and hit-and-run charges were dismissed. Applicant\nwas sentenced to an alcohol/drug assessment, and a $629 fine or 25 days in jail. He\nalso lost his license for one year (Item 4, Item 6). Applicant apparently completed\ntreatment with some AA involvement in 1997, although the records of that treatment\nwere not made available for review (Item 7).\n\nApplicant indicated it was his fourth arrest for OW I (Item 4). W hen he was evaluated for alcohol problems in\n1\nMay 2003, he told the therapist evaluator that he had two drunk driving offenses in 1993 (Item 6, Item 7).\nRecords reviewed by the government reported an arrest in October 1994 that Applicant does not deny. It is\nlikely Applicant was mistaken about the date of his arrest. The government did not allege that Applicant had\nbeen arrested twice for drunk driving in the 1993/94 time frame, but records reviewing during its investigation\nof Applicant\u2019s background apparently confirmed the April 2003 OW I was Applicant\u2019s fourth drunk driving\noffense (tem 6). \n3\nIn November 1997, Applicant started his own production and design business. In\nFebruary 1998, Applicant was pulled over after drinking several alcoholic beverages at a\ntavern. He submitted to a breathalyzer and was arrested for OWI (repeater), and\noperating after revocation, first offense. He pleaded guilty and was fined $750 for the\nOWI and $95.50 for operating after revocation (Item 4, Item 6).\nIn September 1998, Applicant began attending a private university in his\nhometown. He continued to operate his business during his freshman year (Item 5). In\nDecember 1998, he was pulled over for speeding on the highway and arrested for\noperating after revocation/suspension. There is no evidence that alcohol was involved.\nThe charge was dismissed, although he acknowledges he made an \u201cextremely poor\ndecision\u201d by attempting to drive with a suspended license (Item 4, Item 6).\nDuring the summer of 2000, Applicant worked in technical support at a local\ntheater (Item 5). In August 2000, Applicant moved away to a distant state where he\ncontinued his undergraduate studies in political science and economics. He maintained\na high grade point average but found the college environment conducive to drinking and\nhis alcohol consumption increased (\u201cI found myself gravitating and eventually adapting\na lifestyle of alcohol abuse which included a lack of personal discipline and respect for\nauthority.\u201d Item 6).\nAfter he earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in late May 2002, Applicant returned to his\nhome state where he returned to work as a technical director at the theater. In about\nNovember 2002, Applicant broke up with a girlfriend whom he had dated for over three\nyears. His alcohol use increased to two to three days per week, two to eight beers per\noccasion (Item 6, Item 7). In late April 2003, Applicant consumed about five cocktails at\nhis brother\u2019s apartment. En route home, he came upon a traffic stop and was\napproached by the officer who smelled alcohol on his breath. Applicant was arrested for\nOWI, 4  offense, and operating with a blood alcohol content of .10% or more (Item 7).\nth\n1\nIn June 2003, he was sentenced on the OWI to a $2,680 fine, 36 months loss of license,\neight months in jail with credit for one day served with work privileges, and an alcohol\nand drug assessment. The blood alcohol content charge was dismissed (Item 4, Item\n6).\nOn May 5, 2003, Applicant was evaluated by a certified social worker (CSW) who\npossessed alcohol and drug counselor certification. Applicant claimed sobriety for one\nyear in 1997 with the assistance of a treatment program and Alcoholics Anonymous\n(AA), but acknowledged that his drinking had increased over the past six months.\nApplicant appeared to the CSW to be \u201cstruggling [with] the acceptance and surrender\n\n4\nprocess of his addiction,\u201d but he also verbalized a willingness to \u201cstay clean and sober.\u201d\nThe CSW rendered a diagnosis of alcohol dependency and recommended an intensive\noutpatient program, including individual and group therapy sessions. Applicant agreed\nto a treatment plan with a goal of developing and maintaining an alcohol-free lifestyle\n(Item 6, Item 7).\nOn May 14, 2003, Applicant underwent an assessment for impaired drivers. A\ncounselor diagnosed him as suffering from alcohol dependency in remission, with a\nrecurrent drinking pattern and moderately advanced chronicity. He was required to\ncomply with a driver safety plan order as a condition to licensing. Under the plan,\nApplicant was to complete an outpatient program, attend a victim impact panel in July\n2003, and maintain sobriety (Item 6, Item 7). \nApplicant received treatment in a four month two-phase outpatient program from\nMay 19, 2003, to October 6, 2003. He attended individual sessions once weekly and\ngroup therapy sessions twice weekly plus AA meetings. During a group session of June\n9, 2003, Applicant exhibited denial of his drinking problem, hoping he would be able to\nresume drinking after he got his life together. On August 27, 2003, he verbalized a\ncommitment to long-term sobriety. Having met his treatment goals, Applicant was\ndischarged on  October 6, 2003, with a good prognosis provided he continued with AA\nat least once a week (Item 6).\nFollowing his treatment, Applicant vowed to not abuse alcohol, to pursue a\nprofessional career, and to take care of himself \u201cmentally, physically, and emotionally.\u201d\nAfter completing the terms of his sentence for the OWI, Applicant moved away in\nFebruary 2004 to \u201cstart a new life.\u201d After a brief stay with an aunt, he moved to his\npresent area, and in July 2004 started working as an associate business consultant for\na federal contractor (Item 5, Item 6).\nApplicant supported several federal clients, including a naval command for which\nhe needed a security clearance (Item 6). On November 19, 2004, Applicant completed a\nSF 86, re-signed on March 16, 2006, on which he disclosed two convictions for OWI, in\nFebruary 1997 [sic] and April 2003, and one conviction in January 2000 [sic] for driving\nafter revocation. He listed counseling from June 2003 to October 2003 in response to\nquestion 30 concerning whether his use of alcohol had resulted in any alcohol-related\ntreatment or counseling in the last seven years, and explained:\nI sought out counseling in May 2003 to address alcohol problem. I\nsuccessfully completed an outpatient treatment program that was\ndesigned to address the impact of alcohol use/abuse and to promote a\nlifestyle change. This outpatient program consisted of one-on-one and\ngroup counseling sessions (Item 5).\nIn February 2005, the naval command recognized Applicant\u2019s outstanding\nperformance for his project management support on a multimillion dollar capital\ninvestment program for the command\u2019s installations and equipment office. Applicant\u2019s\n\n5\ncontributions were described as \u201ccomprehensive, complete, and accurate,\u201d and he was\nconsidered to be an \u201cinvaluable asset\u201d (Item 6). Applicant was given an achievement\naward by his employer for exemplary performance in serving the company and its\nclients (Item 6).\nIn October 2007, Applicant completed a contractual obligation supporting a\ngovernment agency\u2019s office of information technology. His duties had included the\ndevelopment and analysis of investment data (portfolio management support). His\nemployer chose not to bid on a \u201cre-compete\u201d task order. On November 1, 2007,\nApplicant went to work for his present employer who had successfully bid for the\ncontract. Applicant continued to support the same client on the same task order (Item 6,\nEx. A).\nIn response to interrogatories from DOHA concerning, in part, his alcohol use,\noffenses, and treatment, Applicant indicated on December 14, 2007, that he was\ncurrently consuming alcohol, a glass or two of beer or wine on occasion. He affirmed his\nintent to continue to drink \u201con rare occasion.\u201d Applicant indicated that he had received\nalcohol abuse counseling from May 2003 to October 2003. He also attended AA from\nMay 2003 to November 2003 five times per week but was not currently involved. As for\nhis future intentions of any AA, he indicated, \u201cMaybe, on occasion.\u201d Applicant provided\nfurther detail about his drinking, stating in part:\nAs part of my treatment program and personal regular personal inventory,\nI have learned to identify behavioral and situational triggers that have led\nto past alcohol abuse and have developed the coping skills to abstain from\nconsuming alcohol in all but rare situations where I consume a glass or\ntwo of beer or wine with family/close friends. These occasions are limited,\ndo not result in intoxication, and never occur when I will be driving or have\nany obligations/responsibilities to attend to.\nThe frequency of my occasional consumption of alcoholic beverages is not\npatterned. Sometimes I will consume a beer or wine beverage once or\ntwice a month. Other times I will not consume any alcohol for several\nweeks or months at a time. I will consume, at most, one or two alcoholic\nbeverages per occasion.\nIn describing his OWI offenses, Applicant acknowledged he had \u201cmade an\nextremely poor decision\u201d in each instance. As evidence of the personal changes he had\nmade since his treatment in 2003, Applicant volunteered that he had purchased his\npresent residence in August 2006, paid off debt accumulated while in college, and was\nmaintaining a sober lifestyle (\u201cI no longer associate with people that abuse alcohol and\nspend my time outside of my professional career working on my house, exercising\nregularly, and reading.\u201d). Applicant expressed his \u201csincere intention and desire to\ncontinue to maintain and improve [his] current lifestyle as well as further [his] career in\nsupport of the Federal government.\u201d He was hoping to begin master\u2019s degree studies on\na part-time basis (Item 4, Item 6, Ex. A).\n\n6\nIn rebuttal to the government\u2019s FORM, Applicant indicated on April 17, 2008, that\nhe has not had a relapse since he changed his lifestyle nearly five years ago. He\nexpressed his understanding of the personal and professional integrity required of a\nsecurity clearance and his confidence that he would continue to maintain the integrity\nand professionalism required (Ex. A).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\n \n\n7\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for alcohol consumption is set out\nin AG & 21: \u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable\njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability and untrustworthiness.\u201d Applicant had his first drink at age 15. The\nrecord before me for review contains little detail about his consumption in terms of\nfrequency or quantity. Applicant does not deny, however, and his OWI convictions\nconfirm, that he abused alcohol on repeated occasions until his most recent arrest in\nApril 2003. His drunk driving offenses raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 22(a)\n(\u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under the influence,\nfighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of concern,\nregardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol\ndependent\u201d). When evaluated for possible treatment after the OWI, he told a CSW that\nhis drinking had escalated to two to eight beers two to three times a week in the\nprevious six months. Presumably, this level of drinking and the OWI offenses are what\nled the CSW to diagnose him as alcohol dependent, and because of that diagnosis AG\n\u00b6 22(e) (\u201cevaluation of alcohol abuse or alcohol dependence by a licensed clinical social\nworker who is a staff member of a recognized alcohol treatment program\u201d) also applies.\nYet, while consumption of eight beers over a limited time period can reasonably be\nconsidered binge drinking, it is not clear how often or over how many hours Applicant\ndrank as many as eight beers. AG \u00b6 22(c) (\u201chabitual or binge consumption of alcohol to\nthe point of impaired judgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an\nalcohol abuser or alcohol dependent\u201d) has limited applicability in this case.\nTo Applicant\u2019s credit, he obtained an alcohol assessment after his April 2003\nOWI but before he was sentenced. He completed the intensive outpatient counseling\nprogram in October 2003 with a good prognosis, albeit one conditioned on continued\nAA. He moved away from the environment and persons conducive to abusive drinking,\nand over the past five years established a record of sobriety and significant professional\naccomplishment. While taking the position that the mitigating evidence \u201carguably\nsupports\u201d application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a), 23(b), and 23(d), Department Counsel contends\nApplicant has not met his burden of mitigation, citing Applicant\u2019s struggles with\naccepting his problem, his failure to attend AA at present, and his continued drinking. \nApplicant makes a credible case for application of AG \u00b6 23(a) (\u201cso much time has\npassed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d), given the absence of any\n\nIn December 2007, Applicant indicated that he sometimes consumed beer or wine (no more than one or two\n2\nper occasion) once or twice a month. Yet at other times, he did not drink for several weeks or months at a time\n(Item 4).\n8\nindication of intoxication or alcohol-related impairment since the April 2003 OWI. Yet,\nbecause he was diagnosed with alcohol dependency in 2003, the passage of time alone\nis not enough to guarantee against a relapse (see AG \u00b6 23(b) (\u201cthe individual\nacknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol abuse, provides evidence of\nactions taken to overcome this problem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if\nalcohol dependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser\u201d) and AG \u00b6 23(d) (\u201cthe\nindividual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation\nalong with any required aftercare, has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of\nmodified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations,\nsuch as participation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar organization and\nhas received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional or a\nlicensed clinical social worker who is a staff member of a recognized treatment\nprogram\u201d). The successful completion of outpatient counseling and his frequent\nattendance at AA in 2003 satisfy the treatment requirements set out in AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b) and\n23(d). The lifestyle changes Applicant has made since his treatment indicate some\nrecognition on his part that alcohol was causing him a problem, which is required under\nAG \u00b6 23(b) and is a precondition for a finding of successful completion of a treatment\nprogram under AG \u00b6 23(d). Progress notes reflect that as of June 11, 2003, he\ncontinued to deny his problem, but by mid-August 2003, he was focused on his sobriety.\nHis alcohol dependence was in remission as of October 2003.\nApplicant was given a good prognosis on his discharge from the outpatient\nprogram in October 2003, provided he continued with AA once weekly. He went to AA\nmeetings for only about a month or so after his discharge. At the same time, he made\nsignificant lifestyle changes (geographic relocation, dissociation with the persons and\nemployment that contributed to his abusive drinking, pursuit of a professional career)\nthat could support a favorable prognosis but have not been clinically evaluated.\nUnder AG \u00b6 23(b), a \u201cpattern of abstinence\u201d is also required for mitigation of\ndiagnosed alcohol dependency. AG \u00b6 23(d) requires \u201ca clear and established pattern of\nmodified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations.\u201d\nConsistent application of the Guideline G conditions leads me to conclude that Applicant\nbe required to demonstrate an established pattern of abstinence for either AG \u00b6 23(b) or\n23(d) to fully apply. What is known of Applicant\u2019s recent drinking is that after \u201ca\nsustained period of sobriety\u201d (Item 6), he resumed drinking sometime before December\n2007, albeit in quantity of no more than one or two glasses of beer or wine in no set\npattern.  On May 5, 2003, he signed a treatment plan that had a stated goal of\n2\ndeveloping and maintaining an alcohol-free lifestyle. While he had achieved that goal as\nof October 2003 (see Item 6) his drinking even in moderate amount at present would\nappear to be inconsistent with that goal. So while Applicant has shown good judgment\nin completing the outpatient treatment program, AG \u00b6 23(b) and 23(d) are only partly\napplicable. The remaining mitigating condition, AG \u00b6 23(c) (\u201cthe individual is a current\n\n9\nemployee who is participating in counseling or treatment program, has no history of\nprevious treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory progress\u201d) does not apply on\nits face since Applicant is not currently in treatment. There is also some indication in the\nrecord that Applicant had prior treatment in 1997, which would make AG \u00b623(c)\ninapplicable.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s repeated drunk driving\n(at least three if not four incidents) raises very serious doubts for his judgment and\nability to comply with rules and regulations. His first OWI offenses were committed\nbefore he turned 22, but his last OWI cannot reasonably be attributed to immaturity.\nWhile he did not allow his alcohol use to affect his studies in college, he turned to\nalcohol in late 2002 to cope with the breakup of a longtime dating relationship. After his\nlast OWI in April 2003, he successfully completed an intensive outpatient rehabilitation\nprogram and starting in February 2004, made several lifestyle changes. He moved\naway from his old environment and found challenging professional employment in which\nhe has excelled. As evidence of the maturity that comes with age, he paid off the credit\ncard debt accumulated in college and took on the financial responsibility of home\nownership. He hopes to pursue his master\u2019s degree part-time while continuing his\ncontractor employment.\nHowever, he was assessed by two different counselors in May 2003 and\ndiagnosed not with alcohol abuse, but with the more serious problem of alcohol\ndependence. A desire to resume drinking was viewed by his group counselor in June\n2003 as evidence of ongoing denial of his problem. Without a recent clinical evaluation\nindicating that he was misdiagnosed in 2003 or that he does not risk a relapse by\ncontinuing to drink, I am unable to conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national\ninterest to grant him access.\n\nTreatment is viewed favorably, but the allegation is resolved against him because his ongoing consumption\n3\nis contrary to his treatment goal.\n10\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant3\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

Michael Lyles, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nLOUGHRAN, Edward W., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant mitigated the security concerns raised by his financial history. Eligibility \nfor access to classified information is granted.  \n \nOn November 9, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on November 27, 2007, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to another \nAdministrative Judge on January 9, 2008, and reassigned to me on February 4, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on January 28, 2008. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled on February 20, 2008. The government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, \nMarch 12, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \nwhich were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and \nsubmitted Exhibits (AE) A through C, without objection. One witness testified on \nApplicant\u2019s behalf. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until March 3, \n2008, to submit additional matters. Applicant submitted 90 pages of documents which \nwere marked AE D though V, and admitted without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s \nmemo is marked Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. The record closed on March 3, 2008. DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on February 28, 2008.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated November 30, 2007, Applicant admitted all the \nfactual allegations in the SOR, with explanations. He also provided additional \ninformation to support his request for eligibility for a security clearance.   \n \n \nApplicant is a 58-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He served in the \nU.S. Marine Corps from 1967 to 1971, and was honorably discharged. He has an \nequivalency degree from high school obtained while he was in the Marine Corps. His \nmarriage from 1970 to 1973 ended in divorce. He remarried in 1975. He and his wife \nhave a 23-year-old daughter and he adopted his wife\u2019s two children.1  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife was laid off from her employment in about 1998, and was \nunemployed or underemployed until 2000. Applicant had continuous employment with a \ncompany from 1988 through 2000. His employer sold his division to another company in \n2000. He continued to be employed by the successor company. Applicant traveled \nfrequently for his company and received many hours of overtime pay. He and his wife \ncame to rely on the overtime. After the events of September 11, 2001, his company \nchanged their philosophy and essentially ended his travel and overtime. He was notified \nin 2002 that he was on the list of employees to be laid off and that he should start \nlooking for other employment. Applicant started working on adding a garage to his \nhouse before his employment became a concern. He accumulated credit card and other \ndebt for the costs of the addition. In preparation of their imminent financial issues \nrelated to his employment, Applicant went through a debt consolidation program as a \nmeans of lowering interest rates on their debts. The plan called for Applicant to pay \n$1,635 per month to the company which disbursed the funds to his creditors. The \npayments were lowered to $1,410 in January 2003. He made payments every month \nfrom March 2002 through May 2003.2 \n \n \nApplicant refinanced his mortgage in December 2002. Creditors were paid as \npart of the settlement. An auto financing company was paid $17,528; a financing \ncompany was paid $11,399 for his tractor; and two bank/financial institutions were paid \n$10,158 and $4,518.3  \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 17-18, 56-59; GE 1. \n \n2 Tr. at 19-20, 37-41, 44, 60; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 1, 2; GE A, F. \n \n3 Tr. at 38; GE 2; AE E, G. \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant withdrew $48,880 from his 401(k) retirement account in 2002, which \ntriggered serious tax consequences. Applicant was ignorant of the tax ramifications. He \nwas told that there was a 10% penalty, but did not consider that the $48,880 would be \ntaxed as income. Only $799 in federal income tax was withheld from the disbursement. \nApplicant paid a professional $1,000 to review his 2002 tax return and attempt to work \nout a payment plan with the state and the IRS, if necessary. The professional did not \nhandle the return expeditiously. Despite numerous requests from Applicant, the return \nwas not prepared to be filed until June 2004. He owed the IRS more than $21,000 for \ntax year 2002. Applicant withdrew an additional $14,924 from his retirement account in \n2004. $2,238 was withheld for federal income tax and $746 was withheld for state tax.4 \n \n \nApplicant made a payment plan with the IRS in August 2004, to pay $220 every \nmonth. The IRS also retained any refunds due Applicant for subsequent tax years. In \nFebruary 2008, the IRS removed the penalties for failure to file and pay for tax year \n2002. The IRS credited Applicant with $5,272 for penalties and interest from his 2002 \nreturn. They applied $3,708 toward his debt for tax year 2004, and stated he would \nreceive at least $1,560 in a refund. With this action, all the back taxes owed to the IRS \nhave been resolved. He made a payment plan with his state to pay $75 per month, \nwhich was increased to $100 per month in August 2007. The balance owed to the state \nas of February 8, 2008 was $2,235. Applicant intends to pay an additional $220 to the \nstate with the money he was using to pay the IRS. With the additional payments, the \nstate will be paid within about seven months.5 \n \n \nApplicant was laid off from his company in about November 2003. He was \nunemployed or underemployed, working sporadically, until he was hired by his current \nemployer in August 2005.6 \n \n \nThe SOR alleges five delinquent debts totaling approximately $63,227. Individual \ndebts are discussed below. \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a debt of $18,588 to a financial institution for a credit card \naccount. This debt was included in Applicant\u2019s debt consolidation program in 2002 and \n2003. The financial institution forgave the debt and issued an IRS Form 1099-C \ncancelling the debt of $16,564 on December 31, 2006. This means that Applicant no \nlonger owes and the creditor no longer expects payment on the debt. This can have tax \nconsequences and a taxpayer could be required to pay income tax on the amount of the \nforgiven debt. An exception is when the taxpayer is insolvent. Applicant addressed this \non his tax return for tax year 2006, certifying that he and his wife were insolvent.7  \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 20-22, 42-46, 68-69; AE I, K, M. Applicant\u2019s tax debts were not alleged in the SOR and \nare not considered for disqualifying purposes, but may be used when viewing Applicant\u2019s overall financial \nsituation, when analyzing the \u201cwhole person,\u201d and the potential application of mitigating conditions. \n \n5 Tr. at 32, 60-63; AE C, I-K, M, N, P, S, U. \n \n6 Tr. at 20-22, 36; GE 1. \n \n7 Tr. at 19-20, 63-71; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 1, 2; AE A, F. \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nAn IRS Form 1099-C, cancelling the debt of $6,946 as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c, was \nissued by the creditor on November 1, 2007. This debt was also included in Applicant\u2019s \ndebt consolidation program in 2002 and 2003.8 \n \n \nApplicant admitted to the debts of $12,813, $5,652, and $19,228, as alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e. He entered into a payment plan in March 2005, with the \ncreditor from SOR \u00b6 1.d to pay $75 per month. Applicant made payments of $2,625 to \nthat creditor. The balance on the debt as of February 25, 2008, was $4,969. Once the \ntax debt to his state is paid, he will then use that additional money to pay the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.d. Applicant has not made any payments on the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.e. \nHis intent is to pay all his delinquent debts. His plan is pay the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.d, then \nmove to the next debt.9 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s debt consolidation program in 2002 to 2003 did not include financial \ncounseling and he has not received any counseling since then. He chose not to file for \nbankruptcy because he wanted to pay his debts. Applicant and his wife help their \ndaughter in college, but otherwise they have severely cut back on their expenses and \nlive frugally. He still has not finished building the garage because of the costs.10 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s manager wrote a letter on his behalf noting his professional job \nperformance and integrity. Applicant discussed his financial situation with his manager \nand his manager recommends him for a security clearance.11 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, Administrative Judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative \nJudge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must \nconsider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable \nand unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n                                                          \n8 Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 2; AE Q. \n \n9 Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 2; AE A, U. \n \n10 Tr. at 35-36, 49-51, 76; Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR; GE 2; AE A. \n \n11 AE C. \n \n\n \n5 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable to pay his \nobligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise the above potentially \ndisqualifying conditions. \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \nApplicant had steady employment with the same company for 13 years and \nearned a good salary with plenty of travel and overtime. This continued after the \ncompany was bought in 2000. He planned on building a garage and accumulated credit \ncard and other debt for the addition. Things started to change in about the fall of 2001. \nHis company curtailed his travel and overtime, which substantially lowered his income. \nHe was notified in 2002 that a lay off was coming and he was laid off in about \nNovember 2003. He was unemployed or underemployed until he was hired by his \ncurrent employer in August 2005. \n \n \nApplicant started preparing for the financial consequences of his diminished pay \nand loss of employment well in advance of the lay off. He went through a debt \nconsolidation program and paid $1,635 into the program every month from March 2002 \nthrough December 2002, and the lowered $1,410 payments from January 2003 until \nMay 2003, when he could no longer maintain the payments. He refinanced his \n\n \n7 \n \nmortgage in December 2002, and paid creditors more than $43,000 as part of the \nsettlement.  \n \n \nApplicant withdrew $48,880 from his 401(k) retirement account in 2002. Through \nignorance or poor advice, he was unaware of the tax consequences. He owed the IRS \nmore than $21,000 for tax year 2002. He made a payment plan with the IRS in August \n2004, to pay $220 every month. The debt to the IRS is now paid. He made a payment \nplan with his state to pay $75 per month, which was increased to $100 per month in \nAugust 2007. He intends to pay an additional $220 to the state with the money he was \nusing to pay the IRS. The state will be paid within about seven months. \n \n \nTwo of the debts in the SOR were formally forgiven by the creditors. He has paid \none creditor $75 per month since March 2005. His intent is to pay all his delinquent \ndebts. Once the state is paid, he will then use that additional money to add to the $75 \nhe is paying the one creditor. He will then move to the next debt. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are directly related to his unemployment and \nunderemployment. These are conditions that were largely beyond his control. He \nstarted addressing his financial issues even before he was laid off, when his overtime \nwas cut off. He handled his debts as well as he could for as long as he could. Once he \nwas working consistently again, he started paying his debts. He began regularly paying \nthe IRS in 2004, and he also instituted payment plans with the state and the creditor \nfrom SOR \u00b6 1.d. The debt to the IRS is paid, and the debt to the state will be paid within \na reasonable period. He will then use the extra money on the remaining debts. I find \nthat Applicant is acting responsibly under the circumstances and his actions constitute a \ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors. AG \u00b6 20(b) is applicable and AG \u00b6 20(d) is \npartially applicable. He has not received counseling but there are clear indications that \nhis financial problems are being resolved and are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) is partially \napplicable. No other mitigating condition is completely applicable. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n\n \n8 \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant served honorably in the \nMarine Corps from 1967 to 1971. He worked for the same company from 1988 through \n2000. He was earning a good salary, traveling and working many hours of overtime. His \njob continued after his company sold his division in 2000. The new company essentially \neliminated his travel and overtime in 2001, and he was laid off in 2003. Applicant has \nnot ignored his financial responsibilities; he has attempted to address them to the best \nof his ability. He refinanced his mortgage in December 2002. Creditors were paid more \nthan $43,000 as part of the settlement. Applicant withdrew $48,880 from his 401(k) in \n2002, and an additional $14,924 in 2004. He was unprepared for the serious tax \nconsequences triggered by the withdrawals. It took him years, but he paid the IRS, and \nis on the verge of paying off the state. He has regularly paid one creditor since March \n2005. Applicant chose not to file bankruptcy. His intent is to pay all his delinquent debts. \nThe money that was used to pay the IRS will go to pay the state, and then the next \ncreditor. He has worked for his current employer since August 2005, and is highly \nregarded. He and his wife live very frugally. He sincerely, candidly, and credibly testified \nabout his finances, and his desire to correct his problems.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial issues.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1e: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations set forth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c (in part), 1.e, and 2.a. He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f, 3.a, and 3.b. Applicant\u2019s admissions, including those contained in his response to DOHA Interrogatories (GE 3), are incorporated in the following findings. Applicant is a 37-year-old former Army Ranger communications warrant officer who is employed by a defense contractor. He was selected for promotion to warrant officer as an E-5 with only seven years of service, well ahead of his peers. He is one of only two communications warrant officers to ever complete Ranger training. He is married with four children. His wife does not work outside the home. The allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.c, that Applicant was contacted by the local sheriff\u2019s office for a liquor law violation in March 1988 but was neither arrested nor charged, is technically correct. The implication that he committed the violation, however, is not correct. He was 17 years old at the time, and his older brother and some friends were drinking underage while their parents were away from home. The sheriff, who lived next door, came over to investigate the gathering of teenagers and discovered the older, but still underage, kids drinking. Applicant was not involved in the party, nor had he consumed any alcohol. Accordingly, he was neither arrested nor charged because he committed no violation. (Answer at 2; AE E at 2; Tr. at 64-65.)

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant was convicted of committing alcohol-related vehicular homicide after a\none-car accident in February 2002 in which his passenger was killed. He served 24\nmonths in prison. He established that this was a one-time incident completely out of\ncharacter, and from which he is rehabilitated. The Army mishandled his administrative\nseparation and erroneously overpaid him more than $35,000. He legitimately disputed\nthis, and one other reportedly-delinquent debt, and resolved both. Based upon a review\nof the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted. \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on January 16,\n2006. On February 29, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nF, G, and J for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nAugust 20, 2008\n\n2\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 11, 2008. He answered\nthe SOR in writing (Answer) on March 12, 2008, and requested a hearing before an\nAdministrative Judge. DOHA received that request on March 17, 2008. Department\nCounsel was prepared to proceed on April 17, 2008, and the case was assigned to me\non April 25, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 6, 2008, and I convened the\nhearing as scheduled on May 29, 2008. The Government offered exhibits (GE) 1\nthrough 7, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf,\nand submitted exhibits (AE) A through H, which were admitted without objection. DOHA\nreceived the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on June 5, 2008.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the factual allegations set forth in\nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c (in part), 1.e, and 2.a. He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.f,\n3.a, and 3.b. Applicant\u2019s admissions, including those contained in his response to\nDOHA Interrogatories (GE 3), are incorporated in the following findings.\nApplicant is a 37-year-old former Army Ranger communications warrant officer\nwho is employed by a defense contractor. He was selected for promotion to warrant\nofficer as an E-5 with only seven years of service, well ahead of his peers. He is one of\nonly two communications warrant officers to ever complete Ranger training. He is\nmarried with four children. His wife does not work outside the home.\nThe allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.c, that Applicant was contacted by the local sheriff\u2019s\noffice for a liquor law violation in March 1988 but was neither arrested nor charged, is\ntechnically correct. The implication that he committed the violation, however, is not\ncorrect. He was 17 years old at the time, and his older brother and some friends were\ndrinking underage while their parents were away from home. The sheriff, who lived next\ndoor, came over to investigate the gathering of teenagers and discovered the older, but\nstill underage, kids drinking. Applicant was not involved in the party, nor had he\nconsumed any alcohol. Accordingly, he was neither arrested nor charged because he\ncommitted no violation. (Answer at 2; AE E at 2; Tr. at 64-65.)\nIn 1991, when beginning advanced individual training after competing basic\ntraining, Applicant drank beer in a barracks parking lot with some older soldiers he had\nbefriended. He was not supposed to drink in that area, and was underage. He received\nminor non-judicial punishment under Article 15, UCMJ. (GE 1; Answer at 1; Tr. at 100-\n102.)\nOn February 17, 2002, Applicant and a friend spent the afternoon at Applicant\u2019s\nbrother\u2019s house. They drank some beer. That evening, Applicant and the friend drove\nback to Applicant\u2019s house and took his other car, a new \u201cBullet Mustang\u201d for a drive. His\nwife said she saw him briefly when he arrived home to change cars, and she did not\n\n3\nconsider him to be impaired at that point. Some 20 to 60 minutes after leaving the\nhouse, they had a very severe high-speed one-car accident in which the friend was\nkilled and Applicant suffered a broken neck. The car was so badly damaged that\nresponding police had difficulty determining which of the two men had been driving. At\nthe conclusion of the investigation, on July 13, 2002, Applicant was arrested and\ncharged with vehicular homicide. Laboratory test results, which he does not question,\nrevealed that he had a blood-alcohol content (BAC) of .21 shortly after the accident.\nSince the accident, he has had no memory of anything that occurred after leaving his\nbrother\u2019s house, and has no idea how his blood alcohol level got so high. After a\ncontested trial, he was convicted in March 2003 of vehicular homicide and subsequently\nsentenced to serve 36 months confinement. He was actually imprisoned for 24 months\nfrom May 2003 to May 2005, after which he was under Department of Corrections\nsupervision until January 2007. On January 13, 2007, he received a Certificate and\nOrder of Discharge, stating that he had met all requirements of his conviction and\nsentence, and restoring his civil rights other than those involving possession or\ntransportation of firearms. (GE 3; GE 4 at 105, 114; Answer at 1; Tr. at 53-62, 102-108,\n116.)\nApplicant\u2019s sentence also required him to be assessed and appropriately treated\nfor any alcohol abuse or dependency issues. His initial assessment reflected him to be\nlow-risk, and therefore ineligible for the prison treatment programs designed for more\nserious cases. When he left prison for work-release, he was again assessed and\nrecommended to attend a six-month outpatient education course of treatment. He\nsuccessfully completed that program on January 12, 2006. There is no evidence that he\nwas ever diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or alcohol dependent. Accordingly, on motion\nof Department Counsel to conform the SOR to the evidence, I granted that motion and\ndeleted SOR \u00b6 1.f. Both Applicant\u2019s case manager and the clinical director of the state-\nlicensed treatment facility stated that his prognosis was considered very favorable. He\nwas not directed to refrain from any future alcohol use. He convincingly testified that he\nhad very much learned the error of his choice to drink and drive in February 2002, and\nhas prioritized his activities and interests to prevent recurrence. Applicant first\nconsumed beer at age 19 and subsequently, when duty and family commitments\npermitted, was a light to moderate social drinker of mostly beer until his accident in\n2002. Between then and early 2007, he did not drink at all. Between January and June\n2007, he drank two to four beers per week, on average. Because he has been busy with\nwork, school, and family, and he felt no desire to do so, he has not drunk any alcohol\nsince June 2007. (GE 4 at 103; Answer at 2-3; AE C; AE H; Tr. at 65-69, 72-79.)  \nWhen Applicant went to prison in May 2003, the Army mishandled and misplaced\nhis administrative separation paperwork. As a result, his pay continued going to his\nbank account for about nine months after he used up his leave balance and should\nhave been transferred into a non-pay status. When his pay was eventually stopped, he\nhad received $35,668 to which he was not actually entitled. He initiated multiple\nattempts to have this indebtedness investigated and waived due to Government error.\nAfter exhausting these attempts to have the debt forgiven without success, he and the\nTreasury Department collection agent agreed to a lump-sum $30,000 settlement. He\n\n4\nrefinanced his home and paid the full settlement amount in January 2008. His April 9,\n2008 credit bureau report (CBR) reflects this debt as a paid collection with a zero\nbalance. (GE 6 at 2; Answer at 3, 6, 7; AE B; Tr. at 32-33, 42-46, 50-53, 83-96.)\nThe other debt reported to be in collection on Applicant\u2019s September 2007 CBR\nwas an original $560 medical bill. This issue arose when Applicant\u2019s medical provider\nerroneously coded a bill to his medical insurance company, resulting in denial of the\nclaim. Although he was working with the provider and the insurance company to resolve\nthe confusion, the provider sent the bill to collections in June 2007. Once they did that,\nApplicant paid the bill the following month to clear his credit and continued to work to\nresolve the dispute. By mid-August, a properly coded bill had been paid by his\ninsurance. Applicant worked for the next three months to convince all concerned of the\nmistake, and the collection agent returned his $560 in November 2007. It no longer\nappears on his CBR, the most recent of which reflects no delinquent debts, one auto\nloan for about $18,000 and only $158 in credit card debt. Applicant\u2019s budget reflects a\nsteady monthly surplus of income over expenses, and he remains current on all his\nfinancial obligations despite having served two years in prison from 2003 to 2005. He\nreceived financial counseling to assist with maintaining family solvency despite this\nsevere income turbulence. (GE 5, GE 6, Answer at 4, 8; AE A; AE E at 2; Tr. at 28-31,\n47-50, 80-83, 96-100.)\nApplicant submitted many character letters, from current and former colleagues\nand supervisors. These letters attest to his outstanding character and integrity, his\nsuperior performance of highly classified work in the special forces, often in combat\nsettings, and his successful rehabilitation and strong work performance since the 2002\nvehicular homicide incident. He is working full time and has been diligently pursuing a\nbachelor\u2019s degree since leaving active duty. He testified credibly that he is dedicated to\ncontinuing his service defending the national interests, and to never again risk all he\nholds dear through irresponsible behavior like his conduct on February 17, 2002. (AE D;\nAE E; AE F; AE G; Tr. at 76-79, 116-118.)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\n\n5\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nProcedural Issues\nThe SOR cited facts that would have brought Applicant\u2019s case under the\nprohibitions of the Smith Amendment (10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986), because he was convicted and\nsentenced to 36 months for vehicular homicide, of which he served 24 months.\nHowever, this section of the United States Code, which applied only to clearances\ngranted by DoD, was repealed on January 28, 2008, when the President signed the\nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 into law. It was replaced by\nadding Sec. 3002 to 50 U.S.C. \u00a7 435b (the Bond Amendment), which applies\nthroughout the Federal Government. Sec. 3002(c) of this new provision continues the\nrequirement for disqualification, absent a meritorious waiver, for persons who were\nsentenced to and served imprisonment for more than a year. However, this\ndisqualification only applies to prevent clearances that would provide access to special\naccess programs (SAP), Restricted Data (RD), or any other information commonly\nreferred to as \u201cspecial compartmented information\u201d (SCI). \n\n6\nThis statutory modification ends the former Smith Amendment requirement for a\nmeritorious Secretarial waiver to grant or continue a regular, or \u201ccollateral,\u201d security\nclearance to a person who has served more than a year on a criminal sentence. On\nJune 20, 2008, subsequent to the issuance of the SOR and the hearing in this case, the\nUnder Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) issued a memorandum providing interim\nguidance for implementation of the Bond Amendment. This memorandum set forth\nguidance for adjudicators to assess the potential application of the Bond Amendment to\nsecurity clearance determinations and requirements for \u201cException\u201d identification of\npersons subject to its limitations in the Joint Adjudication Management System (JAMS)\nif a collateral clearance is granted. The granting of access to SAP, RD or SCI to such\nindividuals requires a meritorious waiver under the terms of that memorandum. Such\naccess is not at issue in this case, and accordingly the Bond Amendment was not\naddressed in either the SOR or at the hearing.\nThe repeal of the Smith Amendment also nullified the legal authority by which the\nUnder Secretary of Defense for Intelligence modified the revised Adjudicative\nGuidelines (AG) that were approved by the President on December 29, 2005. When the\nUnder Secretary promulgated the AG for use within DoD, on August 30, 2006, he added\nprovisions reflecting the Smith Amendment. AG H (Drug Involvement), AG I\n(Psychological Conditions), and AG J (Criminal Conduct) were each modified, but only\nthe latter guideline is involved in this case. It was modified by adding \u00b6\u00b6 31(f), 32(e),\nand footnotes 1 and 2. Because the President, in Executive Order 12968, intended to\nestablish \u201ca uniform Federal personnel security program\u201d (Intro.), and required a\n\u201ccommon set of adjudicative guidelines for determining eligibility for access to classified\ninformation\u201d (Sec. 3.1(f).), the authority for these DoD modifications to the guidelines\nended with the repeal of the Smith Amendment. The new statutory requirements are in\neffect and must be followed pending formal revision of the AG, but only the prohibition\nagainst granting clearances to unlawful drug users and addicts under AG H applies to\n\u201ccollateral\u201d security clearances. Accordingly, the Smith Amendment-related provisions\nadded to AG J have been repealed, and do not apply to the remaining proceedings in\nthis case.    \nAnalysis\nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption\nAG \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption:\n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or\nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability\nand trustworthiness.\u201d AG \u00b6 22 describes conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying. The disqualifying condition asserted by the Government in\nthis case is: \u201c(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under\nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other incidents of\nconcern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol abuser or\nalcohol dependent.\u201d\n\n7\nApplicant had one alcohol-related vehicular homicide conviction for an incident in\nFebruary 2002. He also received minor non-judicial punishment for prohibited\nconsumption of beer while underage and in a training status in April 1991. The\nGovernment has established security concerns under this guideline, shifting the burden\nof proof to Applicant to mitigate those concerns.\nAG \u00b6 23 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or\ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness,\nor good judgment;\n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of alcohol\nabuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and\nhas established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol dependent) or\nresponsible use (if an alcohol abuser);\n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a counseling\nor treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and relapse,\nand is making satisfactory progress; and\n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient\ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has\ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as\nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar\norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified\nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff\nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program.\nApplicant established mitigation under \u00b6 23(a) with respect to his two alcohol\nincidents, both individually and collectively. The 1991 incident was 17 years ago and\noccurred when he was young and not authorized to drink the beer provided to him by\nthose who were authorized to drink it. Those conditions no longer exist. The tragic 2002\nincident, in which Applicant was convicted of driving recklessly with a BAC of .21\nresulting in a crash in which his friend died and he suffered a broken neck, occurred six\nand a half years ago and was a one-time exercise of terrible judgment. He suffered\nsevere consequences, and the evidence established that any recurrence of such\nconduct is highly unlikely. With the passage of time and Applicant\u2019s conduct in the\ninterim, this one-time behavior no longer casts doubt on his current reliability,\ntrustworthiness and good judgment. Although never diagnosed with alcohol dependence\nor alcohol abuse, he did acknowledge that the vehicular homicide was an alcohol-\nrelated exercise of terrible judgment, and took responsible steps to prevent recurrence.\nHe successfully completed his court-ordered outpatient education treatment program,\nand completely abstained from alcohol from 2002 to early 2007. Both his case manager\n\n8\nand the program\u2019s clinical director gave him a very favorable prognosis upon completion\nof the program. For about six months in 2007 he engaged in very moderate and\nresponsible consumption of beer. He has recently abstained from alcohol for more than\na year \u2013 not because he was advised to abstain, but because his work, education and\nfamily priorities cause him to choose not to drink. These actions generate further\nmitigation of alcohol consumption security concerns under \u00b6\u00b6 23(b) and 23(d). \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct, \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying. Disqualifying conditions asserted by the Government were:\n\u201c(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses;\u201d and \u201c(c) allegation or admission\nof criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally\nprosecuted or convicted.\u201d (Tr. at 110.) Applicant admitted both the unauthorized drinking\noffense in 1991 and the vehicular homicide in 2002. These offenses do raise security\nconcerns under the aforementioned disqualifying conditions. Applicant\u2019s conviction and\nincarceration for 24 months would also implicate AG \u00b6 31(f), \u201cconviction in a Federal or\nState court, including a court-martial of a crime, sentenced to imprisonment for a term\nexceeding one year and incarceration as a result of that sentence for not less than a\nyear.\u201d As discussed above, however, this provision was added to the AG for purposes\nof DoD adjudications as a result of the now-repealed Smith Amendment. It was added\nbecause this disqualifying condition could not formerly be mitigated except through a\nSecretarial meritorious waiver. This is no longer the law, and this disqualifying condition\nis now redundant with the \u201csingle serious crime,\u201d under AG \u00b6 31(a).\nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security\nconcerns. Applicant\u2019s recent sobriety, completion of an outpatient treatment program,\ngood work performance, pursuit of higher education and lifestyle changes establish\nmitigation under two of them: \u201c(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\u201d and \u201c(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not\nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive\ncommunity involvement.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s criminal conduct occurred many years ago, but his criminal history\nmust be evaluated as a whole, not piece by piece. Although both incidents involved\nalcohol, they were very different in nature and scope. His 1991 prohibited consumption\nof a beer given to him by senior personnel reflected a lapse of discipline and was\ntreated accordingly by his command. He subsequently proved that he learned his\nlesson by superior military performance leading to very early selection for promotion to\nchief warrant officer. The 2002 vehicular homicide incident was inexplicably out of\n\n9\ncharacter and unrepresentative of his otherwise responsible behavior and lifestyle. He\nhas demonstrated sufficient rehabilitation to establish full confidence that such behavior\nis unlikely to recur, and no longer casts doubt on his reliability, trustworthiness and\njudgment. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations:\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources\nof income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Of these nine different disqualifying conditions, the Government asserted\nthat one was raised by Applicant\u2019s financial circumstances (Tr. at 111.): \u201c(c) a history of\nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nThe evidence shows that Applicant was reported to owe delinquent debts\nresulting from the Government\u2019s overpayment of his salary while he was in prison and\ndue to a medical billing error. Each debt was reported to be delinquent while he was\nactively and legitimately disputing whether he should be required to pay them. One was\nnot a valid debt and, after he paid it anyway, his money was refunded. The other\ndispute was resolved against him, and he promptly settled that debt in full. This\nrelatively brief history of not meeting two disputed financial obligations supports only\nminor, if any, security concerns under AG \u00b6 19(c).\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate financial security concerns.\nApplicant established substantial mitigation under five of those conditions:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n\n10\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\nApplicant\u2019s debt to the Government arose due to the Army\u2019s mishandling of his\npay while he was in prison, and through no fault of his own. The circumstances were\nunique, totally out of his control, and bore no reflection on his trustworthiness or\nreliability. After utilizing all legitimate and reasonable means to seek a waiver of this\nindebtedness, he paid the debt when these efforts failed. The other debt arose due to\nmedical billing errors which he took prompt steps to correct. Despite the illegitimacy of\nthe debt, he paid it pending resolution once it was sent to collections. This payment was\nlater reimbursed to him. Taken together, Applicant\u2019s actions fully mitigate the minimal\nsecurity concerns raised by his brief period of delinquent indebtedness. In fact, his\npresent solvency and \u201ccurrent\u201d status on his minimal outstanding debt shows\nremarkable financial responsibility, given his status as the sole provided for a family of\nsix who spent two of the last five years in prison.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances established by the record evidence. The\nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n  \n\n11\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of potential\nconcern involved one very minor alcohol incident 17 years ago, two debts that he\nlegitimately disputed and subsequently resolved, and his 2002 vehicular homicide\noffense. Only the latter incident provides a basis for any serious security concern. This\nincident arose when Applicant, a normally light-to-moderate drinker, became seriously\nintoxicated to the point that his BAC was .21. While he must have consciously chosen to\ndrive on that occasion, his knowledgeable participation was under, for him, the unusual\ncircumstances that his judgment was severely impaired. Although the consequences\nwere about as bad as possible, this was Applicant\u2019s only such incident in an otherwise\nhighly responsible adulthood. In the six and a half years since the incident, he\nsuccessfully completed all court-ordered sanctions and has demonstrated full\nrehabilitation and unerringly responsible behavior. There is no potential for pressure,\nexploitation, coercion, or duress, since this is a matter of public knowledge, and well-\nknown to his employer and family. Applicant\u2019s dedication to continued service in the\ninterests of  national defense through private employment, pursuit of higher education,\nremorse, and permanent behavioral changes support the conclusion that any\nrecurrence of this one-time incident of irresponsible behavior is most unlikely.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with no doubt as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility\nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has\nfully mitigated the security concerns arising from alcohol consumption, criminal conduct,\nand financial considerations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline G:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nDeleted on DC motion\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nFor Applicant\n\n12\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. This\ndetermination does not include eligibility for access to SAP, RD, or SCI. Any such\naccess would require Applicant to apply for, and be granted a meritorious waiver by the\nDOHA Director or Deputy Director under the Bond Amendment. DOHA administrative\npersonnel are directed to ensure proper annotation of these limitations in Applicant\u2019s\nJAMS file.  \n                                             \nDAVID M.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant was arrested for numerous offenses, most of which were drug or\nalcohol-related, between 1970 and 1993. She also had a minor traffic infraction in 2002.\nShe completed probation in December 1993, and she provided strong evidence of\nsuccessful rehabilitation. Security concerns were mitigated. Based upon a review of the\ncase file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is granted. \nApplicant submitted her security clearance application on May 8, 2006. On March\n18, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued Applicant a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guidelines J (Criminal\nConduct), and E (Personal Conduct). The action was taken under Executive Order\n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as\namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel\nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the\nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29,\n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September\n1, 2006. \nDecember 7, 2009\n\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on June 17, 2009. She answered the\nSOR in writing that same day (AR), and requested a hearing before an administrative\njudge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on July 14, 2009, and the case\nwas assigned to me on July 17, 2009. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on September\n8, 2009, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on September 29, 2009. The\nGovernment offered exhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were admitted without objection.\nApplicant offered exhibits (AE) A through J, which were also admitted without objection,\nand testified on her own behalf. Two other witnesses also testified for her. I granted\nApplicant\u2019s request to leave the record open until October 12, 2009, to permit\nsubmission of additional evidence. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on\nOctober 7, 2009. On October 13, 2009, Department Counsel forwarded the additional\nevidence that was timely submitted by Applicant, without objection to its consideration.\nThe evidence was marked AE K and admitted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the criminal conduct\nallegations and denied two personal conduct allegations. (AR at 1-2.) Her admissions\nare incorporated into the following findings. Applicant is a 60-year-old technician\nemployed by a defense contractor. She has worked for her present employer since\nJune 2004, and has held an interim security clearance without incident since shortly\nafter being hired. She is divorced, with three adult children. She has no prior military\nservice. (GE 1 at 6, 13-14, 18-20, 23-24, 27; Tr. at 7-9.)\nIn 1970, Applicant was arrested for possession of drugs after an undercover\npolice informant mistakenly identified her as her cousin. Applicant had used marijuana\nwith her cousin and the informant, but was not involved in possession or distribution of\nthe drug. When the mistake was discovered, charges against Applicant were dismissed.\n(GE 2 at 4; Tr. at 70-71, 74-75.)\nIn July 1977, Applicant was arrested and charged with Sale of Cocaine and\nPossession of a Controlled Substance (marijuana) with Intent to Distribute. In November\n1977, she was convicted of the second charge, and sentenced to one year in jail\n(suspended), and one year of probation. (GE 1 at 31-32; GE 2 at 4-5; GE 4 at 3; Tr. at\n75-79.)\nApplicant formerly owned and operated a seafood wholesale business. In\nNovember 1979, she traveled to another state with a large amount of cash to purchase\nsome fish for the business. She took a handgun with her for protection. The gun was\nregistered in her home state, but not in the other one as required by that state\u2019s law.\nShe left the gun under a pillow in her hotel room, where a maid found it and turned it in\nto police. The gun was confiscated, and she is not sure whether she had to pay a fine.\nHowever, she was not formally prosecuted or otherwise sentenced. (GE 2 at 5; Tr. at\n80-82.)\n\n3\nDuring August 1982, Applicant became intoxicated and got into a loud domestic\nargument with the man with whom she was then living. The police were called by a\nneighbor, and Applicant resisted their intervention and assaulted one of the responding\nofficers. She was arrested on a Drunk and Disorderly charge, and spent the night in jail\nto sleep off her inebriation. She was then released without further legal action taken\nagainst her. (AR at 2; GE 2 at 5-6; Tr. at 82.)\nOn May 27, 1986, Applicant was arrested for nine counts of Unsworn\nFalsification and Welfare Fraud. She had been receiving welfare assistance from about\n1980 to 1982 before her seafood business grew to become profitable. She wrote to the\nwelfare agency to inform them she no longer needed assistance, but nine additional\nchecks were mailed to her. During this time, she had employed a nanny to care for her\nchildren and given her access to her checking account. The nanny cashed the nine\nchecks, without Applicant\u2019s knowledge, and kept the money. Applicant was found guilty\nof fraud, and sentenced to 30 days in jail, with 28 days suspended, and had to repay\nabout $7,000 in unearned benefits. (GE 2 at 6; GE 4 at 3; Tr. at 68-70, 86-88.)\nIn 1986, Applicant and a friend went to a Carribean island where she purchased\na kilogram of cocaine for $4,000. She hid the cocaine on her person where it remained\nundetected as she reentered the U.S. through Customs. She sold the kilogram of\ncocaine to a drug dealer in her hometown for $18,000. She used the profits to support\nher children. She admitted to these events during her September 20, 2006, interview\nwith an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). They were never\ndetected by law enforcement, and she was not arrested or charged in connection with\nthem. (GE 2 at 6-7; Tr. at 88-92.)\nIn August 1987, Applicant went back to the Carribean island, with a different\nassociate, to buy another kilogram of cocaine. Customs agents searched her as she\nreentered the U.S. and found the cocaine. She was arrested and charged with\nImportation of Cocaine and Possession of Cocaine with Intent to Distribute. She\nreached an agreement with the U.S. Attorney and Drug Enforcement Administration to\nwork undercover and identify other drug dealers for them. In return, the second charge\nwas dismissed and she was sentenced to two years of confinement, followed by four\nyears of supervised probation that began in December 1989. While in prison, she saved\nthe life of another inmate who was threatened by prison gang members, and she was\nreleased early for good behavior after serving 16 months. Since her 1987 arrest and\nsubsequent imprisonment, Applicant has not illegally used or possessed any drugs. (GE\n2 at 7; GE 3; GE 4 at 4; Tr. at 88-95, 112.)\nIn late March 1993, while still serving probation, Applicant went on vacation to\nanother state. She spent the evening with some acquaintances, one of whom\npurchased some marijuana and was subsequently arrested. The police interviewed all\ngroup members, and discovered that Applicant was on Federal probation for a drug\noffense. The state authorities charged her with Promoting Detrimental Drugs, and\nnotified her probation officer. This charge was dismissed in April 1993, and Applicant\n\n4\nsuccessfully completed her probation in December 1993. (GE 2 at 8-9; GE 4 at 4; Tr. at\n92-93.)\nIn June 2002, Applicant was working on a construction project in another city and\nstaying in a hotel. She went to a restaurant for dinner and had two drinks with her meal.\nAs she drove back to her hotel in the early morning hours, she realized her hotel was on\nthe other side of the street from where she was driving in the right lane. After confirming\nthat there were no other cars in the area, she drove across the road into the left turn\nlane. A policeman then pulled her over and accused her of being intoxicated. Even\nthough she passed the field sobriety test, he still arrested her. In the process, he re-\ninjured her shoulder that she hurt earlier that week. She became angry and combative\nas a result. At the police station, she consented to and passed a blood alcohol test. She\nwas initially charged with Driving While Intoxicated (DWI) and Resisting/Interfering with\nArrest, but the former charge was reduced to a Negligent/Reckless Driving violation for\nwhich she paid a fine, and the latter charge was dismissed. (GE 2 at 7-8; GE 4 at 5; AE\nK at 2, 3; Tr. at 82-84.)\nApplicant admits and recognizes the wrongfulness of her criminal behavior from\n1970 to 1987. She resolved after leaving prison that she would turn her life around and\nbecome a good citizen. She has performed significant charitable work, is very highly\nregarded by numerous friends and coworkers, and has received regular recognition by\nher military customers for her outstanding efforts in support of their missions. She takes\ngreat pride in having overcome her difficult past and in her present contributions to the\ncommunity and her employer. Her expressions of regret for past wrongdoing and\nintention never to repeat such conduct were very credible and sincere. (AE A through K;\nTr. at 32-68, 94-99, 112-113.)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in\nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s\noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According\nto AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable\nguidelines in the context of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept.\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\n\n5\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based\non the evidence contained in the record. I have avoided drawing inferences grounded\non mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201c[t]he applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201c[a]ny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct: \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying (DCs). The two DCs supported by the SOR allegations, Applicant\u2019s\nadmissions, and undisputed evidence of record are: \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted, or convicted.\nApplicant admittedly committed multiple drug offenses from 1970 to 1987,\nincluding felonious importation of cocaine in 1986 and 1987. She unknowingly violated a\ngun registration law in 1979, and was convicted on Welfare Fraud charges in 1986 for\nwrongdoing that was primarily committed by her nanny. There is no evidence she\n\n6\ncommitted the 1993 Promoting Detrimental Drugs offense for which she was arrested,\nand that charge was dismissed before trial. Most recently, she paid a fine for a minor\ntraffic violation in June 2002. The evidence fully supports security concerns under the\nDCs set forth in AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c). \nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security\nconcerns. These are: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those\npressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life;\n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and\n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement.\nFor mitigation analysis, Applicant\u2019s SOR-listed criminal conduct and her criminal\nhistory must be evaluated as a whole, not piece by piece. Other than one minor traffic\nviolation, Applicant\u2019s most recent criminal conduct occurred in August 1987, and was\nmotivated by her desire to earn money to support her children who have long since\ngrown up. For the past 22 years, she has remained law-abiding and worked hard to\novercome her difficult past. All evidence from those who have known her recently\nattests to her present reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. She also testified\ncredibly concerning her determination that such criminal conduct will not recur. This\nevidence establishes substantial mitigation under AG \u00b6 32(a). \nApplicant made no showing that she was pressured or coerced into any of her\ncriminal acts to support application of AG \u00b6 32(b). Applicant\u2019s 1993 Promoting\nDetrimental Drugs charge and 2002 DWI charge were both dismissed, and the record\nevidence shows that she did not commit those offenses despite having been arrested\nfor them. AG \u00b6 32(c) thus provides some mitigation in relation to those two matters. \nApplicant also established substantial mitigation under AG \u00b6 32(d). Other than a\nminor traffic violation for a reckless lane change, it has been more than 22 years since\nher most recent criminal activity. She demonstrated sincere remorse for her past\nwrongdoing, and has fully complied with all court sentences resulting therefrom. After\nher 1987 arrest, she worked with law enforcement to identify and apprehend others\ninvolved in illegal drug distribution. Her lengthy and excellent employment record and\n\n7\nextensive volunteer charitable community work further demonstrate her successful\nrehabilitation. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nThe following will normally result in an unfavorable clearance action or\nadministrative termination of further processing for clearance eligibility:\n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or\ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited to\nmeeting with a security investigator for subject interview,\ncompleting security forms or releases, and cooperation with\nmedical or psychological evaluation; \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank and truthful answers to lawful\nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official\nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or\ntrustworthiness determination.\nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Department Counsel expressed the Government\u2019s position that the\nPersonal Conduct allegations in the SOR duplicate and are multiplicious with the\nallegations under the Criminal Conduct Guideline. (Tr. at 21, 100.) To the extent that the\nPersonal Conduct guideline allegations pertain to general judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness issues already addressed under Guideline J, and further analyzed under\nthe whole-person discussion below, Department Counsel is correct. To the extent her\nSOR-alleged drug involvement and criminal history may support security concerns\nunder AG \u00b6 16(e) (\u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s\nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1)\nengaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or\ncommunity standing. . .\u201d), separate Guideline E concerns may arise. Applicant\u2019s full\nacknowledgment and disclosure of her past acts, and the passage of more than 20\nyears since her last conviction, fully mitigate any such concerns under AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) (\u201c. . .\nso much time has passed. . . that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d) and 17(e) (\u201cthe individual has\ntaken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or\nduress\u201d).\n\n8\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all relevant circumstances established by the record evidence. The\nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of security\nconcern primarily involved several significant drug-related offenses, but the most recent\nof these occurred more than 22 years ago. Since her arrest for that offense, she has\ncooperated in Federal investigations as an undercover drug informant, resolved to\nchange her former criminal ways, and lived as a law-abiding and contributing member of\nher community. She was old enough to be accountable for her crimes, and fully\nacknowledges their wrongfulness. Over the past 20 years, however, she has\ndemonstrated her resolve to live a responsible life while making positive contributions to\nhelp others in need of assistance. \nThe testaments to her present good character, trustworthiness, and responsibility\nby numerous friends and coworkers are unanimous and impressive. Taken together\nwith her sincere and credible expression of remorse for former misconduct and pride in\nher new lifestyle, Applicant fully demonstrated rehabilitation and permanent behavioral\nchange. Her full disclosure of past actions and recent good behavior have alleviated any\npotential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress. The likelihood of recurrence is\nminimal.\nOverall, the record evidence generates substantial confidence concerning\nApplicant\u2019s present eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. She fully met her\nburden to mitigate the security concerns arising from her criminal conduct and personal\nconduct.\n\n9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance.

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \nCREAN, Thomas M., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP) on April 2, 2007.  On March 28, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns for \nApplicant for personal conduct and criminal conduct under Guidelines E and J.  The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  Applicant \nacknowledged receipt of the SOR on April 2, 2008. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on May 30, 2008.  He admitted one and \ndenied three allegations under Guidelines E with explanations.  He admitted seven and \ndenied three of the allegations under Guideline J with explanations.  He requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge.  Department Counsel was prepared to proceed \non October 27, 2008, and the case was assigned to me on October 28, 2008.  DOHA \n \n1 \n \n \nDecember 19, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nissued a notice of hearing on November 3, 2008, for a hearing on November 19, 2008.  \nI convened the hearing as scheduled.  The government offered six government exhibits, \nmarked (Gov. Ex.) 1 through 6.  Applicant objected to Government Exhibits 5 and 6, \nreports of personal conduct and criminal incidents, as not being relevant to his security \nworthiness since the incidents happened long ago and he has matured.  The objection \nwas overruled and all government exhibits were received and admitted to the record \n(Transcript 17-21).  Applicant submitted three Applicant Exhibits, marked (App. Ex.) A-\nC, which were received without objection.  Applicant testified on his behalf.  DOHA \nreceived the transcript of the hearing on December 2, 2008.  Based upon a review of \nthe case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified \ninformation is granted. \n \nProcedural Issues \n \n \nDepartment Counsel did not proceed with presentation of information for SOR \nallegation 1.c for lack of evidence.  SOR 1.c alleges a falsification of a Questionnaire for \nNational Security Position signed by Applicant on April 30, 1996.  The document is not \nreadable and Applicant's answers on the form cannot be determined.  Department \nCounsel also did not proceed on the criminal conduct allegation of falsification of this \nQuestionnaire in SOR 2.b.  Findings for Applicant are entered for these two allegations.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nApplicant is a 30-year-old server administrator for a defense contractor.  He \nreceived a degree in computer science in 2003 and has worked for the defense \ncontractor for approximately 18 months.  Applicant was in the Navy for three years from \nJune 1996 until August 1999 as an automatic data processor.  He was denied a security \nclearance while on active duty.  Applicant tried to learn why he was denied a clearance \nbut his request for information did not produce an investigative file.  Applicant believes \nhis clearance was denied based upon information provided by his associates in the \ncommunity and church that he is introverted and anti-social.  The reason for the denial \nis not contained Applicant's file (Tr. 42-47; App. Ex. A, NCIS Letter, dated January 3, \n2008; Gov. Ex. 1, e-QIP, dated April 2, 2007; Gov. Ex. 2, Answer to Interrogatory, dated \nJanuary7, 2008 at 4). \n \nApplicant admitted that he was charged with inappropriate sexual activity with his \nyounger siblings when he was fifteen years old.  He admitted he was placed in a youth \noffender program and received some counseling (Tr. 26-32; SOR 1.a).  Applicant \ndenied that he deliberately failed to list the charge on his enlistment papers for the Navy \n(SOR 1.b).  He also denied that he deliberately failed to list an arrest for assault and \nbattery on his April 2007 security clearance application (SOR 1.d).  Applicant also \ndenied criminal conduct arising from the falsification (SOR 2.a and 2.c).  Applicant \nadmitted to being arrested and charged with five driving offenses (SOR 2.d, 2.f, 2.h, 2.i., \nand 2.j), and two arrests and charges for assault and battery (SOR 2.e and 2.g). \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant's parents divorced and he and his younger siblings lived with his father \nfor about a year in 1992-1993, and then his mother for about a year in 1993-1994.  He \nadmitted that during this time when he was approximately fifteen years old he had \ninappropriate sexual contact with his six year old sister and younger brother a number \nof times over the period of a few months.  His mother caught him and his sister having \nthe inappropriate sexual contact and notified the police.  Applicant was placed in a \nyouth offender home and he was required to attend counseling.  His parents took him \nout of the youth offender home and program after a few months for reasons he does not \nknow.  The counseling was discontinued at the halfway house when he left the group \nhome.  He did receive counseling intermittently from the time he left the halfway house \nuntil the time he entered the Navy.  He has continued to voluntarily receive counseling \nfor social issues since then.  He considers such counseling to be more of a check and \nsounding board for him.  He has not been involved in any inappropriate sexual activity \nsince this incident (Tr. 32-34, 47-53, 53-56; Gov. Ex. 5, Applicant's Statement, dated \nDecember 13, 1996 at 3). \n \nApplicant entered active Navy duty in June 1996 after completing high school.  \nWhen he was completing his paperwork to join the Navy, he discussed the juvenile \nsexual charges with the recruiter and was advised that he did not have to include it on \nhis application since the incident was a sealed juvenile issue.  Applicant was advised by \nthe security specialist at boot camp, to include the offense on his security clearance \napplication.  Applicant completed a full statement and disclosure of his prior residences, \neducation, employment, criminal conduct, counseling, and alcohol and drug use (Tr. 35, \n56-57; Gov. Ex. 5, Statement, dated December 13, 1995). \n \nApplicant admitted he was charged with driving on a suspended operator's \nlicense on January 3, 1999 (SOR 1.j).  He was fined and paid court costs.  Applicant \nwas charged with reckless driving on August 11, 1999 (SOR 1.f).  He was fined and \npaid court costs.  Applicant was charged with driving on a suspended license on \nOctober 21, 1999 (SOR 1.i).  He was fined and paid court costs.  He was again arrested \nand charged with driving with a suspended license on November 5, 1999 (SOR 1.h).  \nHe was sentenced to a suspended jail term of ten days and fined and paid court costs \n(See Gov. Ex. 4, Court Information, dated March 25, 2008 at 1-5).   \n \nApplicant had no other driving offenses until January 21, 2007 when he was \ncharged with driving on a suspended license.  Applicant had not timely paid his vehicle \npersonal property tax.  His license was suspended by motor vehicle authorities on \nJanuary 19, 2007.  However, the notice of suspension was not mailed to Applicant until \nJanuary 23, 2007, two days after he was charged with driving on his suspended license.  \nSince he had not been notified at the time of his arrest that his license was suspended, \nthe case was dismissed (Tr. 58-59; Gov. Ex. 4, Court Information, dated March 25, \n2008, at 6). \n \nApplicant lived with and had a child with another sailor when he was in the Navy.  \nThey were on different deployment schedules.  Applicant was discharged from the Navy \nso he could care for the child (App. Ex. C, DD 214, Discharge for Parenthood, dated \n\n \n4 \n \n \nAugust 17, 1999).  The female sailor returned from a cruise with another sailor as her \nboyfriend.  Applicant and the girlfriend continued to live together for a time since neither \ncould afford to move out.  However, the situation became difficult and the female sailor \ncharged him with assault and battery to force Applicant to move.  The charges were \ndismissed (Tr. 61-64; Gov. Ex. 3, Federal Bureau of Investigation Criminal Justice \nReport; Gov. Ex. 4, Court Information, dated March 25, 2008, at 9).   \n \nApplicant was married in December 2002 to \"S\".  The marriage was difficult and \nApplicant and \"S\" fought often.  At one time, \"S\" threw an ashtray at him shattering it \nagainst the wall.  Applicant grabbed her arm to stop her from trying to hit him.  \"S\" \ntalked to a friend who informed her that she should file charges for assault against \nApplicant since he grabbed her arm.  \"S\" filed the charges.  About a week later, \"S\" \ndecided she did not want to press charges.  However, Applicant had to attend a court \nsession where the charges were not prosecuted.  Applicant and \"S\" separated in April \n2003 and their divorce was final on October 9, 2008.  Applicant did not include the \narrest and charges for assault and battery on his e-QIP because he had forgotten about \nthe offense since it was not prosecuted.  He had checked court record in one jurisdiction \nfor the above traffic and other assault and battery offense.  This assault and battery \noffense was in another jurisdiction so it did not come up on his search (Tr. 65-69; Gov. \nEx. 4, Court Information, dated March 25, 2008, at 7-8). \n \nApplicant's immediate supervisor stated that Applicant has been a true \nprofessional in all aspects of his job.  He is an integral part of their team and is one of \ntheir valuable leaders.  He has no reason to doubt Applicant's loyalty, trustworthiness, \ndependability, and judgment.  He believes Applicant should be granted a position of \ntrust (App. Ex. B, Letter, dated November 14, 2008). \n \nPolicies \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n\n \n5 \n \n \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nA security concern is raised because conduct involving questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified information.  There are two issues of Applicant's personal conduct that raise \nsecurity concerns, his inappropriate sexual actions with his younger siblings in 1993, \nand his failure to report the incident on his Navy enlistment application as well as his \nfailure to report an assault and battery on his April 2007 security clearance application.  \nOf special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers during the \nsecurity clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security clearance \nprocess. (AG \u00b6 15)  Personal conduct is always a security concern because it asks the \ncentral question does the person\u2019s past conduct justify confidence the person can be \nentrusted to properly safeguard classified information.   \n \nApplicant's inappropriate sexual contact with his young siblings that caused him \nto be charged with criminal conduct and being placed in a youth offender program \nraises Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) AG \u00b6 16 (e) (personal \nconduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, that creates a vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress, such as (1) engaging in activities which, if \nknown, may affect the person's personal, professional, or community standing . . .).  \n\n \n6 \n \n \nThis personal conduct by Applicant could affect his professional, personal, or \ncommunity standing and make him vulnerable to exploitation or manipulation. \n \n \nIn regard to the his conduct of inappropriate sexual incidents with his younger \nsiblings in 1993 when he was fifteen years old, Applicant raises Personal Conduct \nMitigating Conditions (PC MC) AG \u00b6 17(c) \"the offense is so minor, or so much time has \npassed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\"; PC MC AG \u00b6 17(d) \"the individual has \nacknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior, or taken \nother positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances, or factors that caused \nuntrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur\"; and PC MC AG \u00b6 17(e) \"the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or \neliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.\"  The incidents are \ncertainly not minor.  Inappropriate sexual conduct with his younger siblings is serious \nand grave.  At the time of the incidents, Applicant was fifteen years old and his family \nwas involved in difficult times caused by the divorce of the mother and father and the \nchildren being shuffled between the parents.  Applicant was sent to a halfway house \nand received some type of counseling.  He was withdrawn from the halfway house and \ncounseling by his parents for unknown reasons.  He and his siblings are on good terms \nwhich show the incidents did not adversely affect them.  He has continued to seek \ncounseling not necessarily for this incident but for managing everyday social issues.  \nApplicant is now 30 years old and has a child of his own.  He completed college and is \nemployed.  His supervisor notes that he is an excellent worker.  While there is no bright \nline rule as to how much time must pass and the extent of positive steps that must be \ntaken to mitigate such an offense, it is clear that a person must show reasonableness, \nprudence, and honesty in their dealings with people, and adherence to a social sense of \nduty and obligation.  Applicant over the fifteen years since the incidents with his siblings \nhas taken positive steps towards rehabilitation.   While there may be incidents of traffic \noffenses and relationship issues with a girlfriend and a spouse, he has not had any \nincidents that raise to the level of inappropriate contact with minors.  Applicant provided \nsufficient information to mitigate this personal conduct. \n \nThe security clearance system depends on the individual providing correct and \naccurate information.  If a person conceals or provides false information, the security \nclearance process cannot function properly to ensure that granting access to classified \ninformation is in the best interest of the United States Government.  Applicant\u2019s failure \nto report the above incident on his Navy enlistment papers and his failure to report a \n2003 assault and battery arrest and charge on his 2007 security clearance application \nraise security concerns under Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) AG \u00b6 \n16(a) \"the deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant and material \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history, or similar form used \nto conduct investigations, to determine security eligibility or trustworthiness\"; and PC DC \nAG \u00b6 16(b) \"deliberately providing false and misleading information concerning relevant \nfacts to an employer, investigator, security official, competent medical authority, or other \nofficial government representative\". \n\n \n7 \n \n \nApplicant twice did not provide full and complete information on documents \nsubmitted to government authorities, his Navy enlistment papers and his April 2007 \nsecurity clearance application,  In regard to these failures, Applicant raised by his \ntestimony PC MC AG \u00b6 17(a) \"the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct \nthe omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; PC \nMC AG \u00b6 17(b) \"the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by improper or in adequate advice of authorized \npersonnel or legal counsel advising or instructing the individual specifically concerning \nthe security clearance process.  Upon being made aware of the requirement to \ncooperate or provide the information, the individual cooperated fully and truthfully\"; and \nPC MC AG \u00b6 17(c) \"the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment\". \n \n \nAppellant denied intentional falsification.  Applicant informed the recruiter of the \nincident involving his siblings.  He was advised that he did not have to include the \ninformation on his enlistment papers since it was a juvenile offense and the records \nwere sealed.  When he was advised by security personnel during boot camp that the \ninstruction received from the recruiter was not correct, he provided full and complete \ninformation concerning the incident as well as other actions (See, Gov. Ex. 5, \nApplicant's Statement, dated December 13, 1996).  As for the failure to list the assault \nand battery on his April 2007 security clearance application, Applicant had forgotten \nabout the incident since it was dismissed.  He checked the court records in one district \nfor his offense and he listed the traffic offenses from that district on his application.  He \ndid not check the records of a nearby district where the assault and battery was \nadjudicated and dismissed.  While there is a security concern for an omission, \nconcealment, or falsification of a material fact in any written document or oral statement \nto the government when applying for a security clearance, every omission, \nconcealment, or inaccurate statement is not a falsification.  A falsification must be \ndeliberate and material.  It is deliberate if it is done knowingly and willfully.  Applicant did \nnot report the inappropriate sexual incident on his Navy enlistment papers because of \nimproper advice.  He did not include the assault and battery because he did not \nremember the incident since it was dismissed.  Applicant did not deliberately fail to \nreport the incidents to government official with intent to deceive.  Applicant has \nmitigated security concerns for his personal conduct.   \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness.  By its very nature it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness \nto comply with laws, rules, and regulations. (AG \u00b6 30)  The SOR alleges that Applicant \nviolated federal law by knowingly and willfully providing false information on his Navy \nenlistment papers and his April 2007 security clearance application (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001).  \nSince I have found that Applicant did not deliberately provide false information on either \n\n \n8 \n \n \ndocument, I find for Applicant on these two criminal conduct allegations concerning \nfalsification. \n \nApplicant's arrest and charges for the inappropriate sexual conduct with his \nyounger siblings, the five arrests and charges for traffic offenses, and the two arrests \nand charges for assault and battery raise Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions \n(CC DC) AG \u00b6 31 (a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses), and CD DC \nAG \u00b6 31 (c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted).  These incidents raise \nsecurity concerns even though the two assault and batteries were dismissed or not \nprosecuted, and the five other incidents are basically traffic offenses. \n \n \nAppellant has raised by his testimony Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions \n(CC MC) AG \u00b6 32(a) \"so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does \nnot cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\"; CC MC \nAG \u00b6 32(b) \"the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those \npressures are no longer present in the person's life\"; CC MC AG \u00b6 32 (c) \"evidence that \nthe person did not commit the offense\"; and CC MC AG \u00b6 32(d) \"there is evidence of \nsuccessful rehabilitation, including but not limited to the passage of time without \nrecurrence of criminal activity, remorse, or restitution, job training or higher education, \ngood employment record, or constructive community involvement.\"  As noted under the \npersonal conduct security concern, the inappropriate sexual conduct in 1993 happened \nover fifteen years ago when the circumstances of the family were unusual.  Applicant \npresented sufficient information to show he has been rehabilitated.  The two assault and \nbattery charges were based on allegations from his then girlfriend and his former wife.  \nThe circumstances of both incidents show that Applicant was involved in mutual \nassaultive conduct with his alleged victim.  The decision not to prosecute or the \ndismissal of the charges together with how the incidents happened is sufficient to \nconclude that Applicant's conduct did not amount to a criminal offense of assault and \nbattery.  The traffic incidents happened mostly in the 1999 to 2001 timeframe.  These \nincidents were minor and sufficient time has passed that they do not cast doubt on \nApplicant's reliability, trustworthiness or good judgment.  The incident in 2007 seems to \nbe more a mistake of timing since Applicant was not notified that his license was \ntemporarily suspended until after he was cited by police.  Based on all of the information \npresented as to criminal conduct, I find that Applicant has provided sufficient information \nto mitigate the criminal conduct security concerns.   \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  I considered Applicant's three years \non active duty in the Navy.  Applicant's security clearance denial while in the Navy \nappears to be a proper action based on the circumstances at the time.  However, the \ncircumstances have changed and Applicant's conduct and circumstances must be \nexamined to determine if he is now reliable, trustworthy, and displays good judgment,  I \nconsidered that Applicant completed college after the Navy and is gainfully employed by \na defense contractor.  His conduct with his siblings is serious and reprehensible.  But it \nhappened when he was a juvenile under some unusual family circumstances.  He \nreceived counseling and more than fifteen years has expired with no further incidents.  \nHe did not deliberately provide false information on documents for the government with \nintent to deceive.  The two assault and battery charges were either not prosecuted or \ndismissed and happened under the unusual circumstances of his relationship with his \ngirlfriend and his wife.  The incidents do not now adversely affect his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.  Most of the traffic offenses happened over seven \nyears ago and they also do not now reflect on his reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.  Applicant has established that these criminal and personal conduct incidents \nare unlikely to recur.  Overall, on balance the record evidence leaves me with no \nquestions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.  \nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising \nfrom his personal and criminal conduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline E:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n\n \n10 \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.i:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.j:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Murphy, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nDAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: \n \n           Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, and exhibits, eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted. \n \nOn April 26, 2006, Applicant submitted her Security Clearance Application (e-\nQIP). On November 20, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n         Applicant answered the SOR in writing on February 7, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. On March 11, 2008, DOHA assigned the case \nMay 30, 2008\n\n \n \n \n \n2\nto me. A Notice of Hearing was issued on April 9, 2008, and the case was heard on \nApril 30, 2008, as scheduled. Department Counsel offered Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5 \ninto evidence without objection. Applicant testified and offered Exhibits (AE) A through L \ninto evidence without objection. At the conclusion of the hearing, I left the record open \nuntil May 15, 2008, to give Applicant an opportunity to submit additional information. On \nMay 12, 2008, Applicant submitted an exhibit that was marked AE M and admitted into \nthe record without objection by the Government. DOHA received the hearing transcript \n(Tr.) on May 9, 2008.                                                           \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied the allegations contained in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \nand 2.a of the SOR.  \n \n \nApplicant is a 51-year old widow. She has two daughters, ages 15 and 19. In \nOctober 1975, she enlisted in the U.S. Army. In August 1978, she married her first \nhusband. She was honorably discharged in October 1978, at which time she was a \nsergeant (E-5) in the military police. While in the Army, she held a Top Secret security \nclearance. She and her first husband divorced in January 1980. (GE 1). In 1982, she \ngraduated from college with a bachelor\u2019s degree in criminal justice. In 1984, she earned \na master\u2019s degree in higher education and student affairs. After she married her second \nhusband in 1983, she remained at home most of the time to take care of her family. In \n1998, her husband died.  \n \n \nAfter her husband\u2019s death, Applicant began experiencing financial problems. He \nwas the primary source of family income and managed the family\u2019s finances. \nSubsequently, her primary source of income was social security benefits for her and her \nchildren, then ages 5 and 8, and monies she received from an inheritance. She \nadmitted that she \u201clost control\u201d of her finances after his death. (Tr. 9). In 1999, she had \nemergency surgery, resulting in additional emotional and financial burdens. (Tr. 20). \n \n \nIn 2001, Applicant started a cell phone business. The business did not work out, \nand she closed it soon thereafter. As a result of that endeavor, she incurred additional \nfinancial obligations. (Tr. 35). \n \n \n In 2003, Applicant was hospitalized for two months, at which time she did not \nhave insurance because she was unable to pay the premiums. Her financial condition \ngradually worsened, as she was unable to manage her bills for several months, and her \ndebts continued to accumulate. (Tr. 23). \n \n \nIn 2005, Applicant spoke to a bankruptcy lawyer regarding her financial \nproblems. He advised her to ignore her bills in anticipation of filing for bankruptcy, which \nshe did. (Tr. 23). Later, she decided not to engage that lawyer to represent her in a \nbankruptcy due to the amount of his legal fees, and instead asked one of her friends to \nassist her. In May 2007, she filed a Chapter 7 Petition for Bankruptcy. (Tr. 24). \nAccording to the filing, she preserved her home from a foreclosure, which decreased \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nthe amount of money initially listed in the Petition for foreclosure by about $162,000, \nand resulted in a discharge of about $65,000 in debts. Approximately one-half of that \namount related to medical bills not covered by insurance. (Tr. 72-73).   \n \n \nApplicant has essentially been unemployed since the she married her second \nhusband until April 2006, when she began a part-time position as a security officer with \nher current employer, a federal contractor. (Tr. 51). At the time she started working, she \ncompleted an e-QIP and was subsequently granted an Interim Secret clearance. \nCurrently, she has a monthly income of $900 from her employment and $2,600 in social \nsecurity benefits, giving her a total monthly income of $3,500. Her monthly expenses \nare $3,200, leaving approximately $350 a month for other expenses. (AE M). Her social \nsecurity benefits will end in December 2008. Her employer recently requested that she \nbegin full-time employment, which she would like to do. (Id., Tr. 79).   \n \n \nApplicant is very aware of her financial situation. She no longer uses credit cards \nand meets with someone to help resolve any outstanding credit issues. (Tr. 77). She \nowes the Internal Revenue Service $11,000 for outstanding taxes, which will be \nreduced to $6,000 after her 2007 tax refund of $5,000 is applied to the taxes. She does \nnot have any other delinquent bills and has attempted to stay current with her \nobligations since the bankruptcy. (Tr. 64-65).  \n \n \nSection 27 of the e-QIP inquires into one\u2019s financial record. In response to \nQuestion 27(c), Applicant disclosed that she had a lien filed against her property for an \nunpaid homeowner\u2019s association fee. In response to Question 27(d) that asks \u201cIn the \nlast 7 years, have you had any judgments against you that have not been paid,\u201d she \nanswered \u201cno.\u201d1 The SOR alleged that Applicant intentionally failed to disclose four \nunpaid judgments in the April 2006 e-QIP. She denied those allegations and stated she \ndid not attempt to deceive the Government. (Tr. 68). \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a (i) alleged that Applicant intentionally failed to disclose an April 16, \n2002 judgment. This debt arose from her failed business venture and was resolved on \nOctober 3, 2002. (AE G). \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a (ii) alleged that Applicant intentionally failed to disclose a February \n2004 judgment. This $2,960 debt was owed to a bank for a car she leased for a couple \nyears and later was repossessed when she was unable to make payments. Applicant \ndid not monitor this bill because her bankruptcy lawyer advised her to ignore all bills on \nthe basis that they would be included in the bankruptcy she contemplated filing. (Tr. 46). \nAlthough she was aware of the bill at the time she completed the e-QIP, she did not \nknow it had become a judgment and believed her lawyer was managing the matter. (Tr. \n56-58).  \n \n                                            \n1 Under Section 28: Your Financial Difficulties, Applicant disclosed that she had delinquent debts more \nthan 90 and 180 days as a result of identity theft. (GE 1). \n\n \n \n \n \n4\n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a (iii) alleged that Applicant intentionally failed to disclose an August \n2005 judgment. This $973 debt was owed to a credit union for a debt related to a \nbabysitter who used her credit card without authorization. After receiving notice of this \njudgment, Applicant telephoned the company and explained the situation.  Based on her \nconversation with the creditor, she believed the matter was resolved and did not know it \nremained on her report until recently. (Tr. 28).  \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 2.a (iv) alleged that Applicant intentionally failed to disclose an October \n2003 judgment for $413. This was not Applicant\u2019s debt and was dismissed by the court \nin December 2003.  (AE H).  \n \n \nBased on Applicant\u2019s demeanor during the hearing and the disclosure of other \nadverse information in her e-QIP, I find her explanations for not disclosing the above \njudgments credible.   \n \n \nDespite Applicant\u2019s past difficulties, she is committed to her job and managing \nher finances responsibly. Her team leader recently complimented her for conscientious \nwork and participation in a team project. (AE B). \n \n \n  \nPolicies \n \n When evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \n\n \n \n \n \n5\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG \u00b6 19(a) \u201can inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d is potentially disqualifying. \nSimilarly under AG \u00b6 19(c) \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d may raise \nsecurity concerns. Applicant accrued a significant amount of delinquent debt after her \nhusband\u2019s death in 1998, which she was unable to manage until she discharged it in \n2007 through a bankruptcy. The evidence is sufficient to raise these two potentially \ndisqualifying conditions, \n \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of those disqualifications, \nthe burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and mitigate the security concerns. \nThe guideline includes six conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \nfinancial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition may be mitigated \nwhen Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Applicant=s financial worries arose \n\n \n \n \n \n6\naround 1998 and continued into 2007. Because the problems were ongoing for various \nreasons and lasted for almost nine years, this condition cannot apply.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(b), it may be mitigating where \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), \nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.\u201d Applicant\u2019s debts began \naccumulating as a result of her husband\u2019s death in 1998, and continued for a number of \nyears, as she re-arranged her life and finances. Those circumstances were beyond her \ncontrol. She presented some evidence indicating that she attempted to manage debts \nfor a period of time before her attorney advised her to allow them to accumulate. I find \nthis potentially mitigating condition has partial application in this case.  \n \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ \nis potentially mitigating under AG \u00b6 20(c). Similarly, AG \u00b6 20(d) applies where the \nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant did not present evidence that she obtained formal \ncredit counseling; however, she is meeting with someone who will help her to resolve \nher financial issues. She submitted a copy of her budget, which demonstrates that \ndespite her limited budget, her financial obligations are under control. In May 2007, \nApplicant filed a Chapter 7 bankruptcy and discharged approximately $65,000 of debt, \nand managed to prevent a foreclosure on her residence. That action resolved many \noutstanding obligations. I conclude these mitigating conditions have some application.  \n \nNo other mitigating conditions are applicable.  \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \n            AG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nThe Government alleged in SOR \u00b6 2(a) that Applicant falsified her April 2006 e-\nQIP by failing to disclose four unpaid judgments, raising a potential disqualification \nunder AG \u00b6 16(a), which reads \u201cthe deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of \nrelevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award \nbenefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award \nfiduciary responsibilities.\u201d Applicant denied those allegations. \n\n \n \n \n \n7\nWhen a falsification allegation is controverted or denied, the government has the \nburden of proving it. Proof of an omission, standing alone, does not establish or prove \nan applicant\u2019s state of mind when the omission occurred. An administrative judge must \nconsider the record evidence as a whole to determine whether there is direct or \ncircumstantial evidence concerning an applicant\u2019s state of mind at the time the omission \noccurred. See ISCR Case No. 03-09483 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 17, 2004) (explaining \nholding in ISCR Case No. 02-23133 at 5 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2004). \n \nAt the time Applicant completed the e-QIP in April 2006, the judgment alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 2.(i) was paid and the judgment alleged in \u00b6 2.a (iv) was dismissed. Hence, she \nwas not required to disclose either one of them. Given her truthful disclosures about a \nlien under Section 27 and delinquent debts under Section 28, I find her explanations for \nfailing to disclose two unpaid judgments plausible. The omission of the information was \npossibly negligent, but not intentional. Hence, the evidence does not establish \ndeliberate falsification and this Guideline is found in her favor. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). They include the following:  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant is an intelligent, \nhardworking 51-year-old woman, who served her country for two years in military and \nheld a Top-Secret clearance. She subsequently earned two college degrees, one in \ncriminal justice and another in higher education. Unfortunately, her husband of 15 years \ndied in 1998, leaving her with two small children and insufficient funds. After his death, \nher life spiraled downward, as she attempted to manage her finances and raise her \nchildren.  Within the past two years, she began restructuring her life and appears \nmotivated to responsibly manage her finances. She credibly acknowledged her past \nfinancial problems and expressed a desire to achieve and maintain financial solvency. \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nThere is no evidence in her background to indicate that her financial problems may \ncreate a security risk. Based on her awareness of the effect that financial issues could \nhave on her employment and the steps she has taken to manage her bills, I find it is \nunlikely that similar issues will recur, especially when she obtains full-time employment \nand increases her income.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of the above \nreasons, I conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n Formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n         Paragraph 1, Guideline F:                             FOR APPLICANT \n \n                                         Subparagraph 1.a:                                    For Applicant \n \n                              Paragraph 2, Guideline E:                             FOR APPLICANT \n \n                                        Subparagraphs 2.a.(i) through (iv):            For Applicant \n  \nConclusion \n \n                       In light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Applicant \nexplained, \u201cMy brother stole my car and he went to the store and stole something, and \nthe police towed my car away, and I was out there fussing and arguing with them.\u201d Tr. \n26-27. \n \nApplicant denied being arrested or charged with any offense since January 2007. \nIn response to being asked what she would do if she found herself in another \naltercation, she said, \u201cI don\u2019t find myself \u2013 I mean, I had to learn from my mistakes and \nhow it could cost me my career, so I don\u2019t sit and argue \u2013 just like I said back in 2007, \n2005 \u2013 back in 1995, back them years, I never really had to have responsibility, \nbecause my mother was living and she helped me take care of my kids.\u201d  \n \n \nApplicant stated she sought counseling with her pastor regarding her anger \nissues in 2006. Tr. 36, 38. Applicant submitted three work-related character references \nall offering positive comments. AE A \u2013 AE C. She also submitted two recent employee \nperformance reviews reflecting above average performance. AE D, AE E.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \n\n \n \n4\n                                                          \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d2 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).3 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \n \n2 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cThis is something less \nthan the weight of the evidence, and the possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the \nevidence does not prevent [a Judge\u2019s] finding from being supported by substantial evidence.\u201d Consolo v. \nFederal Maritime Comm\u2019n, 383 U.S. 607, 620 (1966). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but \nless than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. \n1994). \n \n3 \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006).  \n \n\n \n \n5\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nConclusions \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \nThe security concern relating to the Guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 30: \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \n \nThe Government established its case under Guideline J by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and evidence presented that Applicant was involved in seven separate \ncriminal offenses spanning a 16-year period from 1993 to 2007. \n \nOf the six Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions listed under AG  \u00b6 31, two \nare applicable: \n \n(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses; and \n \n(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.  \n \nOf the five Criminal Conduct Mitigating Conditions listed under AG \u00b6 32, two are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or \nconstructive community involvement. \n \n \n\n \n \n6\n                                                          \n \nApplicant\u2019s recent arrest, which occurred after she submitted her e-QIP, brings to \nthe forefront the criminal conduct concerns raised by her past behavior. I am required to \nconsider Applicant\u2019s overall questionable behavior when evaluating the seriousness of \nthe conduct alleged in the SOR to determine factors such as the extent to which her \nbehavior is recent; the likelihood of recurrence; Applicant\u2019s explanations concerning the \ncircumstances of the incidents alleged; and her rehabilitation.4 \n \n \nUnder the totality of the circumstances, I find Applicant\u2019s criminal behavior is \nrecent and not isolated. Considering her past criminal behavior, the nature and \nseriousness of her misconduct, and her unwillingness to avoid unlawful conduct, I find \nher favorable information is not sufficient to mitigate Guideline J security concerns. Her \nbehavior raises questions about her ability and willingness to follow the law, and \nultimately, to protect classified information. Her conduct spanning a 16-year period \nrequiring repeated law enforcement intervention weighs against a finding of \nrehabilitation and positive behavioral changes. I find that none of the mitigating \nconditions apply. \n \nTo conclude, Applicant presented little or no evidence to explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate the criminal conduct security concerns. Applicant did not meet her ultimate \nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this \nconclusion, the whole person concept was given due consideration and that analysis \ndoes not support a favorable decision. \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my \u201ccareful consideration of the whole person factors\u201d5 and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant has \nnot mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I conclude she \nis not eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a. \u2013 1.g.:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 04-09959 at 3 (App. Bd. May 19, 2006). \n \n5 See ISCR Case No. 04-06242 at 2 (App. Bd. June 28, 2006).  \n\n \n \n7\nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n_________________ \nROBERT J.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleged under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, that Applicant was charged in September 2000 with domestic assault, dismissed with domestic counseling to be provided on post (SOR 1.a); that he was convicted at a general court martial in April 2001 of striking a superior officer, of assault, and of communicating a threat, and sentenced to six months confinement and a reduction in rank (SOR 1.b); and that he was charged in March 2006 for felony larceny, which was dismissed when the complainant failed to appear in court (SOR 1.c). Applicant was alleged under Guideline F, Financial Considerations, to owe eight delinquent debts totaling $53,425 (SOR 2.a-2.h). Under Guideline E, Personal Conduct, Applicant was alleged to have falsified his November 2001 e-QIP by not disclosing the April 2001 court-martial proceeding (SOR 3.a) or any delinquent debts (SOR 3.b), and to have been cited for several motor vehicle infractions between August 2001 and April 2007, including 18 times for driving while his license was suspended or revoked (SOR 3.c-3.v).

He was convicted in April 2001 at a general court martial for\nassault, but his culpability for a March 2006 misdemeanor larceny was not established.\nHe owes more than $52,000 in delinquent debt, and disclosed no past due debts on his\nsecurity clearance application. The criminal conduct, financial considerations, and\npersonal conduct concerns are not mitigated. Clearance is denied.\nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing  (e-\nQIP) on November 20, 2006. On June 5, 2009, the Defense Office of Hearings and\nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the\nsecurity concerns under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, Guideline F, Financial\nConsiderations, and Guideline E, Personal Conduct, that provided the basis for its\npreliminary decision to deny him a security clearance. The action was taken under\nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February\nJune 11, 2010\n\n2\n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial\nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended\n(Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) effective within the Department of\nDefense as of September 1, 2006.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on June 19, 2009, and requested a hearing. The\ncase was originally assigned to a DOHA administrative judge on August 3, 2009. On\nOctober 5, 2009, the case was transferred to me because Applicant was on temporary\nduty in my jurisdiction. On November 9, 2009, I scheduled a hearing for December 9,\n2009.\nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Sixteen Government exhibits (Ex. 1-16)\nwere entered into evidence, Exhibit 9 over Applicant\u2019s concerns about relevance.\nApplicant testified, as reflected in a transcript (Tr.) received on December 17, 2009.\nFindings of Fact\nThe SOR alleged under Guideline J, Criminal Conduct, that Applicant was\ncharged in September 2000 with domestic assault, dismissed with domestic counseling\nto be provided on post (SOR 1.a); that he was convicted at a general court martial in\nApril 2001 of striking a superior officer, of assault, and of communicating a threat, and\nsentenced to six months confinement and a reduction in rank (SOR 1.b); and that he was\ncharged in March 2006 for felony larceny, which was dismissed when the complainant\nfailed to appear in court (SOR 1.c). Applicant was alleged under Guideline F, Financial\nConsiderations, to owe eight delinquent debts totaling $53,425 (SOR 2.a-2.h). Under\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct, Applicant was alleged to have falsified his November\n2001 e-QIP by not disclosing the April 2001 court-martial proceeding (SOR 3.a) or any\ndelinquent debts (SOR 3.b), and to have been cited for several motor vehicle infractions\nbetween August 2001 and April 2007, including 18 times for driving while his license was\nsuspended or revoked (SOR 3.c-3.v). Applicant denied the SOR allegations with the\nexception of SOR 1.b (court-martial conviction), 3.b (omission of delinquent debts), and\n3.c (operating a motor vehicle without insurance in August 2001).\nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following\nfindings of fact.\nApplicant is a 31-year-old divorced father of two children, who works for a defense\ncontractor on tactical communications systems platforms for new military vehicles. (Tr.\n130.) He previously served on active duty in the United States military from July 1997\nuntil July 2001. In January 1999, he married a member of the military. A son was born to\nthe couple in December 1999. (Ex. 11.)\nIn September 2000, Applicant was arrested by the military police and charged\nwith domestic assault on a female (then his spouse). They argued over the keys to the\nvehicle when he wanted to leave with their son, and he called the police. She\ncomplained to the police that he had struck her in the head and pushed her to the\nground. (Tr. 46.) Applicant denies that he hit his spouse (Tr. 54.), although he was\n\nSection 20-28 of the pertinent state\u2019s general statutes provides as follows:\n1\nExcept as provided in subsection (a1) of this section, any person whose drivers license has\nbeen revoked who drives any motor vehicle upon the highways of the State while the license\nis revoked is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. Upon conviction, the person's license shall be\nrevoked for an additional period of one year for the first offense, two years for the second\noffense, and permanently for a third or subsequent offense.\nThe restoree of a revoked drivers license who operates a motor vehicle upon the highways\nof the State without maintaining financial responsibility as provided by law shall be punished\nas for driving without a license.\n(a1) Driving W ithout Reclaiming License. - A person convicted under subsection (a) shall be\npunished as if the person had been convicted of driving without a license under G.S. 20-35\nif the person demonstrates to the court that either subdivisions (1) and (2), or subdivision (3)\nof this subsection is true:\n(1) At the time of the offense, the person's license was revoked solely under G.S. 20-16.5 ;\nand\n(2) a. The offense occurred more than 45 days after the effective date of a revocation order\nissued under G.S. 20-16.5(f) and the period of revocation was 45 days as provided under\nsubdivision (3) of that subsection; or\nb. The offense occurred more than 30 days after the effective date of the revocation order\nissued under any other provision of G.S. 20-16.5 ; or\n3\ncharged in state court for domestic assault. (Ex. 1.) Pending his court appearance, he\nreceived domestic abuse counseling on base. (Tr. 54-55.) In November 2000, the charge\nwas dismissed. (Ex. 2.)\nBy December 2000, Applicant and his spouse had separated, and a military\nmediator was involved to work out custody issues. After Applicant\u2019s spouse picked up\ntheir son on a day that he was supposed to have custody of their child, military social\nwork services set up a meeting between Applicant and his spouse in December 2000. At\nthe meeting, Applicant became upset with the discussion and with the lack of support\nfrom his unit. When told that he could not leave, he reacted \u201cinappropriately.\u201d (Tr. 48-49.)\nMilitary records show he pushed his spouse into a file cabinet, struck a superior\nnoncommissioned officer who attempted to stop the assault, and threw a chair against\nthe wall, causing damage to government property. (Ex. 3.) Applicant asserts that he only\nbumped his spouse and the staff sergeant, and pushed the chair back against the wall in\nan effort to push past them to get to the door. (Tr. 49-50.) He was arrested for two\ncounts of assault and one count of damage to government property. (Ex. 3.) In April\n2001, he was sentenced in a general court martial to a reduction in rank (E-4 to E-1),\nand 180 days confinement for striking a superior noncommissioned officer, assault\nconsummated by battery, and communicating a threat (two counts). (Ex. 4.) Applicant did\nnot serve the full 180 days. He was given an honorable discharge in July 2001, and was\nrecalled to the active reserve from June 2003 to August 2004. (Ex. 11, 13, 15.)\nBetween July 2001 and June 2006, Applicant held a succession of civilian jobs in\nthe area, as a sales representative for a car dealer, as a loader at a retail distribution\ncenter, as a loss prevention officer, and then as a manager. (Ex. 11.)  Applicant was\ncited on 17 different occasions for various motor vehicle infractions or offenses, including\n16 times for driving with a revoked or suspended license  (SOR 3.d-3.s). He testified that\n1\n\n(3) At the time of the offense the person had met the requirements of G.S. 50-13.12, or G.S.\n110-142.2 and was eligible for reinstatement of the person's drivers license privilege as\nprovided therein. In addition, a person punished under this subsection shall be treated for\ndrivers license and insurance rating purposes as if the person had been convicted of driving\nwithout a license under G.S. 20-35, and the conviction report sent to the Division must\nindicate that the person is to be so treated.\nApplicant testified that he bought a sports car out of high school and received a ticket just before he\n2\nwas scheduled to deploy overseas. After he returned, he did not think about the ticket, and the state\nsuspended his license indefinitely for failure to appear in court. He was issued a driver\u2019s license in the state\nwhere he was living, and he continued to operate a vehicle on what he believed to be a valid operator\u2019s license\nuntil he had a car accident on the military installation. He learned that license was invalid because of the\nindefinite suspension in the other state, but he continued to operate a vehicle anyway because he had a job\nand had to maintain a household. (Tr. 122-23.) \n4\nit stemmed from another state suspending his right to operate a vehicle indefinitely for\nfailure to answer a speeding charge filed against him at age 18.  (Tr. 120-22.) A guilty\n2\nfinding was entered only for operating without insurance in August 2001 (SOR 3.c). The\nother charges filed by civilian authorities were dismissed, several of them after Applicant\nhad paid fines imposed by the court. (Ex.  14, 15, 16, Tr. 118.) On November 23, 2002,\nand again on June 29, 2003, Applicant was charged by military police with operating on\npost while his license was suspended. The available record does not reflect the\ndisposition of charges filed against him, which included the criminal offenses of driving\nwhile license revoked or disqualified. (Ex. 14, 15.) In March 2006, he was charged with\nmisdemeanor larceny when a female friend complained to the police that he had taken\nher cellular phone and refused to return it. (Ex. 6.) The charge was dismissed when she\nfailed to appear in court. Applicant denies that he took her cell phone. (Tr. 50-51.)\nIn June 2006, Applicant began working as a common access card operator for a\ndefense contractor on the military installation. (Ex. 11.) He was cited in August 2006, in\nSeptember 2006, and again in April 2007, for driving while his license was revoked (SOR\n3.t-3.v). As of December 2009, he still did not have a valid operator\u2019s license because he\nhad about $2,300 in fines yet to pay, having paid about $6,000 in fines plus legal fees for\nthree attorneys since 1998. (Tr. 127.)\nApplicant and his spouse were divorced in August 2006. (Ex. 11.) Applicant took\ncustody of their son. His ex-wife pursued custody through the court, and she and\nApplicant were awarded joint custody, although she became the primary custodial\nparent. Applicant and his ex-wife continue to have disputes over the custody of their son,\nbut they have not risen to the level of police involvement. (Tr. 57-59.)\nOn November 20, 2006, Applicant completed his e-QIP, from which a\nQuestionnaire for Sensitive Positions (Ex. 11) was prepared. He responded \u201cNo\u201d to\nwhether there had been any military disciplinary proceedings against him in the last\nseven years, to whether he was over 180 days delinquent on any debts in the last seven\nyears, and to whether he was currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts. (Ex. 11.)\nApplicant was aware that he had delinquent debt in his name, but he did not have the\ninformation to provide the accurate responses he knew were required. (Tr. 71-74.) He\n\nThe military police report (Ex. 3) shows that Applicant was more aggressive. He grabbed his then\n3\nspouse and threw or pushed her into a file cabinet, he struck the superior officer in the face, and he threw a\nchair against the wall and slammed a door. (Ex. 3). The confinement order indicates that he was convicted\nat a general court martial. (Ex. 4.)\n5\nhad no idea when the debts became delinquent. (Tr. 76.) Applicant sought no guidance\nor assistance in how he should answer the financial questions. (Tr. 73.)\nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on December 14, 2006, revealed several accounts\nwhere balances had been charged off or placed for collection, or both. A credit union had\ncharged off a $690 balance as of April 2006 (not alleged in SOR). In June 2001, a joint\naccount for a computer bought by his then wife in August 2000, was placed for collection\nwith a $1,443 past due balance (SOR 2.g). (Tr. 92.) Applicant also owed a $6,090\ncharged-off balance on an individual automobile loan taken out in September 1999 for\n$15,440 (SOR 2.d). The car was totaled in an accident and Applicant disputed any\nongoing responsibility for the debt. (Tr. 83-84.)  A joint automobile loan opened in May\n2000 for $13,503 was in collection with a $7,807 past due balance (SOR 2.h).\nApplicant\u2019s ex-wife kept the car, and he later learned that it had been repossessed. (Tr.\n95.) He was left owing a deficiency balance that he did not pay. (Tr. 96-97.) By January\n2005, Applicant had voluntarily surrendered a mobile home that had been damaged in a\n2002 storm. (Tr. 86.) He owed $19,996 on a $27,947 mortgage loan that he had taken\nout for the home in March 2000 (SOR 2.e). His insurance did not pay the claim, and he\nhad to choose between paying the mortgage for his damaged mobile home and the rent\non the townhouse that he and his family lived in after the storm. (Tr. 88-90.) As of\nDecember 2006, wireless telephone service debts of $328 and $144 were in collection\n(not alleged in SOR), but he took care of those debts (Tr. 104.). (Ex.  10.)\nOn January 23, 2007, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator\nabout his previously undisclosed arrest in December 2000. He indicated that his ex-wife\nhad picked up their son from daycare on a day that he was scheduled to have their son.\nAngry with her, he went to her place of duty where they argued. Reportedly in the\nprocess of getting his son and the car seat away from his spouse, he \u201caccidentally hit\u201d a\nstaff sergeant in the face. He maintained that the incident was reported to his unit\ncommander a week later, and that the investigating officer had recommended a special\ncourt martial for the offenses.  As for his failure to list the offense on his e-QIP, Applicant\n3\nmaintained that he had disclosed the court-martial information when he initially filled out\nthe form, and that he was told some days later to complete it again for some unknown\nreason. He did not have the court-martial information available so he responded\nnegatively to the question concerning any court martial or other military proceedings.\n(Ex. 13.)\nOn May 29, 2008, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator about\nthe March 2006 misdemeanor larceny charge. He explained that a female friend accused\nhim of stealing her cellular telephone after a party at his house. He denied taking the\ncellular phone, and indicated that the charge was dismissed when she failed to appear.\nApplicant explained that he had not disclosed the charge on his e-QIP because he\nthought he was not required to list dismissed charges. (Ex. 5.)\n\nW hen questioned by Department Counsel about whether he was still driving, Applicant responded,\n4\n\u201cNo. I get rides as much as I can. W e have company vehicles, I ride with them.\u201d Asked how he got to court\nfor his hearing, Applicant stated, \u201c I rode with someone.\u201d (Tr. 123.) But in response to my inquiries about the\npurchase of tires in September or October 2009 for $800, Applicant admitted he bought them for a friend\u2019s\ntruck because he primarily drove the vehicle. (Tr. 136.)\n6\nSubsequent checks of Applicant\u2019s credit on September 9, 2007 (Ex. 9.), October\n10, 2008 (Ex. 8.), and May 11, 2009 (Ex. 7.), showed little progress toward resolving his\ndelinquent debt. Instead, recent credit checks showed new past due debt in collection of\n$104 since June 2007 (SOR 2.f), $481 since December 2006 (SOR 2.b), and $504 for a\ncable box (Tr. 97.) since September 2008 (SOR 2.a). (Ex. 7, 8, 9.) As of April 2009, he\nalso owed about $17,000 in student loan debt that was in default (SOR 2.c). (Ex. 7.)\nAs of December 2009, Applicant was paying $216 per month toward his student\nloan debt. The creditor started garnishing his wages in April or May 2009 to collect the\ndebt. (Tr. 99.) He has been paying $51 or $59 per month on another student loan for the\npast year. He had been behind on his payments on that loan. Applicant is unaware of the\ncurrent balance of that student loan. (Tr. 101-02.) Applicant intends to resolve his debts,\nexcluding the student loans and the vehicle debt in SOR 2.d, through debt consolidation.\n(Tr. 94, 116.) In late summer or early fall 2009, Applicant gave a debt consolidation firm\na power of attorney to obtain financial information about his accounts. (Tr. 94.) He\nexpects that reducing the amount spent on restaurant meals and other lifestyle changes\nwill give him the $230 he needs per month to pay the debt consolidation company. (Tr.\n116.)\nApplicant\u2019s annual take-home income after tax is about $36,000. He pays $416\nper month in child support. He had been delinquent in his child support payments in the\npast but was current as of December 2009. (Tr. 106-07.) He earns enough to pay his\ncurrent bills, but has had to juggle payments on some debts when he has had\nunexpected expenditures, such as for vehicle tires. (Tr. 108.) Around September 2009,\nApplicant spent $800 for tires for a friend\u2019s truck that he was driving, even though he did\nnot have a valid operator\u2019s license. Applicant gave no reason for why he was driving\nwithout a license.  (Tr. 137.) His employer is aware that he does not have a valid license,\n4\nso he is not allowed to drive the company\u2019s vehicles. (Tr. 130-31.) Applicant pays $109\nper month for a storage unit and was two months behind in his payments as of\nDecember 2009. (Tr. 112.) Applicant opened one new checking account in the last\ncouple of years, on which he has regularly had an $800 balance to hold hotel rooms for\nwork. (Tr. 114-15.)\nApplicant has on average about $300 in his checking account. He has a savings\naccount that may have some funds on deposit one day and none the next. (Tr. 109.) He\npays $200 per month for wireless phone services (cellular phone lines for himself and his\ngirlfriend, and mobile Internet). Applicant lives with his current girlfriend and their child.\nApplicant\u2019s girlfriend does not work outside the home. (Tr. 111.)\n\n7\nPolicies\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive\nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,\nemphasizing that \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy\nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a\nsecurity clearance, the administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In\naddition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines\nlist potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be\nconsidered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of\nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the\nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair,\nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d\nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the\nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have\ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence\ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present\nevidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15,\nthe applicant is responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut,\nexplain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department\nCounsel. . . .\u201d The applicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion when seeking to\nobtain a favorable security decision.\nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government\nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to\nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk\nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified\ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation\nabout the potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information.\nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the\nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).\nAnalysis\nCriminal Conduct\nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in Guideline J, AG \u00b6 30:\n\nTitle 18, Section 1001 of the United States Code provides as follows:\n5\n(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction\nof the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States,\nknowingly and willfully - (1) falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device\na material fact; (2) makes any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or\nrepresentation; or (3) makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to\ncontain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry; shall be fined under\nthis title, imprisoned not more than 5 years or, if the offense involves international or domestic\nterrorism (as defined in section 2331), imprisoned not more than 8 years, or both. If the\nmatter relates to an offense under chapter 109A, 109B,110, or 117, or section 1591, then the\nterm of imprisonment imposed under this section shall be not more than 8 years. (b)\nSubsection (a) does not apply to a party to a judicial proceeding, or that party's counsel, for\nstatements, representations, writings or documents submitted by such party or counsel to a\njudge or magistrate in that proceeding. (c) W ith respect to any matter within the jurisdiction\nof the legislative branch, subsection (a) shall apply only to - (1) administrative matters,\nincluding a claim for payment, a matter related to the procurement of property or services,\npersonnel or employment practices, or support services, or a document required by law, rule,\nor regulation to be submitted to the Congress or any office or officer within the legislative\nbranch; or (2) any investigation or review, conducted pursuant to the authority of any\n8\nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or\nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\nConcerning the September 2000 domestic assault charge in SOR 1.a, dismissed\ncharges can be considered in evaluating an applicant\u2019s security suitability under AG \u00b6\n31(c), \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was\nformally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d Applicant does not deny a domestic\nincident over the car keys, so AG \u00b6 31(c) applies, even if I accept his claim that he did\nnot strike his spouse with his closed hand as was reflected in the police report. AG \u00b6\n31(a), \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses,\u201d applies because of the\nDecember 2000 assault of his spouse and of the military superior who attempted to stop\nthe assault (SOR 1.b). His conviction and sentence of imprisonment at a general court\nmartial in April 2001 substantiate the assaults described in the police report of the\nincident. But the more recent charge of misdemeanor larceny in March 2006 is not\ncorroborated in the available record. Applicant denies he took the cellular phone and the\ncomplainant failed to appear in court.\nWith the passage of almost nine years since the December 2000 assaults,\nApplicant would appear to satisfy mitigating condition AG \u00b6 32(a), \u201cso much time has\nelapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such unusual\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d The absence of any recurrence is\nevidence of reform under AG \u00b6 32(d), \u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation;\nincluding but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity,\nremorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement.\u201d However, I cannot fully apply either AG \u00b6 32(a) or\n\u00b6 32(d) in light of his deliberate misrepresentations on his November 2006 e-QIP (see\nGuideline E), which is felonious conduct under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001.  Furthermore, his\n5\n\ncommittee, subcommittee, commission or office of the Congress, consistent with applicable\nrules of the House or Senate. \n9\ncontinued disregard of pertinent state law by driving without a valid license is punishable\nas a misdemeanor.\nFinancial Considerations\nThe security concern for finances is set out in AG \u00b6 18:\nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nApplicant defaulted on about $17,000 in student loan debt (SOR 2.c). He stopped\npaying on the mortgage for a mobile home after it was damaged in a storm. Although the\nmobile home was repossessed, the creditor is pursuing Applicant for $19,996 of the\nmortgage balance (SOR 2.e). Applicant told the lender that he was not going to pay the\ndebt because he felt the insurance should have covered it, although he recognizes it as\na valid debt. (Tr. 91.) Similarly, he stopped paying on an automobile loan after the car\nwas totaled in an accident since the insurance company was to have sent the lender a\ncheck (SOR 2.d). The lender pursued him for a debt of $6,090 for the car, which he does\nnot intend to pay, but it remains on his credit record as a debt in collection. He failed to\npay the $1,443 balance for a computer that his then spouse purchased on his name\n(SOR 2.g). He is also being held responsible for a $504 cable television debt for a cable\nbox that was not returned (SOR 2.a), and for a $7,807 deficiency balance on a loan for a\ncar used by his ex-wife (SOR 2.h). He acknowledges that the car was in his name.\nApplicant does not recognize collection debts of $481 and $104 (SOR 2.b and 2.f) that\nare on his credit record. Excluding those two debts, his delinquent debt totaled about\n$52,840. AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca\nhistory of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.\nConcerning the potentially mitigating conditions, AG \u00b6 20(a), \u201cthe behavior\nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it\nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability,\ntrustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d cannot apply in light of the Applicant\u2019s lack of\ndemonstrated attempts to resolve the debts. The first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe\nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control\n(e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a\ndeath, divorce or separation),\u201d would be pertinent in that weather caused such damage\nto the mobile home that he and his family had to move to rental premises. But it also\nappears that after insurance would not cover the cost of repairs, he simply walked away\nfrom the property. Even if I found it was reasonable for him to do so under the\n\n10\ncircumstances, he has no valid explanation for defaulting on his student loans, or for\nfailing to timely address the computer or cable television debts.\nAG \u00b6 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors\nor otherwise resolve debts,\u201d is pertinent to the extent that he worked with one of his\nstudent loan lenders when he was behind. The majority of his student loan debt is being\nrepaid at $216 per month since about April or May 2009, but repayment in response to\ngarnishment action is not entitled to the same weight in mitigation had he contacted the\nlender and made repayment arrangements on his own. About three months before his\nhearing, he initiated contacts with a debt consolidation firm, which would qualify as a\ngood-faith effort, albeit belated, to resolve his debts. Yet, there has been no recent follow\nup on his part that would demonstrate a credible willingness to resolve his debts in the\nnear future. \nMoreover, it would be premature to apply AG \u00b6 20(c), \u201cthe person has received or\nis receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the\nproblem is being resolved or is under control.\u201d  Having paid $6,000 in fines for his driving\noffenses, with about $2,300 yet to pay, Applicant does not have funds available to put\ntoward his delinquent debts. He indicates that he should be able to reduce discretionary\nspending on restaurant meals, but he has yet to accumulate any savings.\nApplicant disputes the car debt in SOR 2.d, but it remained on his credit record as\na debt in collection as of April 2009. (Ex. 7.) He presented no documentation about the\naccident or the extent of his insurance coverage that could lead me to conclude that the\ndebt is not valid. AG \u00b6 20(e), \u201cthe individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the\nlegitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of\nactions to resolve the issue,\u201d is not satisfied. The financial concerns have not been\nsufficiently mitigated.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in Guideline E, AG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.\nApplicant did not disclose his court-martial convictions or his financial\ndelinquencies when he completed his e-QIP in November 2006. He denies any\nintentional falsification, claiming that he had listed the court martial on a previous\niteration of the form that was returned to him for corrections or additions, and that while\nhe knew he owed delinquent debt, he lacked sufficient information about the accounts to\nreport accurately about the debts. Applicant understood that he was required to be\n\n11\ntruthful and complete in his responses on the e-QIP, and that his responses could affect\nwhether or not he obtained a security clearance. (Tr. 73.) Had Applicant acted\nreasonably and in good faith, he would have responded affirmatively to the court-martial\nand financial delinquency questions, and added that he did not know the details, or in the\nalternative left blank the sections for additional detail. Furthermore, Applicant\u2019s overall\ncredibility is suspect in light of his inconsistent testimony about whether he was operating\na motor vehicle without a license. Applicant denied to Department Counsel that he was\ndriving, and he asserted that he relied on others for rides. But when questioned about his\npurchase of tires for $800 in September or October 2009, Applicant admitted he bought\nthe tires for a truck that he was driving without a valid license. AG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate\nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations,\ndetermine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security\nclearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities,\u201d applies\nbecause of his knowing, false statements on his e-QIP.\nApplicant\u2019s record of 19 separate citations for driving while his license was\nrevoked between November 2001 and April 2007 (SOR 3.d\u20133.v) reflects an ongoing\ndisrespect for the law that could have been alleged under Guideline J. Under Guideline\nE, this pattern of violations implicates AG \u00b6 16(d):\nCredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other\nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination,\nbut which, when combined with all available information supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness,\nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and\nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not\nproperly safeguard protected information. This includes but is not limited to\nconsideration of:\n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations.\nNone of the mitigating conditions apply, given the extent, seriousness, and\nrecency of the Guideline E concerns. AG \u00b6 17(a), \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-\nfaith efforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted\nwith the facts,\u201d does not mitigate his e-QIP falsifications. During his interview of January\n23, 2007, about the previously undisclosed arrest for assault in December 2000 leading\nto the general court martial, Applicant asserted that the incident occurred at his spouse\u2019s\nunit where he went to take custody of their son from her. While he may not have recalled\nthat the incident took place during a meeting set up by military social work services\npersonnel, he was not completely forthright about his misconduct on that occasion. He\nindicated that he got into a verbal argument with his spouse, took their son from her\nbecause it was his day to have custody, and in the process of attempting to get the car\nseat away from her, he accidentally hit a staff sergeant in the face with his elbow. Even\nassuming that his misconduct was less serious than it appears in the police report, I\ncannot apply AG \u00b6 17(a) where Applicant failed to candidly disclose in January 2007 that\nhe had assaulted his spouse.\n\n12\nDespite the passage of three years since his e-QIP falsifications and of two-plus\nyears since his last citation for driving while license revoked, I cannot apply either AG \u00b6\n17(c), \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so\ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d\nor AG \u00b6 17(d), \u201cthe individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to\nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors,\ncircumstances, or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate\nbehavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d Reform of the personal conduct\nconcerns is undermined by his ongoing efforts to downplay the seriousness of his past\nassaultive behavior, as evidenced by his claim at his hearing that he had \u201cbumped\u201d the\nstaff sergeant in December 2000, by his continued operation of a motor vehicle without a\nlicense, and by his false testimony when asked by Department Counsel whether he was\nstill driving.\nWhole-Person Concept\nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and\nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6\n2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant displayed poor judgment in several different aspects over the last\ndecade. While there has been no recurrence of assaultive behavior since the breakup of\nhis marriage, he concealed his conviction at a general court martial when he applied for\na security clearance. He also denied any delinquent debts when he knew his mobile\nhome had been repossessed around October 2004 for failure to pay the mortgage, and\nhe was being held responsible for a $19,996 balance. He continues to operate a motor\nvehicle despite several citations and substantial fines for driving without a license. Fines\nand attorney fees for the driving violations have placed added stress on his finances.\nWhile his defaulted student loans are now being addressed as a result of a wage\ngarnishment, and he has some stability in his family life and employment, concerns\npersist about his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness.\n\n13\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as\nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.h:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.i:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.j:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.k:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.l:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.m:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.n:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.o:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.p:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.q:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.r:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.s:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.t:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.u:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.v:\nAgainst Applicant\n\n14\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 38-year-old equipment custodian officer for a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by Applicant are incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. Never married, Applicant lived with her fianc\u00e9 for several years (between 1993 and 1998). While they were together, they shared living expenses. After they separated, she could no longer pay all of the debts she and her fiance had accumulated in her name. At the time, she was a college student and working part time at a local AFB for minimum wages. With her limited wages, she could not afford to pay her debts on her level of income (R.T., at 33-34, 37-38). Receiving no help from her finance, she made the decision to file for bankruptcy. In July 1998, Applicant petitioned for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, scheduling around $15,000.00 in unsecured debts (see R.T., at 48-49). She was discharged in November 1998 (R.T., at 33). In June 2002,Applicant purchased a 2002 Ford truck for around $24,000.00 (see ex. H). In October 2004, Applicant was involved in an accident, in which the vehicle was declared a total loss by the insurance company. Unable to continue paying on the 3 vehicle, Applicant agreed to a voluntary repossession with creditor 1.b two weeks later 9still in October 2004.

Duffy, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Per Se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nStatement of Case\nOn November 29, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Executive Order 10865 and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6\n(Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant,\nwhich detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the preliminary affirmative finding\nunder the Directive that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or\ncontinue a security clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an\nadministrative judge to determine whether clearance should be granted, continued,\ndenied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on January 17, 2008, and requested a hearing.\nThe case was assigned to me on January 28, 2008, and was scheduled for hearing on\nFebruary 21, 2008.  A hearing was held on February 21, 2008, for the purpose of\nconsidering whether it would be clearly consistent with the national interest to grant,\ncontinue, deny, or revoke Applicant\u2019s security clearance.  At hearing, the Government's\ncase consisted of four exhibits; Applicant relied on three witnesses (including herself)\nMay 29, 2008\n\n2\nand six exhibits.  The transcript (R.T.) was received on February 29, 2008.  Based upon\na review of the case file,. pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility to access\nclassified information is granted.\nProcedural Rulings and Evidentiary Issues\nBefore the close of the hearing, Appellant requested leave to supplement the\nrecord with documentation of her payment and payment agreements with her listed\ncreditors.  For good cause shown, Applicant was granted 14 days to supplement the\nrecord.  Department counsel was afforded three days to respond.  Within the time\npermitted, Applicant supplemented the record with documented payments and\nrepayment agreements with two of her creditors.  Her post-hearing exhibits were\nadmitted and considered.  \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have (a) petitioned for Chapter 7\nbankruptcy in July 1998 (discharged in November 1998) and (b) accumulated four debts\nexceeding $16,000.00.  Applicant admitted most of the allegations.  She admitted her\nChapter 7 bankruptcy, attributing the action to financial mistakes, and claiming better\nfinancial decisions.  She admitted her creditor 1.b and 1.d debts, attributing the debt to a\nvoluntary car repossession and inability to reach agreement on a repayment plan.\nApplicant also admitted her creditor 1.d debt, while claiming to have reached a\nrepayment agreement with the creditor.  Applicant denied the creditor 1.c debt,\nhowever, claiming the debt has been paid off. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 38-year-old equipment custodian officer for a defense contractor\nwho seeks a security clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted by\nApplicant are incorporated herein by reference and adopted as relevant and material\nfindings.  Additional findings follow.\nNever married, Applicant lived with her fianc\u00e9 for several years (between 1993\nand 1998).  While they were together, they shared living expenses.  After they\nseparated, she could no longer pay all of the debts she and her fiance had accumulated\nin her name.  At the time, she was a college student and working part time at a local\nAFB for minimum wages.  With her limited wages, she could not afford to pay her debts\non her level of income (R.T., at 33-34, 37-38).  Receiving no help from her finance, she\nmade the decision to file for bankruptcy. In July 1998, Applicant petitioned for Chapter 7\nbankruptcy, scheduling around $15,000.00 in unsecured debts (see R.T., at 48-49).\nShe was discharged in November 1998 (R.T., at 33).  \nIn June 2002,Applicant purchased a 2002 Ford truck for around $24,000.00 (see\nex. H).  In October 2004, Applicant was involved in an accident, in which the vehicle\nwas declared a total loss by the insurance company.  Unable to continue paying on the\n\n3\nvehicle, Applicant agreed to a voluntary repossession with creditor 1.b two weeks later\n9still in October 2004.  The lender\u2019s furnished records document that insurance\nproceeds were received from the insurance company in December 2004 for $8,200.00\n(the presumed market value of the vehicle at the time).  According to creditor 1.b\u2019s\nrecords, this left a deficiency balance owing of $14,449.61 (see ex. H).   Records also\nreflect that Applicant purchased a replacement vehicle (a 2002 Ford Taurus) in October\n2004 from another creditor for $14,076.44 (Ex. J).  Applicant retains this vehicle and\ncontinues to finance it with the same seller.  \nFollowing the hearing, Applicant documented a repayment plan she worked out\nwith creditor 1.b in January 2008.  Under her January 2008 repayment agreement with\ncreditor1.b, Applicant will make $100.00 monthly payments on a calculated $18,034.99\nbalance until the deficiency is satisfied (see ex. I).  This is designed to be a temporary\nrepayment plan until Applicant can work out a lump sum repayment of the remaining\ndeficiency balance (R.T., at 51-52).  Applicant efforts to date to reach an accord with\ncreditor 1.b on a lump sum satisfaction have been unsuccessful.\nApplicant incurred two other debts that have since become delinquent. She\nbecame indebted to creditor 1.c on a credit card account she opened in September\n1999 (see ex. 3).  Earlier efforts to pay off this and her other debts through debt\nconsolidation were not successful.  Applicant attributes her debt consolidation failure to\nher credit history which reflected her 1998 bankruptcy (R.T., at 58-59).\nMore recently, Applicant was able to work out a settlement agreement with the\ncreditor in October 2007 that enabled her to settle her account for about half of the\nowed amount:  Applicant documents payment of the agreed $708.81 account balance in\nOctober 2007 (see ex. A). She settled this debt with funds she withdrew from her 401(k)\nretirement plan (ex. A; R.T., at 54).  Her 401(k) loan will be repaid out of monthly\ndeductions from her pay check.  \nWith respect to Applicant\u2019s other incurred delinquent debt (a creditor card debt\nwith creditor 1.d for $2,031.00), records reflect that Applicant entered into a repayment\nagreement with this creditor in December 2007 (see ex. B; R.T., at 35-36).  Under the\nterms of her repayment agreement with this creditor, Applicant is obligated to make\nmonthly payments of $97.41 on an agreed debt balance of $2,337.84 (see ex. B; R.T.,\nat 56-57).  Applicant documents making her first earnest payment under this agreement\nin January 2008 (see ex. B).  \nApplicant currently nets $2,405.00 a month from her work (see ex. 2; R.T., at 61).\nHer monthly expenses total $1,350.00, and her other monthly deductions total\n$1866.00.(ex. 2; R.T., at 63).  After deducting her monthly expenses and other\ndeductions, she has a net monthly remainder of $189.86 (see ex. 2; R.T., at 62).   \nApplicant has received numerous performance awards between 2001 and 2004\nin recognition of her outstanding technical support she has provided her current\nemployer (see E; R.T., at 40-42).  Her first line supervisor tracks her outstanding\n\n4\nprogress with his company.  As an equipment custodian officer, Applicant is responsible\nfor tracking valuable government equipment (ex. D).  She is credited with carrying out\nher responsibilities in an organized, efficient, and competent manner, and according to\na high level of standards.  Her supervisor characterizes her as an honest and\ntrustworthy person (see ex. D).  Witnesses who work with Applicant and are familiar\nwith her work describe her as honest and trustworthy (R.T., at 83-89).  Applicant\u2019s\nupdated credit report shows good payment history with her current creditors (see ex. F).\n \nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\"\nif any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts and\nmeet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An\nindividual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to\ngenerate funds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income\nis also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal\nacts.\u201d  See Adjudicative Guidelines (AG), \u00b6 18.\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon\na threshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.\nBecause the Directive requires administrative judges to make a common sense\nappraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an\napplicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance\nand materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the judge may\n\n5\ndraw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the\nevidence of record.  Conversely, the judge cannot draw factual inferences that are\ngrounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfact[s] alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance. The required showing of material bearing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose of\nestablishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation, extenuation\nor mitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is a highly regarded equipment control officer for a defense contractor\nwho accumulated a number of delinquent debts over a six-year period spanning 1998\nand 2004 attributable to a number of unforeseen circumstances ranging from the loss\nof a second income following her split with her fiance and some difficult times with\nseveral of her creditors following an accident in October 2004.  Considered together,\nand without resolution, they raise  security significant concerns.\nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines where the individual applicant is so financially\noverextended as to indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, which can raise questions about the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information, and place the\nperson at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Applicant\u2019s\naccumulation of several delinquent debts and her past inability to address these debts\nwarrant the application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the Guidelines for\nfinancial considerations: DC 19(a) \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and DC\n19\u00a9) \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1998 is mostly attributable to cash\nshortages following her separation from her fiance.  With no financial support from her\nex-boyfriend to help her discharge the debts they incurred in her name, she could not\npay them all and decided to discharge them through Chapter 7 bankruptcy.\nFollowing her bankruptcy, Applicant was able to maintain her finances for\nseveral years and reestablish her good credit.  As the result of her accident in 2004,\nthe insurance company declared her financed vehicle a total loss, and dispensed a\n\n6\ncheck for only $8,200.00 on a carried balance of around $22,000.00 at the time.\nUnable to continue paying this balance and purchase a replacement vehicle (a Ford\nTaurus) to drive, she agreed to a voluntary repossession.  This repossession left her\nwith a deficiency balance of over $14,000.00 on the original purchase, minus the\nreceived insurance proceeds.  Until recently, she has not been able to pay off either\nthis deficiency balance or the other two listed debts covered by creditors 1.c and 1.d. \nSince receiving the SOR, Applicant has initiated considerable efforts to resolve\nthe debts she acknowledges as her own, and documents paying off one of her\ncreditors (creditor 1.c), and reaching repayment agreements with her two remaining\nlisted creditors 9creditors 1.b and 1.d).\nConsidering Applicant\u2019s exhibited extenuating circumstances associated with\nher sudden loss of joint income in 1998 and again in 2004 following the loss of her Ford\ntruck, and her demonstrated responsible efforts to resolve her acknowledged debts,\nApplicant may rely on MC 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem\nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation, and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d of the Guidelines for financial\nconsiderations.  Her limited financial income, while improving, precludes her from\npaying off her two remaining debts in lump sums.\nMitigation credit is also available to Applicant based on her credible proofs of\npayment and age of the debts.  Age of the debts at issue is covered by two of the\nmitigating conditions for financial considerations: MC 20(a), \u201cthe behavior happened so\nlong ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment,\u201d has applicability, while not dispositive.  MC 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated a\ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d is fully\napplicable. \n                                                   \nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.\nFinancial stability in a person cleared to access classified information is required\nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While the\nprincipal concern of a clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is\nvulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in\nfinancial cases (as here).\nBoth from a whole person assessment that a consideration of all of the facts and\ncircumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s debt accumulations, her documented steps\ntaken to resolve them, and the responsibility and trustworthiness she is credited with in\nher work and personal life, Applicant mitigates security concerns related to her proven\ndebt delinquencies.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations\ncovered by sub-paragraphs 1.a through 1.d of the SOR.\n\n7\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E2.2 factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F: (FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS):\nFOR APPLICANT\nSub-paras. 1.a through 1.d:\nFOR APPLICANT\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security clearance.\nClearance is granted.\n                                          \nRoger C.

On February 19, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nJ and E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on February 28, 2008. He answered\nthe SOR in writing and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received\nthe case assignment on April 8, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 14,\n2008, and I convened the hearing on May 7, 2008. The Government offered Exhibits\n(GE) 1-3, which were received without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf.\nHe submitted Exhibits (AE) A-F, without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the\nJune 16, 2008\n\n2\nhearing (Tr) on May 15, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, eligibility for access\nto classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated February 28, 2008, Applicant admitted the\nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.m of the SOR. He also admitted the factual allegations in\n\u00b6\u00b6 2.a 2.b of the SOR with the explanation that it was not a deliberate omission.\nApplicant provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. \nApplicant is a 49-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from .\nHigh school in 1980. After high school, he began work with his current employer. He\nhas been employed with them for 30 years. Applicant married in 1985 but his marriage\nended in divorce in 1992 (Tr. 57). He has one child as a result of that marriage. He is\nfather to another child from another relationship. He is currently single. He holds a\nsecurity clearance (GE 1).\nApplicant had a troubled marriage. He and his wife argued violently. In March\n1985, during his marriage, Applicant was arrested and charged with four counts of\nmisdemeanor assault, threats to kill, and pointing or brandishing a firearm. His wife went\nto the police department and sought an arrest warrant for Applicant. Applicant admitted\nthat the charge was filed but he believes he was innocent. He claims his attorney\nhandled the case and told him not to worry about it (Tr 24).\nOn August 10, 1986, Applicant was arrested and charged with felony larceny. He\ndoes not recall the incident but knows the charge was dismissed and his attorney\nhandled the case (T. 26). A few days later on August 18, 1986, Applicant was charged\nwith felony abduction and felony use of a firearm. He sais his wife brought the charge\nagainst him. He believed he did not appear in court. He recalls no details about the case\n(Tr. 27).\nOn July 30, 1990, Applicant was charged with misdemeanor destruction of\nprivate property, felony larceny and misdemeanor assault. The assault charge was nolle\nprossed. Applicant has no details about this except that his lawyer handled the case.\nOn June 20, 1992, Applicant was charged with misdemeanor assault. He was\nconvicted (AE A). This incident is one of the times that his wife filed charges against him\nbecause she wanted him to lose his job. According to Applicant his wife also wanted to\nget custody of their son when they divorced. Thus, she made up these charges (Tr.29).\nOn March 4, 1995, Applicant was charged with a misdemeanor obstruction of\njustice. He was convicted of misdemeanor disorderly conduct. He stated at the hearing\nthat he was guilty of this charge (Tr. 30).\n\n3\nIn 1998, Applicant was arrested twice. In August of that year he was living with\nhis girlfriend. According to Applicant she wanted him to sign the title to his car over to\nher. He did so. In September, he was charged with two counts of misdemeanor assault\nand battery. The charges were nolle prossed. Applicant stated that both incidents were\nthe result of false charges brought against him by his girlfriend. Again, he stated that his\nattorney handled the cases (Tr. 32).\nOn May 14, 1999, Applicant was charged with felony breaking and entering with\nintent to commit a felony. This charge was nolle prossed. Applicant knows that this was\nrelated to his former girlfriend but he has no other details. Again, he stated this was\ntaken care of by his attorney (Tr. 33).\nOn July 12, 1999, Applicant was charged with felony burglary and misdemeanor\nassault and battery-family member. The burglary charge was nolle prossed and the\nremaining charge was dismissed. Applicant does not remember if he appeared in court\n(Tr. 34). \nOn July 27, 1999, Applicant was charged with felony grand larceny. The charge\nwas nolle prossed. Applicant did not appear in court (Tr. 35). This incident is also\nrelated to his girlfriend who wanted her name on his car. Applicant has a new girlfriend\nbut he lives alone now.\nOn July 4, 2003, Applicant was charged with misdemeanor possession of\nmarijuana. The charge was dismissed. Applicant had a glass jar in his backyard with a\nleafy green substance in it. He pled guilty to the charge. He was given a year probation. \nOn November 9, 2006, Applicant completed his security clearance application. In\nsection 23 - police record, Applicant listed his pending charge for the possession of\nmarijuana. He did not list the above referenced felony convictions or charges. Applicant\nclaimed he did not know that he had a criminal record. He believed because they were\ndismissed or nolle prossed that they were not on his record. He also stated that he had\nforgotten about the charges from his marriage. He took leave from work went to the\ncourt recently to find his records. He now understands what charges and convictions he\nhas on the FBI record. He explained that because his wife had filed so many complaints\nand the fact that his lawyer took care of everything, he had no records or real memory\nof all the 1980 and 1990 incidents.  \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n4\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in\nAG & 30, \u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d\n\n5\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 31(a), an Asingle serious crime or multiple lesser offenses@ may be potentially\ndisqualifying.  Similarly under AG & 31(b), A allegations or probation@ may raise security\nconcerns. As noted above, Applicant was arrested and charged with a number of\nincidents over a span of 20  years. He has two misdemeanor convictions for assault and\ndisorderly conduct. These facts are sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying\nconditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from criminal conduct. Under AG \u00b6 32(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Aso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.@ Applicant=s criminal conduct occurred over a span of more than 20 years.\nHis last charge was in 2003. However, most of the charges were dismissed. His last\nconviction was in March 1995. The repeated incidents do create some doubt about\nApplicant\u2019s judgment. This potentially mitigating condition is not a factor for\nconsideration in this case. \nUnder AG & 30(d), it may be mitigating where A there is evidence of successful\nrehabilitation; including, but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of\ncriminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good\nemployment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d As noted above, Applicant\nhas been employed since 1980 with his employer. He has no recorded disciplinary\nactions. He has held a security clearance for more than 20 years. He has not had any\nincidents in five years. I find this potentially mitigating condition applys in this case. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate with\nthe security clearance process.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 16(a):\ndeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or\nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment\n\n6\nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine security eligibility or\ntrustworthiness or award fiduciary responsibilities.\nSimilarly, under AG \u00b6 16(d):\ncredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other\nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but\nwhich, when combined with all available information supports a whole-person\nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of\ncandor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard protected\ninformation. This includes but is not limited to consideration of: (1) untrustworthy\nor unreliable behavior....\nApplicant was credible in his testimony that he did not understand that all the\ncharges that were dismissed over the years were on a criminal record. He had an\nattorney take care of the many complaint charges and arrest warrants from his first\nmarriage. Many times he did not appear in court. In addition, Applicant testified that his\npresent girlfriend filled out the security form for him because he needed help with the\ncompletion. I do not find that Applicant intentionally falsified his SF 86 security\nclearance application.  \nAG \u00b6 16(e) \u201cpersonal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s\nconduct that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation or duress, such as (1)\nengaging in activities which, if known, may affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, or\ncommunity standing.\u201d This disqualifying condition is not a factor for consideration\nbecause Applicant revealed the incidents during his investigation in 2007.\nParagraph 17 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Specifically,\nAG \u00b6 17(c) \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so\ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not case doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgement\u201d is a factor for consideration in this case. Moreover, AG \u00b617(d) \u201cthe individual\nhas acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to change the behavior or\ntaken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, circumstances or factors that\ncaused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is\nunlikely to recur\u201d does apply. Thus, AG 17(e) \u201cthe individual has taken positive steps to\nreduce or eliminate vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress\u201d is a factor for\nconsideration. He has mitigated any personal conduct concerns through his recent\nactions and behavior. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\n\n7\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is a hard working man. He\nhas been employed since 1980 with his current employer. He has no recorded\ndisciplinary actions. He is a loyal employee. He has held a security clearance during the\nterm of his employment (almost 30 years) with no difficulties.\nThe numerous criminal charges listed over the years were either dismissed or\nnolle prossed. Applicant does have two misdemeanor convictions but the last one was\nin 1995. Applicant listed a 2003 pending charge for possession of marijuana. That\ncharge was also dismissed.\n \nOverall, the record evidence and whole person analysis leaves me without\nquestions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.\nFor all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising\nfrom his personal conduct and criminal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a-m:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a-b:\nFor Applicant\n\n8\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

After a thorough review of the record, pleadings, \nexhibits, and testimony, I make the following additional findings of fact: \n \n \nApplicant is a 57-year-old technical support specialist who has worked for a \ndefense contractor since June 2006, and is seeking to obtain a security clearance. (Ex. \n1, Tr. 31-32) Applicant\u2019s co-workers state Applicant performs his tasks quickly and \nefficiently, is motivated by professionalism, pleasant to work with, and has a good \nattitude. \n \n \nIn 1985, Applicant joined a company and was a manager. (Tr. 35) The company \nwas selling ruggedized computer peripherals. (Tr. 32) The company was an electronics \nrepair facility that did no manufacturing, but did quality control. (Tr. 55, 57) The number \nof company employees varied between 25 and 50. (Tr. 34) Applicant received straight \nsalary for doing his job. Compensation for some company employees depended upon \nthe income generated by the contracts. Applicant\u2019s salary was independent of what the \ncompany received in compensation. Applicant\u2019s job was to prepare cost estimates and \nsubmit those estimates to his boss, who would in turn submit estimates to the \nGovernment for payment. (Tr. 63) Applicant testified he did not know how his supervisor \nused the estimates. He never saw the cost estimates the company submitted to the \nGovernment.  \n \n1 Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines \n(AG). \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThe two owners of the company had a falling out and one alleged the other was \nmisrepresenting the pricing for two repair contracts. (Tr. 33) In 1989, Applicant, the \ncompany he worked for, and other employees were investigated by the U.S. Naval \nCriminal Investigative Service for false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims related to alleged \novercharges on a labor contract.  The investigation was still in progress when Applicant \nleft the company in 1994. (Tr. 34) In 1994, the company decided its west coast office \nwas no longer necessary and closed the plant where Applicant worked (Tr. 35)  \n \n \nNo criminal or civil action resulted from the investigation. (Ex. 2) The civil \nAssistant United States Attorney found there was sufficient evidence to support civil \nprosecution for the company making false claims, but the estimated loss was below the \ncivil division\u2019s threshold. (Ex. 2, page 67-68, Tr. 62) Applicant was never fired or \ndisciplined as a result of the investigation. (Tr. 35, 64) The final report was made in \n1999. (Tr. 59)  \n \n \nIn 1996, Applicant\u2019s company transferred him to another state. His ex-wife, an \ninsurance underwriter, did not move to the new state. (Tr. 36) Every month Applicant \nsent his then-wife $1,500 to $2,000 to assist in paying for their home in California. Even \nthough separated from his then-wife and living in another state, it was Applicant\u2019s goal \nupon retiring to return to California and reconcile with his then-wife. (Ex. 6) Applicant \nlater learned his ex-wife stopped paying the mortgage in 2005. (Tr. 41) She has never \naccounted for the monthly money Applicant sent her. (Tr. 41) Applicant acknowledged \nhe should have been more diligent in determining how his ex-wife was spending the \nmoney he sent her. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s ex-wife also owed some property in Arizona, which Applicant did not \nknow about until the investigation into his financial delinquencies began. (Tr. 38) At a \ndate not disclosed in the record, Applicant\u2019s ex-wife started business as a warehouse \ndistributor and delivering pet food door-to-door, which eventually went out of business. \n(Ex. 6, Tr. 41) When interviewed, Applicant was routinely working 16 hours per week \novertime and his monthly gross income was approximately $7,000. At that time, \nApplicant and his then-wife\u2019s monthly net income was $9,515. (Ex. 6) Applicant\u2019s \nincome after expenses and debt payment was $3,295. (Ex. 6)  \n \n \nIn August 2003, Applicant\u2019s ex-wife filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection. In \nJune 2004, the bankruptcy was converted to a Chapter 7 and her debts were \ndischarged. Schedule F of the bankruptcy listed $124,400 in obligations to creditors \nholding unsecured nonpriority claims. In May 2005, Applicant\u2019s ex-wife was required to \nrefinance the property and pay $65,000 from the equity to satisfy the creditors in her \nbankruptcy. (Ex. E) Because the property was transferred without the consent of the \nbankruptcy trustee, the trustee filed suit. In May 2008, Applicant\u2019s ex-wife\u2019s bankruptcy \ncase was dismissed. (Exs. 11, 12) At a date not disclosed in the record, the title insurer \npaid the trustee $115,000 to settle the matter and the $65,000 obligation was met. (Ex. \nH) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nApplicant believed he and his then-wife had $325,000 equity in their California \nhome. He wanted to refinance his loan. In January 2007, Applicant stated that he and \nhis then-wife planned on entering into a buy-back program for his home. An investor \nwas to purchase the home at fair market value, pay off the mortgages, rent the home to \nhis then-wife for a year, and then give them the opportunity to buy it back. (Tr. 6) Any \nequity received from the arrangement was to be used to pay outstanding debts. (Tr. 6) \nThe finance company and the mortgage company attempted to scam the Applicant and \nhis ex-wife. Once the papers were signed the company sold it to another bank. It was \nthat bank which discovered the trustee had not been paid. (Tr. 39)  \n \n \nApplicant asserts his ex-wife forged his name to the title transfer. (Tr. 44) \nApplicant and his ex-wife have signed quit claim deeds to the home. (Ex, H) They \nsurrendered their interest, the bank paid the mortgage, and they will receive no equity \nfrom the sale of the home they owned since 1990. (Tr. 40)  \n \n \nIn April 2009, Applicant filed suit against his ex-wife and other defendants. In \nMay 2009, Applicant filed for divorce from his wife of 14 years. In September 2009, \nApplicant filed a separate action against the notary and surety company for allegedly \nillegally claiming to have notarized his signature on a grant deed of the property. (Ex. 6) \nThe suits have been settled. (Ex. H) Applicant was paid $5,000 by the title insurance \ncompany and $15,000 by the surety company. (Ex. H)  \n \n \n \nIn February 2006, a company filed suit to collect money owed. (Ex. 4) The record \nis silent as to whether this was filed against Applicant, his ex-wife, or against them \njointly. In September 2006, a $12,419 default judgment (SOR \u00b6 1.a) was entered. (Ex. \n4) This judgment was paid from the proceeds of the sale of the California property. (Ex. \nB, F, G, Tr. 48)  \n \n \nIn January 2007, Applicant was interviewed concerning his financial \ndelinquencies. (Ex. 6) There were 37 bad debts. (Tr. 44) When called for the interview, \nApplicant was unaware of any bad debts. He contacted his ex-wife and learned there \nwere bad debts and she had filed for bankruptcy protection in 2004. He was previously \nunaware of the bankruptcy and the delinquent debts. His ex-wife indicated the debts \nwere discharged.  \n \n \nIn November 2007, Applicant answered written interrogatories concerning his \nfinancial delinquencies. With his answer, he enclosed a letter from his ex-wife\u2019s \nattorney, which stated his ex-wife\u2019s chapter 13 bankruptcy had been converted to a \nChapter 7 bankruptcy. In June 2004, his ex-wife was discharged in bankruptcy. \nApplicant did not join in the bankruptcy. However, under California law, Applicant\u2019s joint \ncreditors may not collect from the couple\u2019s community property. Applicant and his ex-\nwife had been married since 1985 and had no separate property.  \n \n \nA summary of the SOR debts and their current status follows: \n \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nCreditor \nAmount  \nCurrent Status \na \nJudgement.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which must be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n\n \n6 \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \n \nRevised Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 18 articulates the security concerns \nrelating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nAdditionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect \nof life provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n\n \n7 \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with his creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts as agreed. Absent \nsubstantial evidence of extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an applicant with a \nhistory of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk that is \ninconsistent with holding a security clearance. An applicant is not required to be debt \nfree, but is required to manage his finances so as to meet his financial obligations. \n \n \nIn January 2007, Applicant was interviewed concerning his financial \ndelinquencies. At that time, there were 37 bad debts, of which Applicant was not \nunaware. While married, Applicant\u2019s ex-wife incurred three judgments and numerous \naccounts placed for collection. The SOR lists three judgments and five accounts placed \nfor collection totaling approximately $42,000. The record evidence supports a \nconclusion Applicant has a history of financial problems. Disqualifying Conditions AG \u00b6 \n19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20 are \npotentially applicable: \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 20(a), the debts remained unpaid until recently. In 1996, Applicant \nwas transferred to another state. He was sending his then-wife $1,500 to $2,000 to \nassist in paying the mortgage. He was unaware she was failing to pay their mortgage \nand other expenses. She stopped making mortgage payments in 2005. Additionally, she \nopened accounts without his knowledge. Applicant was unaware not only the family\u2019s \n\n \n8 \n \nfinancial obligations were not being met, he was also unaware his ex-wife had filed for \nbankruptcy protection, and failed to make sure the bankruptcy trustee properly received \nthe funds from the sale of their home. In 2009, Applicant and his wife divorced. It is \nunlikely Applicant will again incur financial problems due to his ex-wife\u2019s improper \nactions.  \n \nUnder AG & 20(b), Applicant experienced both separation and divorce along with \nthe financial burden associated with each. Applicant\u2019s ex-wife had a business that \nfailed. AG & 20(b) applies. \n \nUnder AG & 20(c) there is a clear indication Applicant\u2019s financial problems are no \nlonger a problem. In 2009, he divorced his wife and in 2010, received $20,000 from the \ntitle company and surety company to settle claims he had against them. AG & 20(c) \napplies. \n \n \nThe three judgments and five collection accounts listed in the SOR have been \npaid, which represents a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts. AG & 20(d) applies. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 explains why personal conduct is a security concern stating: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nWhen Applicant completed his June 2006 e-QIP, his answers related to debts \nbeing more than 180 days delinquent were incorrect, but this does not prove Applicant \ndeliberately failed to disclose information about his finances. Applicant denied any \nintentional falsification. Deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of a material \nfact in any written document or oral statement to the Government, when applying for a \nsecurity clearance, is a security concern. But every inaccurate statement is not a \nfalsification. A falsification must be deliberate and material. It is deliberate if it is done \nknowingly and willfully.  \n \nWhen Applicant completed his e-QIP, he was unaware he had any delinquent \ndebts. He lived in a separate state from his then-wife. He was sending home $1500 to \n$2,000 per month assuming his ex-wife was using the money to pay their obligations. \nHis assumption was faulty. At the time the e-QIP was completed, his ex-wife had \nstopped paying the mortgage for a year and was delinquent on numerous accounts. \nHowever, Applicant was unaware of her failure to pay the mortgage, her failure to pay \ntheir other obligations, and her seeking bankruptcy protection. When he completed his \n\n \n9 \n \ne-QIP, he believed all his debts were in good standing. Having observed Applicant\u2019s \ndemeanor and listened to his testimony, I find his answers were not deliberate \nomissions, concealments, or falsifications. I find for Applicant as to SOR \u00b6 2.a. \n \n \nBetween 1985 and 1994, Applicant worked for a company that was investigated \nby the U.S. Naval Criminal Investigative Service for false, fictitious, or fraudulent claims \nrelated to alleged overcharges on a labor contract. The two owners of the company had \na disagreement and one alleged the other was misrepresenting the pricing on repair \ncontracts submitted to the Government. Applicant, a manager for the company, \nsubmitted cost estimates to his boss. He never saw what his boss submitted to the \nGovernment. Applicant received a straight salary for doing his job and had no incentive \nto submit false or inflated cost estimates.  \n \n \nThe investigation was still progressing when the plant closed and Applicant \nmoved to a new job. Applicant was never fired or disciplined as a result of the \ninvestigation. In 1999, five years after Applicant had left the job, the investigation \nclosed. No criminal or civil action resulted from the investigation. Applicant has denied \nany wrongdoing. The record fails to support any inappropriate action by Applicant. I find \nfor Applicant as to SOR \u00b6 2.b. \n \nWhole-Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. All of the debts listed in the SOR \nhave been paid. Of course, the issue is not simply whether all his debts are paid\u2014it is \nwhether his financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security \nclearance. (See AG & 2(a)(1))  \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nApplicant and his ex-wife separated 14 years ago when Applicant\u2019s job \ntransferred him to another state. Although separated, it was Applicant\u2019s hope to one day \nmove back and resume his life with his then-wife. Applicant was routinely working 16 \nhours per week overtime and his monthly gross income was approximately $7,000. He \nand his then-wife\u2019s monthly net income was almost $10,000 per month. Applicant was \nsending her $1,500 to $2,000 each month. She was not paying the bills nor was she \npaying the mortgage. His ex-wife never told him what she did with the money and he \nacknowledges he should have paid more attention to what she was doing with their \nfinances. \n \n \nIn 2006, when he completed his e-QIP, he was unaware of any financial \nproblems. Applicant assumed he and his ex-wife had $325,000 equity in their home \nwhen there was no equity. His ex-wife had stopped making mortgage payments in \n2005. Applicant sued a number of companies and individuals for inappropriate conduct \nand settled the matter for $20,000. It was his ex-wife\u2019s conduct and not his which lead to \nthe financial problems. Now that he is divorced, the chances of his ex-wife causing him \nfurther financial problems are remote.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the financial and personal conduct security concerns.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Financial Considerations: FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a\u20141.h: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct:   \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a\u20142.b: \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.  \n \n \n_______________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n",

The case was assigned to me on January 15, 2008. DOHA issued\na notice of hearing on January 20, 2008 scheduling it for March 4, 2008. The case was\nthen rescheduled for March 6, 2008. During the hearing, I received three government\nexhibits, 30 Applicant exhibits, and the testimony of three Applicant witnesses. DOHA\nreceived the transcript on March 20, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file,\nApril 17, 2008\n\n2\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ngranted.\nPreliminary Ruling\nSOR subparagraph 1.b, \u201cYou are indebted to various medical providers on\napproximately 25 accounts in the approximate total amount of $6,208 for debts placed\nin collection,\u201d is vague and overbroad. Although SORs are not criminal indictments, and\ndo not need to be drafted with a high level of specificity, they must, at a minimum, be\ndrafted with enough specificity to enable applicants to prepare a response. SOR\nsubparagraph 1.b fails to meet this minimum threshold, therefore, l have resolved it in\nApplicant\u2019s favor.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. He is a 49-year-old married man\nwith three children ages 19, 17, and 11. He has a high school diploma and has taken\nsome college courses. He is a systems administrator who is responsible for, among\nother things, managing the access list to secured and controlled areas at his jobsite.\nThrough the 11 years he has held this position, his employers have changed, but his\nresponsibilities have remained the same.\nAccording to Applicant\u2019s supervisor, he is an outstanding employee who \u201chas\ncontributed significantly to the quality and scope\u201d of the services the company provides\non the contract (Exhibit Q). He is active in the community, often coordinating church-\nrelated programs (Exhibit S).\nApplicant has been struggling to make ends meet since the birth of his first child,\nwho was born asthmatic in 1988. Later, a life-threatening bout of whooping cough,\nprompted Applicant\u2019s wife to quit her job to care for him (Tr. 25). Shortly after\nApplicant\u2019s wife quit her job, he was laid off from his job. Although he quickly found\nanother job, it paid half the salary of the previous job (Tr. 26). \nApplicant\u2019s second child was born prematurely with \u201ca high-line membrane\ndisorder which made his lungs weak.\u201d Because of the severity of this condition, illnesses\nthat were typically routine for healthy children required hospitalization for Applicant\u2019s son\nthroughout his infancy (Tr. 48). In addition to the frequent hospitalizations, he went to\nthe doctor approximately twice per month through pre-adolescence (Tr. 49).\nApplicant\u2019s third child was also born with asthma requiring frequent doctor visits.\nAs the children grew, their health gradually improved. Applicant and his wife then began\nhaving serious health problems. Between 1999 and 2003, Applicant underwent ankle\nsurgery and emergency hernia surgery (Tr. 54), while his wife underwent a\nhysterectomy (Tr. 53), and surgery to remove a suspicious lump from her breast\n(Answer). \n\n3\nAlthough Applicant has had health insurance for most of his career, his providers\nchanged as his employers changed, and the scope of coverage varied drastically, with\ncosts ranging from eighty to four hundred dollars monthly. Applicant gradually lost track\nof his healthcare expenses and they began to grow delinquent.\nBy June 2007, Applicant had accrued approximately $7,000 of delinquent debt.\nThe non-medical debt included a judgment (SOR subparagraph 1.a), a video store\ndelinquency (SOR subparagraph 1.f), and the deficiency remaining from the 2004\nvoluntary repossession of an automobile (SOR subparagraph 1.g).\nThe judgment occurred after a former landlord sued him in 2004 for\napproximately $5,000, alleging damages to the rental property. The landlord was\nawarded $1,354 (Tr. 43). The landlord moved shortly after obtaining the judgement, and\nApplicant has been unable to locate him. Approximately five months ago, he went to the\ncourt that entered the judgment in order to locate him, but was unsuccessful. The\njudgment remains outstanding.\nThe video store delinquency totaled $139. Applicant satisfied it (Exhibit E, Tr.\n59). There is no record evidence of the date he satisfied it.\nApplicant chose to return the automobile listed in SOR subparagraph 1.g to the\ndealer because he could not afford maintenance payments. The deficiency remaining\nfrom the voluntary repossession was $4,689. He satisfied it in September 2007 (Exhibit\n2 at 8, Exhibits F-G).\nSOR subparagraph 1.c alleges approximately six delinquent medical accounts. In\nOctober 2007, Applicant contacted the collection agency, and discovered he actually\nowed debts on 15 accounts. He then developed a payment plan, and provided the\ncollection agent a copy. Applicant owes approximately $2,300. Since November 2007,\nhe has been making approximately two payments per month consistent with the plan. \nSOR subparagraph 1.d, a $109 medical bill, is a duplicate of SOR\nsubparagraphs 1.j and 1.l (Exhibit BB). Applicant satisfied it (Exhibit DD).\nApplicant owes the collection agency listed in SOR subparagraph 1.e\napproximately $349 on four accounts. He contacted the collection agency  in October\n2007, and organized a payment plan whereupon he will pay approximately $30 each\nmonth until the delinquency is satisfied (Exhibit C). He has been making payments\nsince November 2007. The collection agent will provide a receipt in September 2008\nwhen the delinquency is completely satisfied (Tr. 59). \nApplicant contacted the collection agent listed in SOR subparagraph 1.h in\nOctober 25, 2007, and confirmed there were 11 delinquent accounts, instead of four as\nalleged. He then arranged a payment plan. By the date of the hearing, he had satisfied\nthree of the accounts (Exhibit BB).\n\n4\nApplicant satisfied the delinquency listed in SOR subparagraph 1.i (Exhibit J). He\ncontacted the collection agency listed in SOR subparagraph 1.k, and discovered he\nowed money on 10 accounts rather than two, as alleged. There is no record evidence of\nthe amount of the revised delinquent total. (Exhibit L). He has completely satisfied four\naccounts, and made payments on two others (Exhibit BB).\nApplicant contacted the collection agency listed in SOR subparagraph 1.m, and\ndiscovered he owed on 13 accounts rather than nine as alleged. He arranged a\npayment plan, and has been making approximately bi-monthly payments since\nNovember 2007 (Exhibit N). \nShortly after writing each creditor, Applicant met with a credit counselor who\nhelped him complete \u201ca comprehensive Financial Needs Analysis,\u201d and helped him\ndevelop the above-referenced payment plans (Exhibit T, Tr. 28). He meets with him\nperiodically to ensure that he stays on track.\nApplicant budgets his finances (Exhibit 2 at 12). In November 2007, he received\na raise. His monthly income is now $1,500 per month higher than it was when he first\nbegan developing payment plans in October 2007 (Tr. 68). His wife recently obtained a\nnew job with insurance benefits. Now, Applicant only includes himself and his children\non his policy. This will save him $200 each month (Tr. 70). The delinquencies will be\ncompletely satisfied by December 2010 (Exhibit N at 2).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a\nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security. Under Directive \u00b6\nE3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged\nin the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is responsible for presenting\n\u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by\napplicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The Applicant has the ultimate burden\nof persuasion for obtaining a favorable security decision. \n\n5\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information\u201d (AG\n\u00b6 18). Moreover, \u201can individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to\nengage in illegal acts to generate funds\u201d (Id.). Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems\ntriggers the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d 19(c),\n\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d and 19(e), \u201cconsistent spending beyond\none\u2019s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative\ncash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.\u201d \nHis delinquencies were not caused by extravagant or irresponsible spending.\nInstead, they were caused by difficulties managing excessive medical expenses\nincurred by his family over a 15-year period. Since September 2007, he has been\nsatisfying them in a methodical, organized manner. He meets periodically with his credit\ncounselor, and his income has increased by $1,500 per month since he began\nexecuting a payment plan, while his monthly expenses have decreased by $200 per\nmonth. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual\nacted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d 20(c) \u201cthe person has received or is\nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem\nis being resolved or is under control,\u201d and 20(d) \u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith\neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts,\u201d apply.\nAlthough Applicant provided comprehensive evidence documenting his contacts\nwith creditors and outlining his payment plans, he did not provide receipts documenting\nall of his payments. He did, however, provide such evidence supporting his satisfaction\nof the largest delinquency, the car deficiency. Also, his testimony was credible. Having\nevaluated the cause of his delinquencies, his efforts at eliminating them, and his current\nfinancial stability, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the financial considerations\nsecurity concern.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances.

On March 27, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued\na Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline F for\nApplicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified\nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense\nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program\n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the\ncase assignment on May 20, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on May 30, 2008,\nand I convened the hearing as scheduled on June 19, 2008. The government offered\nExhibits (GE) 1 through 7 which were received without objection. Applicant testified on\nJuly 25, 2008\n\n2\nher own behalf. She also submitted Exhibits (AE) A through K. Department Counsel had\nno objection to the exhibits. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr) on June\n27, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony,\neligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn her Answer to the SOR, dated April 14, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6 1.a of the SOR.  Applicant provided additional information to support her\nrequest for eligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor. Applicant graduated\nfrom college in 1977 (AE ) and received a Master\u2019s degree in 1980. Applicant completed\nher Ph.D. in July 2007 (AE K). Applicant has been employed in her current position\nsince 2003 (GE 2 ).\nApplicant married in 1980. That marriage ended in divorce in February 2007. She\nhas two grown children from that marriage (GE 1). She served in the U.S. Army from\n1977 until 1988. \nApplicant\u2019s first husband retired from the Army in 1992. After he retired, he did\nnot find steady employment. He had various offers but he did not believe that they were\nsuitable for him. He is a finishing carpenter but decided not to use those skills to find a\njob. Eventually, he stopped looking for any permanent employment (Tr. 16). Applicant\u2019s\nhusband did some short term projects for a period of time. Applicant was basically the\nsole provider for the family. \nApplicant and her husband received marital counseling. The marital problems\nstemmed from Applicant\u2019s husband\u2019s financial irresponsibility and his careless attitude.\nHe was also verbally abusive to Applicant and the children. She wanted to remain in the\nmarriage for the sake of her children. Applicant at one time had three part-time positions\nin addition to her graduate course work. Applicant\u2019s husband was diagnosed with\ncancer in 1998. He was given one to five years to live. It was about that time in 1999\nthat Applicant planned to separate from her husband. However, due to his illness and\ntreatments, she felt obligated to stay in the marriage (Tr. 19). Her husband survived the\ncancer and is still living.\nApplicant could not find employment after she left the service in 1988. She was\nunemployed for a time in 1989-1990. She was basically self-employed from 1992 until\n2003 (Tr. 36) During this time her husband was taking care of the financial affairs and\nadministrative details. Although Applicant was quite capable of dealing with the financial\nmatters, she was distracted due to the tension in the marriage and the many hours she\nwas working, caring for her children and going to school. Neither Applicant nor her\nhusband worked as an employee. Thus, they were required to file estimated taxes as\nsmall business/ self-employed. Some years the federal taxes were filed and other years\nthey were not. They hired a CPA to help them in 2004. Applicant believed that the CPA\n\n3\nwas working with her husband and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to resolve any\ntax issues. In April 2006, the IRS filed a lien against Applicant and her husband for the\ntax years 1996, 1997, 1999 and 2002. Applicant paid all her bills and accounts while in\nthe marriage. The credit report confirms that she always paid as agreed on her\naccounts (GE 3). She could not pay all the tax due until the marital home would be sold.\nApplicant and her first husband finally divorced in February 2007 (AE A).\nApplicant\u2019s husband agreed to vacate the family home, but when he refused to leave, a\ncontempt order was imposed (Tr 27). Applicant was then able to sell the home property\n(AE C) on the 29  of May 2008. An installment agreement with the IRS was initiated in\nth\nNovember 2007.\nSOR \u00b6 1.a is a federal tax lien for $23,926.70. This is the amount that Applicant\nand her husband owed to the Internal Revenue Service. The lien was filed in April 2006.\nAt the hearing, Applicant explained that when she started working for her current\nemployer she increased the tax deduction and put in an additional $13,000. She\nseparated her money from her first husband\u2019s money in 1999. She owed approximately\n$10,000 of the total $49,000 tax amount that was due for tax years 1996, 1997, 1999\nand 2000. She has paid all the state taxes. She paid off the lien to the IRS after the\nmarital home was sold in May 2008 (AE E).\nApplicant\u2019s current monthly net income is approximately $10,680. This includes\nher second husband\u2019s income and retirement.  After monthly deductions and expenses,\nshe has a net remainder of approximately $4,100 a month (AE J). She has paid all\ncredit card debt. She and her second husband, who she married very recently, now hold\nsteady positions. They have no difficulty in tracking expenses and paying taxes. They\nare both diligent. Applicant is frugal with her spending. She is driving a 1994 vehicle.\nThey have a budget and are saving income. She is in the best financial shape she has\never been in.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\n\n4\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n\n5\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant had delinquent taxes for the years 1996, 1997, 1999 and\n2000. In April 2006 the IRS filed a federal tax lien against Applicant and her husband.\nThe evidence is sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a\ncloser examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial problems were in great part a result of her husband\u2019s irresponsible behavior.\nShe is now divorced. She is remarried and earning a steady, full-time income. She is in\na sound financial situation.  This potentially mitigating condition applies. \nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above,\nApplicant admitted that her small business/self-employed status, the illness of her\nhusband in 1998, medical expenses, and his lack of gainful employment contributed to\nthe situation which resulted in the tax lien. Now she earns a salary and is remarried.\nShe and her husband are diligent in their fiscal responsibilities. This mitigating condition\napplies.\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant has paid the state and Federal taxes. The lien is\nreleased. The obligation has been fully satisfied. I conclude these potentially mitigating\nconditions apply.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\n\n6\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case.  Applicant served in the military for\nalmost eleven years. She and her husband married while in the military. Applicant is\nhighly educated. She has never shirked her family obligations.\nApplicant\u2019s husband retired from the military in 1992. He had difficulty\ntransitioning to the civilian work world. He would not take positions that were available.\nHe worked at some short term projects but did not add to the family income. He was\ndiagnosed with cancer in 1998. He was not expected to live. Applicant decided to\nremain in the marriage at that time despite the growing marital tensions. \nApplicant\u2019s husband was handling the financial matters after his retirement.\nApplicant had no idea that he was ignoring things. When she learned about the tax\nsituation, she did not have sufficient income to pay all the taxes for the years in\nquestion.\nThe April 2006 lien was satisfied in May 2008 when Applicant and her husband\nsold the marital home. Since Applicant is now divorced and remarried, she is no longer\nsubject to the problems that arose in her marriage. She has always paid her bills and\nvarious accounts. She has not lived in an extravagant manner. She has been in her\ncurrent employment since 2003. She is in a sound financial condition.\nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions and doubts as to\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I\nconclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns arising from financial\nconsiderations. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nFor Applicant\n\n7\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

(Ex. 3) She made $252 payments every two weeks over the five \nand one half year of the plan\u2019s existence. She paid approximately $36,000 over the \n\n \n \n \n3\ncourse of the plan. On February 1, 2005, her debts were discharged. (Tr. 97, Ex. 3)  In \nMay 1999, Applicant had purchased a 1999 Chevrolet pickup ($19,000) and could not \nafford the payments. (Tr. 87, Ex. 3, Schedule D) The bankruptcy was a way to keep the \ntruck. \n \nIn February 2007, when she completed her Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) she listed a paid $3,045 judgment from October \n2003, and unpaid $1,800 judgment from January 2007, a paid $400 to $500 judgment \nfrom October 2005, and a paid judgment from October 2004 for which she did not know \nthe amount. (Ex. 1, pages 26-28)  She also stated on the form that her credit was \nterrible. (Tr. 103, Ex. 1) Applicant says her financial problems arose from making bad \njudgments. (Tr. 116)  \n \nIn February 2008, Applicant contacted the collection agency regarding a $645 \ncredit card debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and a $500 telephone bill (SOR \u00b6 1.e). Applicant paid $150 \non the debt and the collection agency offered to settle the matter for half of the current \nbalance. (Tr. 62, 63) The same creditor is listed in SOR \u00b6 1.b ($645) and SOR \u00b6 1.e \n($518).  Applicant had only one credit card with the creditor. (Tr. 72)  \n \nApplicant owed another credit card company $644 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Applicant has \nattempted to contact this creditor. (Tr. 57) Applicant owed a bank $180 due to a \nchecking account overdraft. (Tr. 76) The debt is with a collection agency, which offered \nto settle the matter for half the balance.  Applicant never responded to the offer. (Tr. 74)  \n \nApplicant and her ex-husband had a number of vehicles repossessed. Even after \nthe divorce, Applicant helped her ex-husband purchase vehicles on which she was \nsolely liable. (Tr. 102) In August 2002, following her divorce, she purchased a 1993 \nFord car that was repossessed, a judgment entered, which has been paid. (Tr. 91, 126)  \nIn November 2003, a $15,000 pickup was purchased for her ex-husband. (Tr. 92) The \ntruck was repossessed and Applicant owes the creditor $6,354 (SOR \u00b6 1.i). The creditor \nhas offered to settle this debt for $4,200, which they wanted as a lump-sum payment. \n(Tr. 81) Applicant was unable to make a lump-sum payment. Applicant has $2,443 in \nher company\u2019s 401 (k) retirement plan and when the balance in the plan is sufficient, \nshe will make a lump-sum payment to this creditor. (Ex. A) \n \nIn May 2005, another pickup was purchased. (Tr. 92, 126) The vehicle was \nrepossessed leaving a balance after repossession of $1,759 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). In November \n2007, the debt was satisfied by garnishment having paid $4,500 on the obligation. In \nMarch 2006, garnishment of $252 every two weeks started. (Tr. 69) In April 2008, \nApplicant purchased a 2005 Pontiac with monthly payments of $420.  \n \nApplicant owes an insurance company $344 (SOR \u00b6 1.h) on her ex-husband \nmotor cycle insurance. (Tr. 77)  Applicant continued to pay her ex-husband\u2019s insurance \nfor four years after the divorce. (Tr. 77)  \n \n \n\n \n \n \n4\nIn October 2007, Applicant completed a personal financial statement listing her \ngross salary for two weeks as $1,607 and her net remainder income at approximately \n$300.

In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \n\n \n \n \n5\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations  \nUnder Guideline F for financial considerations a security concern typically exists \ndue to significant unpaid debts. Failure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy \n\n \n \n \n6\n                                                          \ndebts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.2 \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nupon terms. Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an \napplicant with a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a position of risk \nthat is inconsistent with the holding of a security clearance. An applicant is not required \nto be debt free, but is required to manage her finances so as to meet her financial \nobligations. \n \n \nFinancial considerations become a security concern when a person has \nsignificant delinquent debts. An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of \nhaving to engage in illegal or unethical acts to generate funds to meet financial \nobligations. Additionally, an individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, negligent, or careless in properly safeguarding and \nhandling classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of \nlife provides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nThe record evidence supports a conclusion Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems. Applicant owes approximately $9,000 on seven debts. Disqualifying \nconditions AG \u00b6 19(a) \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c) \u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply.  \n \n \nApplicant has been with her company for more than 16 years. In 2002, Applicant \nwas divorced and the financial problems from that marriage continue. Her attorney was \nforced to garnish her wages to obtain payment for his services in the divorce. Even after \nthe divorce, Applicant continued to pay her ex-husband\u2019s motorcycle insurance and \npurchased vehicles for his use on which she is solely liable. Since 2002, she and her \nex-husband have had four vehicles repossessed and she has had two garnishment \nplaced on her pay. One garnishment was to pay her attorney fees and a second was to \npay for one of the repossessed vehicles. \n \nIn 2005, she completed a Chapter 13, wage earner\u2019s plan, bankruptcy and her \ndebts were discharged. Two years later when she completed her security clearance she \nlisted two unpaid judgments and stated her credit was terrible. Applicant knew of the \nconcern over her finances. She answered interrogatories about her finances in \nNovember 2007. Her supervisor was aware of her financial problems due to a \ngarnishment. He attempted to stress how important it was to correct any financial \nproblem because such problems could result in the loss of her clearance. He frequently \nasked her the state of her finances. Applicant stated she was unaware of how important \nher finances were until the hearing.  \n \n \n2 Revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \u00b6 18. \n\n \n \n \n7\nOther than the garnishments, Applicant contacted one credit collection agency \nand paid them $150. Another creditor offered to settle for half of what was owed, but \nApplicant failed to follow up on the offer. \n \n \nMitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial \nproblem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances, has limited applicability. Since her \n2002 divorce she has been gainfully employed, but has made a single $150 payment to \nher creditors. Applicant has not acted reasonably under the circumstances. Her income \nmay have been limited, but she should have been able to establish a repayment plan \nwith some of the creditors. \n \n \nSeven of the debts remain unpaid. Mitigating conditions AG \u00b6 20 (a) the behavior \nhappened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it \nis unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment, does not apply. The debts in question went unpaid \nstarting in 2002, they are numerous, and did not incurred under unusual circumstances. \n \n \n There is no evidence Applicant has sought financial counseling or demonstrated \na positive change in her financial management. It is not clear the problem is being \nresolved or under control. AG \u00b6 20 (c) \u201cthe person has received or is receiving \ncounseling for the problem and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control,\u201d does not apply nor does AG \u00b6 20 (d) \u201cthe individual \ninitiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.\u201d The \ntwo garnishments do not count because they were initiated by the creditor and not by \nApplicant.  \n \n \nFor AG \u00b6 20 (d) to apply there must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d \nto repay, and evidence of a good-faith effort to repay. A systematic, concrete method of \nhandling her debts is needed, which is not present here. Applicant intends to save \nmoney in her 401(k) plan and make a lump-sum payment to a creditor. This may or may \nnot occur. There is no repayment plan other than her statement that she will pay the \ndebts.  \n \n \nApplicant has made few efforts to resolve the delinquent indebtedness and has \nnot made any real progress in addressing her debts. Given these circumstances, in light \nof the unaddressed delinquent debts, her efforts do not amount to a good-faith effort \nwithin the meaning of the guideline.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n\n \n \n \n8\n \n (1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \n \nApplicant is 40 years old and sufficiently mature to make prudent decisions about \nher finances. She is saving in her 401(k) plan to pay a creditor. Although her intent to \nresolve her financial problems appears to be genuine, she has done little to \ndemonstrate that intent. What is missing is: (1) a realistic and workable plan to address \nher financial problems, (2) documented actions taken in furtherance of the plan, and (3) \na measurable improvement in the situation. Given the current circumstances, it is likely \nthat the financial problems will continue.  \n \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot \nor will not attain the state of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to justify the award \nof a security clearance. The awarding of a security clearance is not a once in a life time \noccurrence, but is based on applying the factors, both disqualifying and mitigating, to \nthe evidence presented. Under the Applicant=s current circumstances a clearance is not \nrecommended, but should the Applicant be afforded an opportunity to reapply for a \nsecurity clearance in the future, having paid the delinquent obligations, established \ncompliance with a repayment plan, or otherwise suitably addressed the obligations, she \nmay well demonstrate persuasive evidence of her security worthiness. However, a \nclearance at this time is not warranted.  \n \n \nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate the financial considerations security concern. Applicant did not meet her \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this \nconclusion, the whole-person concept was given due consideration and that analysis \ndoes not support a favorable decision.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n\n \n \n \n9\n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a-1j: \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n\n \n \n \n1\n \n \n",

AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nFinancial Consideration: \n \n \nUnder financial considerations, failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, \nsatisfy debts, and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation.  An individual who is financially overextended is at risk of having to engage \nin illegal acts to generate funds. (AG \u00b6 18)  Similarly, an individual who is financially \nirresponsible may also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or careless in their obligations to \nprotect classified information. Behaving responsibly or irresponsibly in one aspect of life \nprovides an indication of how a person may behave in other aspects of life.  \n \n \nA person\u2019s relationship with her creditors is a private matter until evidence is \nuncovered demonstrating an inability or unwillingness to repay debts under agreed \nterms.  Absent evidence of strong extenuating or mitigating circumstances, an Applicant \nwith a history of serious or recurring financial difficulties is in a situation of risk \ninconsistent with the holding of a security clearance.  An Applicant is not required to be \ndebt free, but is required to manage her finances in such a way as to meet her financial \nobligations.  Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are a security concern raising Financial \nConsideration Disqualifying Conditions (FC DC) \u00b619(a) (inability or unwillingness to \nsatisfy debts); FC DC \u00b6 19(b) (indebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible \nspending and the absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or \nestablish a realistic plan to pay the debt); FC DC \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations); and FC DC \u00b619(e) (consistent spending beyond one\u2019s means, \nwhich may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant negative cash flow, high \ndebt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis).  Applicant accumulated delinquent \ndebts because of an unwillingness to pay her financial obligations.  The debt total has \nrisen over the years with no indication of any attempt to pay the debts.  The debts \nappear to be for normal consumer items which indicate she may be spending beyond \nher means. \n \n \nI considered Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions (FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) and it does not apply.  Almost all \nof the delinquent debts have not been addressed by Applicant, and they have not been \npaid so they are current debts.  There are a number of delinquent debts from various \nsources so they are not infrequent.  The debts seem to be ordinary credit card debts, \ntelephone bills, department store accounts, or loans.  There is no evidence they were \nincurred under unusual circumstances.  Since the debts are current and not paid, they \ncast doubt on Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.  \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problems \nwere largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \n\n \n5 \n \n \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or separation) and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances).  Applicant claims a nine month \nperiod of unemployment as well as a pay cut when she moved.  However, she \npresented no information on how or why these events impacted her ability to pay her \ndebts.  In fact, since she has been gainfully employed by her present contractor for \nalmost four years, there has been no attempt to pay past due obligations indicating that \nshe is not trying to resolve her indebtedness.  She did not establish she acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances, so the mitigating condition does not apply. \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(a) (the person has received or is receiving counseling \nfor the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or \nis under control).  Applicant presented no information of financial counseling, so this \nmitigating condition does not apply. \n \n \nI considered FC MC \u00b6 20(d) (the individual has initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay the overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts).  For FC MC \u00b6 20(d) to apply, \nthere must be an \u201cability\u201d to repay the debts, the \u201cdesire\u201d to repay, and \u201cevidence\u201d of a \ngood-faith effort to repay.  A systematic, concrete method of handling debts is needed.  \nApplicant presented no information to show she has a plan to pay the debts or any \naction that she has taken to pay her debts.  Applicant has sufficient income to pay her \ndelinquent debts but has not attempted to do so.  Her salary for 2007 was over $60,000, \nand she has a net remainder each month of over $756 that could be used for debt \nreduction.  The only indication of any debt being paid is the one telephone debt which \nseems to be resolved.  Bankruptcy is a legal and permissible means of resolving \nindebtedness.  However, the circumstances of the bankruptcy action can be examined \nto determine any security significance.  The filing of the bankruptcy action in itself does \nnot create a security concern.  However, the fact Applicant did not participate in the \nprocess, and did not complete the action and it was dismissed is another indication of \nher irresponsible and indifferent attitude towards her finances.  There is no indication \nApplicant acted responsibly towards her debts or that the situation is under control.  In \nfact, the opposite seems to be true, her finances are not under control and she has not \nacted responsibly.  The indication is that she just did not pay her debts, and the debts \ncontinued to accumulate.  There is no indication of a good faith effort to pay creditors or \nresolve debts.  Applicant has not presented sufficient information to mitigate security \nconcerns for financial considerations. \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Analysis  \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all \nthe circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the \nconduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and \nmaturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) the \npresence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the \n\n \n6 \n \n \nmotivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the \nultimate determination of whether to grant a security clearance must be an overall \ncommon sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and the \nwhole person concept.  \n \n \nApplicant has not taken action to resolve her past due debts.  Her indifferent \nattitude and lack of actions shows she is not trustworthy, responsible, or exercises good \njudgment.  Applicant has been irresponsible towards her delinquent debts and financial \nobligations.  This is an indication that she might be irresponsible towards the protection \nand handling of classified information.  I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the \nsecurity concerns arising from her finances and personal conduct.  Clearance is denied. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On September 25, 2008, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Carol G.\nRicciardello denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant timely appealed pursuant\nto the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge should have found his\nfinancial difficulties to be mitigated.  Finding no error, we affirm.\nThe Judge made the following factual findings: Of the SOR allegations of debt, Applicant\nadmitted five and denied the others with explanations.  Applicant owes child support for a child from\na prior marriage, and he fell behind while in school and while unemployed or underemployed.\nApplicant pays the current support and some of the arrearage by garnishment.  The money is\ncollected by the child support agency of one state and then transferred to the appropriate agency in\nanother state.  Applicant was unable to state the current amount of his arrearage because he had not\ncontacted the offices in either state in the past year to determine the amount of the arrearage.  At\ntimes, two of Applicant\u2019s other debts are collected by garnishment, but Applicant was unable to state\nthe current balance on the debts.   Applicant has taken no action to pay his other debts.  However,\n1\nApplicant testified that he recently filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and his mother loaned him the\nmoney to hire a lawyer to file the paperwork.  Applicant\u2019s wife quit work to have a baby shortly\nbefore the hearing.  Without her income, it appears that their expenses exceed their income.\nApplicant\u2019s wife is seeking employment again.\nApplicant\u2019s appeal restates his testimony as to why his financial difficulties should be\nconsidered mitigated, because they occurred a long time ago and for reasons beyond Applicant\u2019s\ncontrol.  On appeal, the information regarding mitigation is stated in greater detail than it was at the\nhearing.  Applicant also explains that his bankruptcy is proceeding.  The Board cannot consider any\nnew information in Applicant\u2019s appeal, because the Directive does not allow the Board to consider\nnew evidence.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.\nApplicant argues that he has mitigated any security concerns that might exist under Guideline\nF and that the Judge did not give adequate weight to his evidence of mitigation.  Applicant admitted\nfive of the SOR allegations against him.  The burden then shifted to Applicant to extenuate or\nmitigate the security concerns raised by the SOR allegations.  The Judge concluded that Applicant\ndid not present evidence sufficient to overcome the security concerns raised.  She concluded that the\ndebts were recent since they remained unpaid at the time of the hearing, and she concluded that while\nschool and periods of unemployment contributed to the debt delinquencies, Applicant did not act\nreasonably inasmuch as he virtually ignored his debts.\nThe application of disqualifying and mitigating conditions does not turn simply on a finding\nthat one or more of them apply to the particular facts of a case.  Thus, the presence of some\nmitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security determination.\nAs the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable\n\n3\nevidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the\nJudge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence,\nis not sufficient to demonstrate error on the part of the Judge.  See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 07-18303 at\n2-3 (App. Bd. Nov. 13, 2008).  After a review of the record, the Board concludes that the Judge\u2019s\nfindings and conclusions are reasonably supported by the record.  Thus, the Judge\u2019s decision is\nsustainable.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s decision denying Applicant a security clearance is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: Jeffrey D. Billett       \nJeffrey D.

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn March 25, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nto Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on April 30, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to me on August 8, \n2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on August 19, 2008, and I convened the hearing \nas scheduled on September 10, 2008.

The denied the \nremaining allegations with explanations. His admissions to the allegations in the SOR \nare incorporated herein. In addition, after a thorough and careful review of the \npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old engineering analyst technician who is employed by a \ndefense contractor. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in August 2007 and participated in \na co-operative program offered by his present employer where he worked and went to \nschool in exchange for tuition and a commitment of employment for a period of time. He \nintends to go back to school in January 2009 while continuing his employment. He \nserved in the Army from 1994 to 1999 and was honorably discharged.1  \n \n \nApplicant was married in 1993, separated from his wife in approximately 1995, \nand finally divorced in 2002. He has a daughter from the marriage born in 1994. He is \nrequired to pay $372 monthly in child support. He admitted he fell behind for different \nperiods of time when he was attending school, was unemployed or was not earning \nenough money. He admitted that sometimes he would pay a lesser amount than what \nwas ordered. He is paying his child support and an additional amount each month to \npay his back child support. He does not know how much he is in arrears, but estimated \nit is approximately $3,000 to $4,000. He testified that there are two states listed in the \nSOR that allege he is in arrears. This is because he pays the support through one \nstate\u2019s child support enforcement agency and it was not credited in the state where the \nchild lives. His tax returns for the past three years have been seized to pay some of his \narrearages. The support payments are garnished directly from his wages. Applicant \nadmitted that he had not contacted the different states\u2019 child support offices\u2019 in the past \nyear to see what the current status of his child support arrearages are.2 \n \n \nApplicant remarried in 2004 and has two small children. His wife was employed, \nbut recently had their second child and is not working.  \n \n \nApplicant also pays through garnishment the judgment listed in SOR 1. h. This is \na credit card debt. He believes he opened the account sometime in 1994. He does not \nknow how much he still owes but believes it may be $87. The original amount owed was \n$841. Applicant pays the judgment listed in SOR 1.e through garnishment of his pay. \nHe testified that his employer is only permitted to garnish up to 25% of his pay at one \ntime, so he does not know exactly how much is being paid for this debt. The judgment \nwas originally for $1,770. This debt was for a car that was repossessed in either 2001 or \n2002, Applicant could not remember.  \n \n1 Tr. 52-54. \n \n2 Tr. 20-38, 55-60, 91-94; GE 5; Answer to SOR. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nThe debt listed in SOR 1.a for $91 is for cable services from 1999. It is not paid.3 \n \n \nThe debt listed in SOR 1.b for $127 is for a dental bill from approximately five or \nsix years ago. He could not remember and it is not paid.4 \n \n \nThe debt listed in SOR 1.c for $79 is for a veterinary bill from 2002 for Applicant\u2019s \ncat. Applicant stated that prior to bringing the cat to the veterinarian he inquired as to \nthe cost of the services. When the services were completed he was provided with a \nlarger bill than he was originally told. Applicant disagreed and only paid a portion of the \nbill. Although he disputes the debt, he has not contacted the creditor, he did not provide \nproof that he paid anything on the bill, and he has not disputed it with the credit bureau.5  \n \n \nThe debt listed in SOR 1.d for $1,245 is a credit card debt. Applicant went over \nthe spending limit and attempted to discontinue the card, but because he was over the \nlimit the card was not canceled. Applicant has taken no steps to make payments on this \ndebt that has been owed since 2002.6 \n \n \nThe debt listed in SOR 1.e for $1,770 is a judgment for car repossession. He \nbought the car in 2000 or 2001 and it was repossessed a few months after the \ntransaction. He stated that an amount is being garnished from his pay, but he does not \nknow how much he is paying or how much he owes.7  \n \n \nThe debt in SOR 1.f for $374 is a judgment from an apartment complex where \nApplicant and his second wife lived. He did not provide the apartment complex with a \nforwarding address when they moved. He denied the debt because he stated he had \nnot been contacted by the creditor. He has not taken any action to pay or resolve this \ndebt.8 \n \n \nThe debt listed in SOR 1.g was for a debit card transaction at a convenience \nstore. He owes $33 and has not paid the debt. He estimated the debt is about five years \nold.9 \n \n \nThe debt listed in SOR 1.h for $841 is a judgment for a delinquent credit card. \nApplicant opened the card in approximately 1994. He stated an amount is being \n \n3 Tr. 60-61. \n \n4 Tr. 61-62. \n \n5 Tr. 62-64. \n \n6 Tr. 64-65. \n \n7 Tr. 43-50. \n \n8 Tr. 65-69; GE2 at page 32. \n \n9 Tr. 69-70. \n\n \n4 \n \n \n                                                          \ngarnished from his wages to pay this judgment, but he did not know how much is being \ngarnished and how much is left to pay. He has not checked the status with his payroll \ndepartment.10  \n \n \nThe debt listed in SOR 1.i is for a cell phone debt that he did not pay. He owes \napproximately $389 and the debt was incurred in 1994.11 \n \n \nApplicant stated he recently filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy and was required to \nattend credit counseling. He has not sought or attended any other financial counseling. \nHe hired a lawyer three weeks ago and paid $1,087 for the services. His mother loaned \nhim the money and agreed to accept $100 a month in repayment once Applicant\u2019s debts \nare discharged. Applicant has approximately $13,000 in student loans that are in a \ndeferred status. He intends to start paying them in the spring. He stated that since \ncompleting school and working full time, he has been making progress toward \nimproving his financial situation. He believes his negative financial situation was due to \nthe transition after he was discharged from the military in 1999 and then later he \ndivorced.12  \n \n \nApplicant believes he grosses approximately $34,000 a year. He stated his wife \nrecently purchased a house. At the time of the purchase she was employed. She is \ncurrently looking for employment to resume working. Applicant listed his expenses and \nbased on his monthly income, it appears his expenses exceed his income. He stated \n\u201cwe\u2019re a little worried at this point.\u201d They have been using a refund from his wife\u2019s tax \nreturns to help pay the bills while she has been unemployed after having their baby. 13 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s second level supervisor testified on his behalf. He testified Applicant \nis reliable, on time and \u201cserves his purposes well.\u201d He works well in a team \nenvironment.14 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n \n10 Tr. 40-43, 70-71. \n \n11 Tr. 71-74. \n \n12 Tr. 86-89, 94-95. \n \n13 Tr. 51-52, 74-86. \n \n14 Tr. 99-106. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201dThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18: \u201cFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual=s \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. An individual who \n\n \n6 \n \n \nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.\u201d  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them and especially considered AG & 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness \nto satisfy debts\u201d) and (c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). Applicant has \nmany debts that have been delinquent for a long time that remain unpaid. Applicant has \nbeen unable and unwilling to pay his delinquent debts. He has not taken action to pay \neven the smallest debts. The only debts that are being paid are because a judgment \nwas obtained and his wages are being garnished. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions and especially considered AG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, \nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment\u201d); (b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d); (c) (\u201cthe individual has received or is \nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control\u201d); (d) (\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d) and (e) (\u201cthe individual has a \nreasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of the \nproblem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or \nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue\u201d). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s behavior is recent because he has many delinquent debts that remain \nunpaid. Some of his delinquent debts are many years old and Applicant has not made \nany effort to resolve them. The delinquent debts that are being paid are being done so \nthrough garnishment and after judgments were obtained. Some of the debts are for \nsmall amounts, yet he has not made an effort to pay them. Applicant was going to \nschool and experienced periods of unemployment, but there is no evidence he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. To the contrary, he has virtually ignored his debts, \ndemonstrating his lack of good judgment. I find (a) and (b) do not apply.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s plan for resolving his delinquent debts is to file for bankruptcy. He \nstated he recently hired a lawyer to assist him. He does not have a budget or a realistic \nplan for resolving his debts. At this juncture, he did not provide any documentation to \nsupport his actions and his debts remain a concern. The only financial counseling \nApplicant claimed he has had is what was mandated for his bankruptcy. Applicant has \nnot made a good-faith effort to resolve his delinquent debts. He has actually shown little \neffort or initiative to resolve them. There are not clear indications the problem is being \nresolved. He has not contacted creditors with whom he disputes certain debts. He \ndisputes a debt with a former landlord and claims he did not know about it and was not \ncontacted; however he admits he never provided a forwarding address. Regarding other \n\n \n7 \n \n \ndisputed debts, he has not contacted the creditors or made any efforts to resolve the \ndebts. He did not provide any documentation to support his assertions that he is \ndisputing them. Applicant did provide some information that he is paying his child \nsupport, but admitted he is in arrears. Some of Applicant\u2019s debts are being paid through \ngarnishment, but he does not know the current balances remaining. Applicant has \nignored his financial responsibilities. I find (c), (d), and (e) do not apply.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has numerous delinquent \ndebts that have been unpaid for years. He experienced some periods of unemployment \nand went through a divorce, but years have passed and he continues to ignore his \nresponsibilities to his creditors. Even after becoming aware in March 2008 that these \nissues were security concerns, he did not take action to pay even the smallest debt. \nAlthough he stated he is filing bankruptcy to discharge his debts, it appears these \nactions were only taken in the past few weeks. Applicant has been irresponsible in his \nfinances and has not provided any indication that he has changed his behavior. Overall, \nthe record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed \nto mitigate the security concerns arising from financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n\n \n8 \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

He denied the allegations in \u00b6\u00b61.b, 1.c, 1.m, 2.h, 2.i, 2.k, and 3.a \u2013 3.c. During the hearing he admitted to the allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 2.h, 2.i, and 2.k. (Tr at 55-57.) Applicant is a 39-year-old paint foreman employed by a Department of Defense contractor seeking a security clearance. This is his first time applying for a security clearance.

Marine, Esquire, Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nHOGAN, Erin C., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing \n(e-QIP), on September 29, 2006. On October 18, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security \nconcerns under Guideline F, Financial Considerations; Guideline J, Criminal Conduct; \nand Guideline E, Personal Conduct for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the \nrevised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, \n2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September \n1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn November 27, 2007, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing \nbefore an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on \nDecember 27, 2007. The case was assigned to me on January 3, 2008. DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing on January 22, 2008, and I convened the hearing as scheduled on \nFebruary 3, 2008. The government offered Exhibits (Gov Ex) 1 through 9, which were \nadmitted without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted no \nFebruary 27, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \ndocuments. His wife served as a witness/personal representative. DOHA received the \ntranscript of the hearing (Tr) on February 14, 2008. The record closed on that date. \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \n \nProcedural Issue \n \nThe Notice of Hearing was sent out exactly 15 days prior to the hearing date. Applicant \nsigned for receipt of the Notice of Hearing on January 29, 2008 which is less than 15 \ndays from the hearing date.  Enclosure 3, Additional Procedural Guidance, of the \nDirective, \u00b6 E3.1.8 states the Applicant will be notified at least 15 days in advance of the \ntime and place of the hearing.  Applicant waived the 15 day notice requirement.  The \nGovernment noted that Applicant agreed to the February 6, 2008, hearing date on \nJanuary 16, 2008. (Tr at 9-11.) \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated November 27, 2007, Applicant admitted the \nfactual allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d -1.j, 1.l, 1.n, 2.a-2.g, and 2.j.  He denied the allegations \nin \u00b6\u00b61.b, 1.c, 1.m, 2.h, 2.i, 2.k, and 3.a \u2013 3.c.  During the hearing he admitted to the \nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 2.h, 2.i, and 2.k. (Tr at 55-57.) \n \nApplicant is a 39-year-old paint foreman employed by a Department of Defense \ncontractor seeking a security clearance.  This is his first time applying for a security \nclearance.  He has worked for his current employer since October 2002. He is a high \nschool graduate. He is married and has a 16-year-old daughter and a 12-year-old step \ndaughter. (Tr at 5-7, 22, 26; Gov 1.)   \n \nApplicant\u2019s background investigation revealed the following delinquent debts: an \n$18,106 collection account for a deficiency amount from a truck which was repossessed \nin November 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); a $960 medical account placed for collection in May \n2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); a $214 account placed for collection in March 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); a \n$96 account placed for collection in May 2005 ( SOR \u00b6 1.d); a $199 utility bill placed for \ncollection in March 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.e); a $1,691 credit card account, charged off in       \n(SOR \u00b6 1.f); a $639 department store credit account placed for collection in 2002 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.g); a $3,017 bank loan that was charged off in 2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.h); a $16,583 mobile \nhome loan account that was charged off in 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.i); a  $25 cell phone account \nplaced for collection in July 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.j); a $198 collection account (SOR \u00b6 1.k); a \n$11,420 child support account placed for collection in December 2003 (SOR \u00b6 1.l); a \n$4,990 collection account (SOR \u00b6 1.m); and a $105 water service account placed for \ncollection (SOR \u00b6 1.n). (Gov 2; Gov 3.) \n \nApplicant experienced financial problems as a result of a nine-month period of \nunemployment in 2002.  During this time, he collected $700 every two weeks in \nunemployment checks but it was not enough to keep up with his bills. (Tr at 24-25.) \nApplicant\u2019s truck (SOR \u00b6 1.a), five wheel trailer (SOR \u00b6 1.h), and mobile home (SOR \u00b6 \n\n \n3 \n \n \n1.i) were repossessed as a result. He also incurred additional delinquent debts. The \nmedical debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b should have been paid by insurance.  Applicant was \ninvolved in a car accident where the other driver was at fault in 2004. The bill was for \nApplicant\u2019s medical treatment as a result of the accident. (Tr at 31-33.) He either does \nnot recognize or disputes the bills alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, 1.f, 1.k, 1.m. He took no \nofficial action to dispute these debts. (Tr at 33-35, 40.)  He has made no efforts to pay \nor resolve the remaining consumer debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.e, 1.g, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, \n1.m, and 1.n. (Tr at 27-46.) \n \nIn 1998, Applicant stopped paying child support because he was unable to pay it. \nThe court garnished his wages in 2002. In December 2003, he owed approximately \n$11,420 in delinquent child support (SOR \u00b6 1.l; Gov 2 at 5.)  Applicant currently pays \n$426 in child support and is current on all child support payments. (Tr at 26, 40-42.) A \ncredit report, dated September 8, 2007, verifies this. (Gov 3 at 2.)   \n \nApplicant has not attended financial counseling.  He makes $20.87 an hour with \ntime and half for overtime. (Tr at 22.) His wife earns approximately $800 per month. \nTheir monthly rent is $1,000 a month. (Tr at 49.) They still owe $2,000 in income taxes \nfor tax year 2006.  They have not entered into a payment agreement with the Internal \nRevenue Service. (Tr at 49-50.)  In 2006, he received a $30,000 insurance settlement.  \nThe settlement was applied to other bills and extensive dental work he and his wife \nneeded done. (Tr at 65-67.) \n \nBetween June 11, 1989 and February 8, 2003, Applicant was arrested and \ncharged with numerous offenses on eleven occasions.  The offenses include two driving \nwhile intoxicated offenses in 1989 and 1999; eight offenses of driving while his license \nwas revoked and/or under restraint. \n \nOn June 11, 1989, he was arrested and charged with Drive a Vehicle when BAC \n0.10 or more; Driving a Vehicle While Under the Influence; No Liability Insurance; and \nDefective Vehicle. (Gov 4 at 4; Gov 5 at 26.)  \n \nOn December 13, 1989, he was charged with Driving a Vehicle While His \nLicense was Revoked. (Gov 5 at 2-7.)  \n \nOn February 17, 1996 he was charged with Harassment via Telephone.  The \ncharge was later dismissed. (Gov 5 at 21-25; Gov 9 at 16-17.) \n \nOn April 31, 1997, he was charged with Use of a Foreign License During \nSuspension; Operating a Vehicle Without Insurance; Operation of Unsafe Vehicle; \nCareless Driving.  The first charge was dismissed and Applicant pled guilty to the \nremaining charges. Part of his sentence included 48 hours of useful public service.  \nApplicant did not complete the 48 hours of public service and a bench warrant was \nissued.  He was ordered to spend 10 additional days in confinement in lieu of public \nservice. (Gov 9 at 18-20.) \n \n\n \n4 \n \n \nOn April 17, 1998, Applicant was arrested and charged with Drove Motor Vehicle \nWhen License Under Restraint (Revoked). Applicant pled to the charge of Driving \nWithout a Valid License.  He paid a fine and court costs totaling $57. (Gov 4 at 4; Gov 9 \nat 25-26.) He was also charged with Failure to Comply \u2013 Contempt of Court for failure to \nperform 48 hours of useful public service. (Gov 4 at 4; Gov 5 at 15-20; Gov 7.) \n \nOn April 27, 1998, Applicant was charged with Permit Unauthorized Person to \nDrive; Driving When License Under Restraint; and Safety Belt Violation. He pled to the \nfirst tow charges and paid $155 in fines and court costs. (Gov 4 at 4; Gov 5 at 19; Gov 9 \nat 23-26.) \n \nOn May 8, 1998, Applicant was charged with Driving When License Under \nRestraint. He pled guilty and was ordered to perform 24 hours of useful public service, \nspend 90 days in jail and paid $188 in fines and court costs.  He failed to complete the \n24 hours of useful public service. A bench warrant was issued and he was arrested on \nApril 26, 1999. He was resentenced to five days in jail in lieu of completing public \nservice. (Gov 9 at 1-3.) \n \nOn January 24, 1999, Applicant was arrested and charged with Failure to Drive \nin a Single Lane; Drove a Vehicle While License Under Revocation; Operated \nUninsured Motor Vehicle on a Public Roadway; Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol \u2013 \nSecond Offense; Driving While Ability Impaired. He pled guilty to Driving While Ability \nImpaired and all other charges were dismissed.  He was sentenced to six days in jail, 24 \nmonths supervised probation, 48 hours useful public service, attend alcohol therapy and \npay $474 in fines, fees, and court costs. He failed to comply with court-ordered alcohol \ntreatment. A bench warrant was issued and Applicant was taken into custody pursuant \nto this warrant.  He was sentenced to 24 months probation and six days in jail; and 48 \nhours of additional useful public service. (Gov 4 at 4; Gov 7; Gov 9 at 4-15.) \n \nOn March 21, 2000, Applicant was arrested and charged with Drove Vehicle \nWhen Licensed Revoked as a Habitual Offender; Drove Vehicle When License Under \nRestraint (Revoked) and Improper Lane Use. He pled guilty to Improper Lane change \nand the other charges were dismissed. He paid $86 in fines, fees, and court costs and \nwas ordered to refrain from driving until his license was reinstated. (Gov 4 at 4; Gov 5 at \n8-14; Gov 9 at 27-28.) \n \nOn February 8, 2003, Applicant was arrested for Driving After Revocation \u2013 \nProhibited.  He was found guilty and ordered to pay $139 in fines, fees, and court costs \nand ordered to spend 75 days in confinement in a work release facility. (Gov 4 at 4; Gov \n6; Gov 8.) \n \nApplicant has not been arrested since 2003.  He has completed all of his court-\nordered requirements and probation. (Tr at 62-63.) He admits to driving to work and to \nthe grocery store while his license was revoked.  He did not seek the court\u2019s permission \nto drive to work or to the grocery store. His driver\u2019s license was re-instated in the \nsummer 2006. (Tr at 53-55.) \n\n \n5 \n \n \n          \n \nWhen Applicant completed his September 29, 2006, e-QIP application, in \nresponse to question 23(d) which asks \u201cHave you ever been charged with or convicted \nof any offense(s) related to alcohol or drugs?,\u201d he listed his January 1999 DUI offense \nbut not his June 1989 DUI offense.  He also did not list his arrests alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.j \nand 2.k in response to question 23(f), \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you been arrested for, \ncharged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not listed in response to a, b, c, d, or e \nabove? (Leave out traffic fines of less than $150 unless the violation was alcohol or \ndrug related.).\u201d (Gov 1.) In response to question 28(a), \u201cIn the last 7 years, have you \nbeen over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?,\u201d Applicant listed the debts that are \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.h, and 1.i.  He did not list the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b -1.g, \nand 1.j \u2013 1.n. (Gov 1).   \n \nApplicant states that he did not intentionally falsify his e-QIP application.  He did \nnot recall the details of his 1989 DUI arrest and the two other offenses. He listed the \ndebts that he knew were over 180 days old. (Tr at 21, 52, 59, 61; Response to SOR.)  \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor testified that Applicant has worked for him since 2002. He \ntrusts him to do a good job. He has no concerns with Applicant having a security \nclearance. (Tr at 69-73.) \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) &19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts) and FC DC & 19(c), (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case due to his history of not meeting financial \nobligations. At the close of the record, 13 unresolved delinquent debts remain, an \napproximate total balance of over $28,000.   \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n\n \n7 \n \n \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. Aside \nfrom his child support obligation, all of the other delinquent debts remain unresolved. In \naddition, Applicant has a $2,000 unresolved tax debt for tax year 2006. His financial \nissues are current. \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies, in part, due to Applicant\u2019s nine \nmonth period of unemployment in 2002. However, Applicant has been employed \ncontinuously since November 2002 and has taken no action to resolve or dispute his \ndelinquent accounts. I cannot conclude that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances.  \n \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply.  Applicant has not attended financial counseling and his \ndelinquent debts remain unresolved. It is unlikely that the debts will be resolved in the \nnear future.  \n \nFC MC & 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies, with respect to the Applicant\u2019s delinquent \nchild support but not the other unresolved debts.  \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(e) (the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of \nthe past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented proof to \nsubstantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the \nissue) had the potential to apply to several debts which Applicant disputes. However, he \ntook no action to resolve the disputed debts.  As such, it does not apply. \n \nApplicant has not mitigated the concerns raised under financial considerations. \n \nCriminal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern raised under the criminal conduct guideline is set forth in \u00b6 \n30 of the Revised Adjudicative Guidelines: \n \n \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \n \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability \n \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nThere are two Criminal Conduct Disqualifying Conditions (CC DC) which apply to \nApplicant\u2019s case. CC DC \u00b6 31(a) (a single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses) and \nCC DC \u00b6 31(c) (allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \n\n \n8 \n \n \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted) apply.  From 1989 to \n2003, Applicant was arrested or charged with offenses on 11 occasions, including two \nDUI arrests and eight charges of driving while his license was revoked. Repeatedly \nviolating court orders which revoked his license raise a concern about Applicant\u2019s ability \nto follow rules and regulations.    \n \nThe criminal conduct concern can be mitigated. I find that Criminal Conduct \nMitigating Condition (CC MC) \u00b6 32(a) (so much time has elapsed since the criminal \nbehavior happened, or it happened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment) applies.  Applicant has not been arrested or charged with an offense since \nFebruary 2003.  He has become more responsible over the five year period since his \nlast offense.  CC MC \u00b6 32(d) (there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including \nbut not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive \ncommunity involvement) applies.  More than five years have passed since Applicant\u2019s \nlast arrest. He completed the terms of his sentences and his license was reinstated in \n2006.  He has a good employment record. \n \nApplicant has mitigated the criminal conduct concern. \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG &15: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s omissions on his September 29, 2006, e-QIP application raises the \npotential applications of Personal Conduct Disqualifying Condition (PC DC) \u00b6 16(a) \n(deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel \nsecurity questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct \ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities).  Applicant\u2019s explanation that he did not list his 1989 DUI arrest in \nresponse to question 23(d) and some of his delinquent debts in response to question \n28(a) because he could not recall the information is credible. He listed the most recent \nDUI arrest in response to question 23(d).  He listed the debts which have the highest \ndelinquent balances in response to question 28(a).  \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \n \nI also find that Applicant did not deliberately omit his March 21, 2000 arrest for \nDrove Vehicle While License Revoked as a Habitual Offender; Drove Vehicle When \nLicense Under Restraint (Revoked); and Improper Lane Use in response to question \n23(f) on his e-QIP application.  The end result of the arrest was a guilty plea to Improper \nLane Use with a minimal fine that was under $150.  The plain language of question 23(f) \ntells Applicants to leave off traffic offenses that were under $150. A reasonable person \ncould understand that they were not required to list the offense considering that it was a \ntraffic offense with a fine under $150. More problematic is Applicant\u2019s omission of his \nFebruary 8, 2003, arrest for Driving After Revocation Prohibited. Not only was he fined \nbut he was sentenced to 75 days confinement on a work release program. The \ndisposition of this charge was much more serious and it is unlikely that Applicant forgot \nabout this offense. His license was not reinstated until the summer 2006, just a few \nmonths prior to the completion of his e-QIP application. I find his explanation that he \nforgot this arrest less credible. FC DC \u00b6 16(a) applies with respect to this allegation. \n \n \nThe personal conduct concern may be mitigated.  Personal Conduct Mitigating \nCondition (PC MC) \u00b6 17(a) (the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts) has the \npotential to apply.  It does not apply because Applicant did not disclose the omission \nbefore being confronted with the facts.  None of the other PC MCs are relevant to the \nfacts of Applicant\u2019s case. He has not mitigated the concerns raised under personal \nconduct.  \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered Applicant\u2019s favorable \nwork history and his clean record of no subsequent criminal conduct over a period of \nfive years.  While some of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts occurred due to circumstances \nbeyond his control due to a nine month period of unemployment, he took no steps to \nresolve his delinquent accounts, even though he has been employed full time since \n\n \n10 \n \n \nNovember 2002.  He did not meet his burden to mitigate his omission of his February 8, \n2003, arrest in response to question 23(f) on his September 29, 2006 e-QIP application.   \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nand suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed \nto mitigate the security concerns arising under financial considerations, and personal \nconduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline J:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nFor Applicant  \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n \n \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor, where he has worked for three and a half years. Due to heavy drinking for many years and his separation and divorce from his first wife in the late 1990s, he fell behind on many bills, despite regular employment as an electrician or tool operator since 1998. He is now remarried, with no children. (GE 1 at 1-4; AE A at 33; Tr. at 33.) Applicant\u2019s credit bureau reports (CBRs), from July 2006 through May 2008, show an extensive history of delinquent debts and judgments, the reported number of which have declined. (GE 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10.) The evidence shows that some of the debts were repaid, but many appear to have simply dropped off or disappeared because the later CBRs are from a different company than the earlier ones. In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted that he owed those debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and 1.e (formerly 1.j). During the hearing, he testified that he still had not paid any of those debts. (Tr. at 24-32.) The first three of these involve medical accounts, placed for collection, in the total amount of $1,163. He testified to minimal, if any, effort to contact these creditors or resolve the debts. The fourth of these debts is a judgment obtained against him by a finance company in July 2006, in the amount of $2,746. He purchased a computer on credit from an individual salesman.

Howry, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nWHITE, David M., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant has substantial delinquent debt that he cannot afford to repay. His 25-\nyear criminal history includes burglary, assault, and driving offenses, most recently in\n2005, and he remains on probation. Based upon a thorough review of the case file,\npleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is\ndenied. \nApplicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86), on February 22,\n2006. On February 26, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR), that for some unexplained reason was dated\nMarch 16, 2008, to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines F and J. The\naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information\nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive\n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2,\n1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG)\npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the\nDepartment of Defense (DoD) for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nAugust 26, 2008\n\n2\nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on March 5, 2008. He answered the\nSOR in writing on April 10, 2008, and requested a hearing before an administrative\njudge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed on May 14, 2008, and DOHA\nassigned the case to me on May 15, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on June 10, 2008, and Applicant acknowledged\nreceiving it at least 15 days before the hearing. (Tr. at 10.) Although his signed receipt\nfor the SOR that was delivered through his company\u2019s facility security officer was dated\nJune 13, 2008, he did receive a copy of the notice via electronic mail on June 10, 2008.\nI convened the hearing as scheduled on June 25, 2008. Department Counsel offered\nGovernment Exhibits (GE) 1 through 11, which were admitted without objection.\nApplicant testified on his own behalf, and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibit (AE) A, which\nwas admitted without objection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to leave the record open\nuntil July 7, 2008, in order for him to submit additional evidence. DOHA received the\ntranscript of the hearing (Tr.) on July 3, 2008. On July 3, 2008, Applicant submitted two\nadditional documents to Department Counsel. He did not submit any further evidence,\nand Department Counsel forwarded Applicant\u2019s submission without objection to its\nconsideration on July 7, 2008. These documents were marked AE B, and the record\nwas closed.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor, where he has\nworked for three and a half years. Due to heavy drinking for many years and his\nseparation and divorce from his first wife in the late 1990s, he fell behind on many bills,\ndespite regular employment as an electrician or tool operator since 1998. He is now\nremarried, with no children. (GE 1 at 1-4; AE A at 33; Tr. at 33.) \nApplicant\u2019s credit bureau reports (CBRs), from July 2006 through May 2008,\nshow an extensive history of delinquent debts and judgments, the reported number of\nwhich have declined. (GE 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10.) The evidence shows that some of the debts\nwere repaid, but many appear to have simply dropped off or disappeared because the\nlater CBRs are from a different company than the earlier ones. In his response to the\nSOR, Applicant admitted that he owed those debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d, and\n1.e (formerly 1.j). During the hearing, he testified that he still had not paid any of those\ndebts. (Tr. at 24-32.) The first three of these involve medical accounts, placed for\ncollection, in the total amount of $1,163. He testified to minimal, if any, effort to contact\nthese creditors or resolve the debts. The fourth of these debts is a judgment obtained\nagainst him by a finance company in July 2006, in the amount of $2,746. He purchased\na computer on credit from an individual salesman. When the computer stopped working,\nhe found out there was no warranty, so he stopped making payments on the loan he\ntook out to finance its purchase. He did not contest the case in court. (Tr. at 30-32, 50-\n52.)\nApplicant denied owing the $5,212 medical bill, alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, which\nremains on his most recent CBR in an amount of $5,266. Applicant denied owing this\n\n3\nbill because he does not remember receiving medical treatment during the time the bill\narose. It consistently appears on every record CBR. He called the credit bureau and\norally disputed the bill, which is noted on the latest two CBRs. His dispute has not yet\nbeen resolved. (Tr. at 28-29.) He also denied owing the $4,991 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6\n1.f (formerly 1.k). Although first listed separately in his July 2006 CBR (GE 3 at 8) as\nboth an ongoing past due debt and a collection account, comparing the CBR listings\nshows that this reported debt is to the same creditor and involves the same loan that\nwas reduced to judgment and alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. Accordingly, this is not a separate\ndebt. \nApplicant\u2019s most recently submitted personal financial statement reflects a net\nmonthly salary of $2,344, and monthly expenses of $1,848 comprising only rent,\ngroceries, utilities and car expenses. It further shows $229 in monthly debt payments for\npublic storage and a 401k loan repayment, leaving a net remainder of $266 to use for all\nother living expenses and delinquent debt reduction. It is noted that the monthly utility\nestimate submitted with this July 2009 statement is $430 less than was shown on his\nstatement submitted in January 2008. He further reported assets of $35 in a savings\naccount, $86 in a checking account, and a car worth $500. Applicant\u2019s wife no longer\nworks, since she stays home to take care of his mother who lives with them. He said,\nwithout corroborating evidence, that his step-father\u2019s estate is being probated, and he\nanticipates inheriting $20-25,000 to use toward debt reduction when that is finalized.\n(AE B at 4; GE 6 at 69; Tr. at 44, 46-47.)\nApplicant also admitted the truth of all the criminal conduct allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6\n2.a through 2.g, except for \u00b6 2.b, which he denied. Department Counsel advised that,\nalthough there was a good faith basis for that allegation, he had no evidence to support\nit. Accordingly, that allegation was not established. (Tr. at 38.) Applicant\u2019s admissions\nare incorporated in the following findings concerning his criminal conduct.\nIn January 1983, when Applicant was 25 years old, he was arrested and charged\nwith burglary, theft, and attempted burglary after a friend, with whom he had been\ndrinking, broke into a store and stole some items while they were together. He reached\na plea agreement resulting in conviction of the latter charge and dismissal of the first\ntwo. He was sentenced to three years probation. (GE 2 at 3; Tr. at 41-42.) On February\n9, 1993, at age 35, he was arrested and charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI)\nand reckless endangerment. He was convicted on guilty pleas to negligent driving and\nreckless endangerment, resulting in a fine, 30 days in jail (suspended), and probation.\nHe was also required to complete a three-day alcohol safety course. (Tr. at 41.)\nIn both April and June of 1995, Applicant was arrested after domestic violence\nincidents and charged with assault on his then-live-in girlfriend. The first incident\nresulted in his conviction, a suspended sentence to a year in jail, a fine and a required\nanger-management course. The latter charge was dismissed when his girlfriend did not\nappear to testify. (Tr. at 39-40.) On December 29, 2000, he was arrested for driving with\nexpired plates and without compulsory insurance. The first charge was dismissed\n\n4\nbecause he had just not had time to change his plates, but he was fined $400 for the\ninsurance violation. (Tr. at 39.)\nOn March 17, 2005, after an evening of drinking at a pool tournament, Applicant\nwas arrested and charged with Driving Under the Influence (DUI.) His blood alcohol\ncontent was measured at .146%, almost twice the legal limit of .08%. He entered into a\ndeferred prosecution agreement, requiring him to serve five years probation, pay a fine\nand restitution, attend an alcohol treatment program and use a DUI ignition interlock for\ntwo years. Upon entering the treatment program, he was diagnosed as alcohol\ndependent and prescribed a two-year program, starting with 12 weeks of intensive\noutpatient treatment, followed by aftercare at the treatment center and AA meetings. He\nsuccessfully completed the court-ordered alcohol treatment program on August 3, 2007,\nwith a \u201cvery good\u201d prognosis from the head counselor of the program. He has remained\nabstinent since this DUI arrest, and intends to continue doing so. His probation will\ncontinue until June 2010, until which time he remains subject to the terms of the\ndeferred prosecution agreement. (AE A at 32-33, 37-38; AE B at 3; Tr. at 35-37, 42-43,\n45, 48-50.)\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used to evaluate\nan applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\u00b6\n2(a) and 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in\nthe context of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The\nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person,\npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified\ninformation will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I\nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the\nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is\nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or\nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the\n\n5\nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d Section 7\nof Executive Order 10865 provides that \u201cAny determination under this order adverse to\nan applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no\nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nA person applying for access to classified information seeks to enter into a\nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations:\nFailure or inability to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially over-\nextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\nCompulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes\nincluding espionage. Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources\nof income is also a security concern. It may indicate proceeds from\nfinancially profitable criminal acts.\nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. Of these nine different disqualifying conditions, the Government asserted\nthat two were raised by Applicant\u2019s financial circumstances: \u201c(a) inability or\nunwillingness to satisfy debts;\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\n(Tr. at 56.)\nApplicant has at least a ten-year history of failing to satisfy legitimate financial\nobligations, both large and small. He still has at least five SOR-alleged unresolved\ndelinquent debts totaling $9,121 that he cannot presently afford to repay. These debts\nbecame delinquent during a period when Applicant was continuously employed, and his\npresent financial circumstances do not indicate an ability to resolve them in the near\nterm. His potential for an inheritance remains speculative and uncorroborated.\nSubstantial security concerns are raised under both AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).\n\n6\nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The five\npotentially pertinent conditions are:\n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred\nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast\ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment;\n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business\ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or\nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;\n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is\nunder control;\n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts; and\n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented roof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts arose during the last ten years, and a substantial\nnumber and amount remain delinquent at present. His family budget is such that he\ndoes not have the means to repay them, and is likely to incur additional delinquent debt\nwhen winter utility bills increase. Applicant attributed his financial difficulties to his\ndivorce and alcoholism, but the former was more than eight years ago and his situation\nhas only partially improved since he stopped drinking. Applicant offered no evidence\nthat he either sought or followed financial counseling, or that he has any comprehensive\nplan to address his debt. He has not contacted many of his creditors to arrange\nrepayments despite statements of intent to do so. He said that he disputes the amount\nclaimed on his largest medical debt, but showed no evidence that he followed through\nwith the creditor about that liability. There is insufficient indication in this record that his\nfinancial issues are either under control or likely to improve in the foreseeable future.\nThis evidence establishes minimal mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) through (e). \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nAG \u00b6 30 expresses the security concern pertaining to criminal conduct: \u201cCriminal\nactivity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its\nvery nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws,\nrules and regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern\nand may be disqualifying, including: \u201c(a) a single serious crime or multiple lesser\n\n7\noffenses;\u201d \u201c(c) allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the\nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted;\u201d and \u201c(d) individual is\ncurrently on parole or probation.\u201d\nApplicant\u2019s criminal record spans 25 years and includes multiple violations\ninvolving theft, assault, and violation of traffic laws. His second DUI/DWI offense\noccurred in March 2005, and he will remain on probation under a deferred prosecution\nagreement for that offense for almost two more years. Applicant\u2019s admissions and the\nGovernment\u2019s evidence establish substantial criminal conduct security concerns under\nthese three disqualifying conditions, raising doubt about his judgment and reliability\nwhile also calling into question his ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and\nregulations. \nAG \u00b6 32 provides conditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security\nconcerns:\n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;\n(b) the person was pressured or coerced into committing the act and those\npressures are no longer present in the person's life;\n(c) evidence that the person did not commit the offense; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited\nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or\nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or\nconstructive community involvement.\nApplicant\u2019s last offense was a few months over three years ago, and he has remained\nsober since that incident after successfully completing alcohol treatment. This effort is\ncommendable and establishes a good start toward mitigating security concerns about\nhis judgment, reliability, and willingness to follow the law that are raised by his long\nhistory of criminal acts. The mitigating effect of this recent good behavior is lessened\nsomewhat by the fact that he has been on probation throughout this time, and will\nremain subject to severe sanctions under his deferred prosecution agreement for almost\ntwo more years. Given the extent and duration of his criminal record, it is premature to\nfind that sufficient time has passed to predict that recurrence is unlikely, that doubts\nabout his judgment and reliability are no longer warranted, or that rehabilitation efforts\nhave been fully successful. As noted in the findings section, there is no evidence that\nApplicant committed the offense as alleged in SOR \u00b6 2.b, so that denied allegation is\nconsidered mitigated.\n\n8\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful\nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.    \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s conduct of potential\nconcern involves substantial delinquent debts that he cannot afford to repay, and a\nlengthy history of both financial irresponsibility and criminal conduct of various types\nand degrees of seriousness. Applicant is a mature, experienced adult who is\naccountable for his decisions and conduct. All incidents of security concern arose after\nhe was 25 years old. \nApplicant\u2019s debts arose over a lengthy period, and persist to date. There is\nongoing potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress since he remains\nfinancially overextended. He completed a two-year alcohol treatment program about a\nyear ago, in connection with his deferred prosecution agreement and probation for his\n2005 DUI offense, and has continued to abstain from alcohol to date. This is a\nsubstantial step in the right direction toward rehabilitation, but has so far only occurred\nunder the ongoing threat of deferred prosecution sanctions and probation. It is\npremature to determine that his rehabilitation and behavioral changes are permanent, or\nthat recurrence of financial irresponsibility or criminal behavior is unlikely.\nOn balance, Applicant presented insufficient evidence to mitigate reliability and\ntrustworthiness security concerns arising from his failure to satisfy debts, history of not\nmeeting financial obligations, and lengthy criminal history. Overall, the record evidence\nleaves substantial doubts as to Applicant\u2019s present eligibility and suitability for a security\nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security\nconcerns arising from his financial considerations and criminal conduct. \n\n9\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\n           AGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:                                 Against Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:                                  For Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:                                   Against Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.f:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.g:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance.

On February 8, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns \nunder Guideline F, Financial Considerations, for Applicant. The action was taken under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February \n20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended \n(Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President \non December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for SORs \nissued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nOn April 11, 2008, Applicant answered the SOR and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge. Department Counsel was ready to proceed on May 8, 2008. \nThe case was assigned to another administrative judge on May 19, 2008 and \ntransferred to me on May 21, 2008. On June 12, 2008, a Notice of Hearing was issued, \nscheduling the hearing for July 9, 2008. On July 7, 2008, Applicant requested a delay. \nThe delay was granted and the case was rescheduled for August 5, 2008. The case \nwas heard on that date. The Government offered six exhibits which were admitted as \nSeptember 5, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nGovernment Exhibits (Gov) 1 \u2013 6 without objection. Applicant testified. The record was \nheld open until August 19, 2008, to allow Applicant to submit additional evidence. \nApplicant timely submitted a six-page document that was admitted as AE A without \nobjection. Department Counsel\u2019s response to Applicant\u2019s post-hearing exhibit is marked \nas Hearing Exhibit 1. The transcript was received on August 12, 2008. Based upon a \nreview of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admits to the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, \n1.c, 1.e, 1.f. 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.k, 1.m, and 1.o.

A subsequent background investigation revealed that \nApplicant had 15 delinquent accounts, with a total approximate balance of $30,254. \n(Gov 2; Gov 3; Gov 4; Gov 5; Gov 6.)   \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent accounts include: a $555 delinquent medical account \nplaced for collection in May 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.a: Gov 4 at 2; Gov 6 at 2); a $39 returned \ncheck placed for collection in January 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.b: Gov 4 at 2; Gov 6 at 2); a $482 \ninsurance account placed for collection in January 2007 (SOR \u00b6 1.c; Gov 2 at 6,11; Gov \n3 at 8, 14); a $150 delinquent account placed for collection in August 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.d: \nGov 2 at 7,15; Gov 3 at 15; Gov 4 at 2; Gov 6 at 2); a $112 cable television account \nplaced for collection in August 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.e: Gov 2 at 7, 12; Gov 3 at 15; Gov 4 at \n2); a $213 satellite television account placed for collection in August 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.f: \nGov 2 at 7; Gov 3 at 15); a $112 returned check placed for collection in March 2006 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.g: Gov 2 at 6; Gov 3 at 9); a $210 cell phone account placed for collection in \nApril 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.h: Gov 2 at 6, 12; Gov 3 at 9, 15; Gov 4 at 2; Gov 6 at 2); a $1,966 \ndelinquent account that was charged off in January 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.i: Gov 2 at 6, 13; \nGov 3 at 11; Gov 4 at 2; Gov 6 at 2); a $160 returned check that was charged off in \nDecember 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.j: Gov 2 at 6; Gov 3 at 6; Gov 4 at 3; Gov 6 at 2); a $7,543 \ndelinquent automobile loan that was charged off in June 2004 (SOR \u00b6 1.k: Gov 2 at 13; \nGov 3 at 11; Gov 4 at 3; Gov 6 at 2); a $952 state tax lien entered in January 2004 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.l: Gov 3 at 4-5; Gov 5 at 1); a $5,125 federal tax lien entered on April 1, 2003 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.m: Gov 2 at 6, 9; Gov 3 at 4-6; Gov 4 at 1; Gov 5 at 2; Gov 6 at 1); a $439 \nstate tax lien entered in January 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.n: Gov 2 at 6, 9-10; Gov 3 at 4, 6; Gov \n4 at 1; Gov 5 at 3; Gov 6 at 1); and a $12,196 federal tax lien entered on February 16, \n2001 (SOR \u00b6 1.o: Gov 2 at 6, 10; Gov 3 at 5; Gov 5 at 4). \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began in 2001 with the federal tax lien filed by the \nInternal Revenue Service (I.R.S.). (SOR \u00b6 1.o) His ability to pay his financial obligations \nwas further hindered a result of being laid off from February 2005 to October 2005. \nDuring his period of unemployment, he did some small jobs, but it was not enough to \nmeet his expenses. His wife has been unemployed since 2005. (Tr at 20.) He continued \nto incur delinquent accounts after finding full-time employment. He consulted a credit \ncounselor about seven years ago and considered filing for bankruptcy. He has not \nattended any recent financial counseling. (Tr at 53.) \n \nOf the debts alleged in the SOR, the $7,543 debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k has been \npaid off.  Applicant\u2019s wages were garnished to pay off this debt. (AE A at 4-5; Gov 2 at \n10.) Credit reports indicate the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e (Gov 6 at 2) and SOR \u00b6 1.h \n(Gov 4 at 2; Gov 6 at 2) are paid. The state tax debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and 1.m \nhave been paid. (AE A at 6.) The total balance owed for federal income taxes alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.m and 1.o is now approximately $31,000. Applicant states the I.R.S. has \nplaced the account on hold until he is able to start making payments. He is not able to \narrange a payment plan with the I.R.S. (Tr at 41-42.) Applicant claims the debts alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.h, and 1.j were paid, but provided no proof such as a receipt verifying \npayment. (Tr at 32-33, 35, 39.) He has not paid the remaining debts.  Three weeks prior \nto the hearing, his van was repossessed due to lack of payment. (Tr at 54.)  \n   \nPrior to being laid off in 2005, Applicant earned between $30,000 to $40,000 \nannually. His present salary is $63,000. (Tr at 23.) His monthly take home pay is \napproximately $2,500. He supplements his income with occasional side jobs.  His \nmonthly expenses are approximately $2,800. (Tr at 44-49.)  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \n\n \n4 \n \n \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several disqualifying conditions that could raise security \nconcerns. I find Financial Considerations Disqualifying Condition (FC DC) & 19(a) (an \ninability or unwillingness to satisfy debts); FC DC & 19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations) apply to Applicant\u2019s case. The SOR alleged 15 delinquent debts \ntotaling approximately $30,254.  Of that amount, $18,712 was for delinquent federal and \nstate income taxes.  \n\n \n5 \n \n \n  \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition \n(FC MC) \u00b6 20(a) (the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment) is not applicable. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems continue. Three weeks prior to the hearing, his van was \nrepossessed, which will likely result in a deficiency judgment. Most of the delinquent \ndebts remain unresolved. Applicant currently operates at a negative balance each \nmonth. His expenses are $300 more than his income.       \n \n \nFC MC & 20(b) (the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances) applies, in part, due to the loss of \nApplicant\u2019s job in 2005 and his subsequent nine-month period of unemployment. His \nwife also lost her job in 2005 and has not worked since that time.  However, this \nmitigating condition cannot be fully applied because Applicant has taken minimal steps \ntowards resolving his delinquent accounts once he obtained full-time employment in \nFebruary 2007. It cannot be concluded that he acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances with regards to resolving his delinquent accounts.     \n \nFC MC \u00b6 20(c) (the person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol) does not apply. Applicant attended financial counseling approximately seven \nyears ago and did not attempt to attend recent financial counseling. Although the debt in \nSOR \u00b6 1.k was paid by garnishing Applicant\u2019s wages, and the state tax debts alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l and 1.n are resolved, the remaining delinquent accounts remain unresolved. \nHis federal income tax debt has increased to $31,000. His financial problems are not \nlikely to be resolved in the near future.  \n \nFC MC & 20(d) (the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts) applies, with respect to the debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.e, 1.h, 1.k, 1.l, and 1.n. However, Applicant has not met his burden of proof \npertaining to the resolution of the other debts in the SOR.  He took minimal action \ntowards resolving these accounts. \n \nGuideline F is decided against Applicant.  \n \n  \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \n\n \n6 \n \n \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant provided no information \nabout his work history. I considered Applicant\u2019s period of unemployment since 2005,  \nand his efforts to resolve some of the accounts. However, the majority of the delinquent \naccounts remain unresolved. Applicant\u2019s outstanding federal tax debt has increased to \n$31,000. His van was recently repossessed. Applicant\u2019s budgetary information provided \nat hearing reveals that his expenses are greater than his income. It is too soon to \nconclude Applicant has mitigated the concerns raised under financial considerations. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to \nmitigate the security concerns arising under financial considerations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.e:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.f:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.g:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.h:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.i:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.k:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.m:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.n:  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.o:  \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On November \n29, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of \nReasons (SOR) to him, pursuant to Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended and modified; and \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended and modified (Directive). \nThe SOR alleged security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations), and \ndetailed reasons why DOHA could not make a preliminary affirmative finding under the \nDirective that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue a \nsecurity clearance for Applicant, and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge \nto determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked.  \n \nJune 3, 2008\n\n \n2 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nIt should be noted that on December 29, 2005, the President promulgated \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility For Access to Classified \nInformation, and on August 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) \npublished a memorandum directing implementation of those revised Adjudicative \nGuidelines (hereinafter AG) for all adjudications and other determinations made under \nthe Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel \nSecurity Program (January 1987), as amended and modified (Regulation), in which the \nSOR was issued on or after September 1, 2006.  The AG are applicable to Applicant\u2019s \ncase because his SOR was issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 21, 2007. In a sworn, \nwritten statement, dated January 3, 2008, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations \nand requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. Department Counsel indicated \nthe Government was prepared to proceed on January 23, 2008, and the case was \nassigned to Administrative Judge Henry Lazzaro on January 25, 2008. It was \nreassigned to me on February 14, 2008, due to caseload considerations. A Notice of \nHearing was issued on February 19, 2008, and I convened the hearing, as scheduled, \non March 19, 2008. \n \nDuring the hearing, five Government exhibits were received without objection. \nApplicant testified, but offered no exhibits. The transcript of the hearing (Tr.) was \nreceived on March 28, 2008.  The record remained open until April 8, 2008, to enable \nApplicant to furnish documents to support his contentions, and eight documents were \ntimely submitted and received without objection. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answers to the SOR, Applicant admitted three of the factual allegations in \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.j., 1.i., and 1.n. of the SOR.  He denied all other allegations.  \n \nApplicant is a 43-year-old employee of a defense contractor, and he is seeking to \nobtain a security clearance, the level of which has not been divulged.  He was \npreviously granted a SECRET clearance in July 2002.1  He was married to his first wife \nfrom 1987 until 2002, and married his current spouse in 2004. His wife has two children, \nand he has one daughter, not with his first wife, born in November 1992. \n \nFrom May 1999 until the present, Applicant has been gainfully employed by \ndefense contractors as either an electrician or industrial electrician.2 Applicant\u2019s \nfinances were apparently unremarkable until about 1991. From the Government\u2019s \nviewpoint, thereafter, he apparently periodically experienced financial difficulties which \nresulted in accounts becoming delinquent and being \u201ccharged off\u201d and/or placed for \ncollection. Federal tax liens were placed against his property on several occasions, and \nhis wages were garnished because of child support arrearage. \n \n1 Government Exhibit 2 (Letter to Defense Industrial Security Clearance Office (DISCO) from Facility \nSecurity Officer, dated Oct. 6, 2005). \n \n2 Government Exhibit 1 (Security Clearance Application, dated Mar. 3, 2006), at  2. \n \n\n \n3 \n                                      \n \n \nThe SOR identified fourteen purportedly continuing delinquencies, but Applicant \ncontends several of the allegations are duplicates of others; several have been satisfied \nor otherwise resolved; and some were not his responsibility. His contentions have merit.  \nThe evidence and information offered by the Government consists of two credit reports \nand written and oral statements made by Applicant.  The same statements, along with \nofficial court records, were offered in support of Applicant\u2019s case. The fourteen debts \nlisted in the SOR, and their respective purported current status, according to the Credit \nReports, dated November 20, 2007 (the most current one in evidence), and November \n15, 2006, as well as Applicant\u2019s comments regarding same, are described below: \n \nSOR \u00b6 \nTYPE DEBT \nAMOUNT \nSTATUS \n1.a. \nauto loan reassigned Sep 2005 \n$13,515.00 \nvoluntary repossession \nto original creditor - 1st \npayment ($150.00 per \nmonth) Mar 2008 \n1.b. \nmedical (original creditor unknown)  \n(possibly for his daughter) \n$562.00 \ncollection 2005 -unpaid \n1.c. \nmedical (original creditor unknown) \n(possibly for his daughter) \n$109.00 \ncollection May 2004 \u2013\nunpaid debt of ex-wife \n1.d. \nmedical (original creditor unknown) \n$133.00 \ncollection Oct 2006 -\nunpaid \n1.e. \nmedical (original creditor unknown) \n$37.00 \ncollection Dec 2005 -\nunpaid \n1.f. \nmedical (original creditor of acct \nreferred to in SOR \u00b6 1.c.) \n$109.00 \ncollection Oct 2003 \u2013\nunpaid debt of ex-wife \n1.g. \nIRS tax lien  \n$1,135.96  \nlien filed Aug 1991 & \nreleased Aug 1992 \n1.h. \nIRS tax lien \n$1,049.63  \nlien filed Feb 1992 & \nreleased Apr 1992 \n1.i. \nIRS tax lien \n$1,532.69 \nlien filed Feb 1991 & \nreleased May 1991 \n1.j. \nauto loan from original creditor (acct \ntransferred to creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a.) \n$14,419.00 \nvoluntary repossession \n\u2013 acct transferred \n1.k. \ncredit card \n$1,178.00 \ncharged off $1,178.00 \non acct with credit limit \nof $511.00 \u2013 $1,200.00 \npaid off 2000-01 \n1.l. \nchecking account and credit card \n$520.00 \ncollection Sep 2003 \u2013 \nzero \nbalance, \nbut \nApplicant \nfailed \nto \ndispute \nwithin \ntime \nframe required \n1.m. \nauto insurance \n$368.00 \ncollection Apr 2002 \u2013\ninitial creditor has no \nrecord of deficiency \n1.n. \nwage garnishment for child support \n& child support arrearage \n$334.00 \n& \n$50.00 \nbiweekly \nvoluntary garnishment \n\u2013 arrearage satisfied \n \n\n \n4 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.j. refer to both the original creditor and the subsequently \nassigned collection agent, as conceded by Department Counsel.3 A cursory review of \nthe November 2006 Credit Report leaves no doubt as to that conclusion,4 and including \nboth credit report entries as separate allegations in the SOR provides some notice of \nwhere the account was transferred, but also tends to inflate the perception of financial \nirresponsibility. The account(s) pertain to a used automobile for which Applicant could \nnot maintain payments,5 so he voluntarily relinquished the vehicle to the creditor.6  \nWhile he did not make payments for a substantial period, he eventually entered into a \npayment plan with the collection agent and, as of February 2008, agreed to make \nmonthly payments of $150.00, with the first payment in March 2008.7 \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. through 1.f. refer to medical charges from largely unidentified \n(referred to in the November 2006 Credit Report as \u201cunknown\u201d) creditors.8 Applicant \ndenied they were incurred by him or any member of his immediate family, and surmised \nthey might have been incurred by his ex-wife on behalf of their daughter.9  In that event, \nthey are not his responsibility but that of his ex-wife who was the custodial parent.10 \nOne of the potential creditors, a medical provider not fully identified in SOR \u00b6 1.f., was \napproached by Applicant, and Applicant was informed that the balance of $109.00 was \nnot his account but that of his daughter.11 The account referred to in SOR \u00b6 1.d. is \nalleged to have been placed for collection in October 2006, and it appears in the \nNovember 2007 Credit Report,12 but not in the November 2006 Credit Report.  There \nare no statements of account or other evidence supporting the allegations. \n \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g. through 1.i. refer to delinquent balances owed, as of November \n2006, on federal tax liens filed against Applicant by the IRS, without further information \npertaining to dates or reasons.  The information upon which the SOR allegations was \nbased was derived from the November 2006 Credit Report.13  The credit report does \nnot identify the dates the liens were placed, or the current status of each such lien.

Applicant denied being \nindebted to the IRS and contended he has always paid his federal income tax.14  In his \nAnswer to the SOR, he indicated that he was told by the IRS that no such liens \nexisted.15 \n \nPertaining to SOR \u00b6 1.g., a notice of federal tax lien was issued in August 1991, \nbased on an unpaid balance of assessment totaling $1,135.96.16 However, that lien was \nreleased by the IRS in August 1992,17 well before the credit reports were created or the \nSOR was written.  Pertaining to SOR \u00b6 1.h., a notice of federal tax lien was issued in \nFebruary 1992, based on an unpaid balance of assessment totaling $1,049.63.18 \nHowever, that lien was released by the IRS in April 1992,19 also well before the credit \nreports were created or the SOR was written.  Pertaining to SOR \u00b6 1.i., a notice of \nfederal tax lien was issued in February 1991, based on an unpaid balance of \nassessment totaling $1,532.69.20 However, that lien was released by the IRS in May \n1991,21 also well before the credit reports were created or the SOR was written.  In fact, \nnone of those federal tax liens should have still remained in the November 2006 Credit \nReport as they antedate the credit report by more than seven years.22  A thorough \ninvestigation and review of the public records, as well as more accurate and reliable \ncredit information gathering and reporting would have established those facts. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.k. refers to a credit card account, opened in September 2000, which \npurportedly had a credit limit of $500.00, resulting in a \u201ccharge-off\u201d of $1,178.00.  The \nNovember 2006 Credit Report lists the account twice.  One reference is to the credit \nlimit of $500.00, the high credit of $511.00, and a zero balance. That account was \nsupposedly \u201ctransferred or sold\u201d, with the balance charged-off in July 2001.23 \nSubstantially the same information appears in the November 2007 Credit Report.24 The \nsecond reference is to an account opened in September 2000, with a credit limit of \n \n14 Tr. at 24-25, 38-41. \n \n15 Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, supra note 10, at 1. \n \n16 Applicant Exhibit A (Notice of Federal Tax Lien Under Internal Revenue Laws, dated Aug. 19, 1991). \n \n17 Applicant Exhibit B (Certificate of Release of Federal Tax Lien, dated Aug. 14, 1992). \n \n18 Applicant Exhibit E (Notice of Federal Tax Lien Under Internal Revenue Laws, dated Feb. 20, 1992). \n \n19 Applicant Exhibit F (Certificate of Release of Federal Tax Lien, dated Apr. 2, 1992). \n \n20 Applicant Exhibit C (Notice of Federal Tax Lien Under Internal Revenue Laws, dated Feb. 7, 1991). \n \n21 Applicant Exhibit D (Certificate of Release of Federal Tax Lien, dated May. 16, 1991). \n \n22 Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), \u00a7 605(a)(3), 15 USC \u00a71681c. \n \n23 Government Exhibit 5, supra note 4, at 7. \n \n24 Government Exhibit 4, supra note 12, at 2. \n \n\n \n6 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \n$511.00, and a zero balance.25  The November 2006 Credit Report reflects $1,178.00 \nbeing charged-off in March 2002.26  There is no mention of the larger amount in the \nmore recent credit report. \n \nApplicant disputed the existence of any outstanding balance and contends he put \nmoney in his sister\u2019s account every month and, pursuant to an agreement with a \ncollection attorney, she made the payments by check, in the amount of $207.00, until \nthe account was paid off during 2000-01.27  He attempted to locate the checks but was \nunable to do so, and sought to confirm the current zero status of the account with the \noriginal creditor, but the creditor could find no information regarding the account.28 \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.l. refers to a credit card affiliated with a checking account, opened in the \nlate 1990s, which was placed for collection in September 2003. The November 2006 \nCredit Report refers to the account,29 but the November 2007 Credit Report does not \nmention it.  Applicant disputed the existence of an outstanding balance and contends \nthere had been a dispute over the balance several years ago, but the dispute was \nsupposedly resolved (when the creditor\u2019s computer system was down) and he was \nnotified of a zero balance.30 He thought nothing further about the account until he was \ninformed by DOHA that it was still a current issue.  He followed up on the matter and \nspoke with the original creditor who informed him that there was no record that his initial \ndispute was made within the allowed timeframe, so at the time he was informed of the \nzero balance the account had already been forwarded for collection.31 He attempted to \nsettle the account with the original creditor but was told nothing could be done with it \nand that he would have to deal with the unspecified and unidentified collection agent.32 \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.m. refers to an automobile insurance account purportedly placed for \ncollection in April 2002.  The November 2006 Credit Report refers to the account, and \nindicates the $368.00 balance was placed for collection in April 2002,33 but the \nNovember 2007 Credit Report does not mention it.

He contends that his efforts to determine the validity of the \ndelinquency resulted in the creditor advising him they could find no account in his name \nand no balance owed.35 \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.n. refers to the wage garnishment for child support and child support \narrearage.  As written, the allegation infers an involuntary garnishment of wages in the \nbiweekly amounts of $334.00 (for child support) and $50.00 (for child support \narrearage). In fact, the garnishment was the result of a \u201cVoluntary Income Deduction \nAgreement\u201d as reported to DISCO in October 2005.36  Prior to that action, Applicant had \nbeen making \u201cinformal\u201d monthly child support payments to the child\u2019s mother in the \namount of $300.00, plus extras as needed.37  He contends the arrangement worked \nsatisfactorily until the child\u2019s mother found out about his pending relationship with his \nnew wife-to-be.38  At that point she went to court.  As a result, Applicant was determined \nto be in arrears in the amount of $2,640.00 and the support payments were \nformalized.39 His child support arrearage has been paid in full, and his child support \naccount is current.40 \n \nApplicant borrowed money from his 401(k) to pay off the majority of his bills, and \nis now current in all other obligations.  He remains within a budget,41 and generally has \na monthly balance of about $1,694.68 in discretionary funds available for his use.42 \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nAn Administrative Judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nAdministrative Judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \n \n35 Id. at 50. \n \n36 Government Exhibit 2, supra note 1. \n \n37 Tr. at 52. \n \n38 Id. at 52-53. \n \n39 Applicant Exhibit G (Final Judgment, dated Sep. 15, 2005). \n \n40 Applicant\u2019s Answer to SOR, supra note 10, at 2. \n \n41 Government Exhibit 3 (Personal Financial Statement, undated, attached to Answers to Interrogatories         \nsupra note 28; Tr. at 56. \n \n42 Id. \n\n \n8 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of \na number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge \nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \n \nSince the protection of the national security is the paramount consideration, AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d43 The Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish \na potentially disqualifying condition under the Directive. Once the Government has \nproduced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \nthe Applicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, \nexplanation, extenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the \nGovernment\u2019s case.  The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as \nwell. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to \nrepose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants \naccess to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d Accordingly, nothing in this Decision should be construed to \nsuggest that I have based this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied \ndetermination as to Applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \n43 \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, \n2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \n\n \n9 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. . . . \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly, under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Also, AG & 19(g), \u201cfailure to file annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns as required or the fraudulent filing of same\u201d may raise security \nconcerns as well. Applicant\u2019s admissions and submissions establish evidence to \nsubstantiate SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. (and the corresponding 1.j.), 1.l., and 1.n., as well as 1.g. \nthrough 1.i., 1.k., 1.l., and 1.n. The Government evidence, along with Applicant\u2019s \ndenials, fails to establish sufficient evidence to substantiate the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. \nthrough 1.f., or 1.m. as Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts.  \n \nThe Government attributes substantial importance and credibility to entries in the \ntwo credit reports in evidence. I have reviewed them, and even with extensive \nexperience in deciphering the entries, found them to be garbled and internally \ninconsistent, with minimum indicia of reliability.  There is no indication as to the \nsource(s) of the information appearing therein, for as the Equifax Credit Report states, \nthe entries are derived from \u201cpublic records or other information\u201d without identifying the \n\u201cother information.\u201d44 It provides even less information about the sources of the \nderogatory financial information.  The combined report does not disclose even that \nmuch information. \n \nAs noted, the credit reports contain duplicate entries seemingly reflecting one \naccount opened by a creditor and another by a collection agent; information which is not \nverified as accurate; information which may not apply to Applicant; information which is \nincomplete or not current; and information which appears in one report but not in the \nother. Thus, the factual or legal accuracy, currency, or reliability of the information is left \nto mere speculation. Accordingly, I find they are unreliable and untrustworthy, and in \nthis particular instance, inaccurate as well.  In the absence of creditor statements of \naccount or other more reliable, accurate, and trustworthy evidence, including Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions, I decline to accept as accurate and trustworthy allegations in credit reports \nchallenged or contradicted by Applicant\u2019s denials. \n \nApplicant did experience an inability to keep up with the payments on his \nautomobile and, in 2005, offered it back to the creditor as a voluntary repossession.  His \ndelay until 2008 in commencing to make payments on the remaining balance \nconstitutes a history of not meeting financial obligations. The disputes regarding child \n \n44 Government Exhibit 4, supra note 12, at 1. \n\n \n10 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \nsupport arrearage and the \u201cuntimely\u201d disputed checking account, both fall within a \npurported history of not meeting financial obligations. The above actions are sufficient to \nraise these potentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.  \n \nHowever, the issue pertaining to the federal tax liens is a different matter.  The \nfederal tax liens were filed against Applicant by the IRS in 1991-92, but there is no \ndescribed basis for those filings, and with Applicant\u2019s denials to the allegations and \ncontentions that he had filed his income tax returns, there is no evidence to establish a \nfailure by Applicant to file annual income tax returns as required in AG & 19(g).  \nMoreover, two of those liens were released within three months of being filed, and the \nremaining lien was released within 12 months. There is no evidence to substantiate the \nallegations that delinquent balances remain as of November 2006 as a result of these \nliens. Furthermore, legally, they should not currently appear in his credit report. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition \nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s \n2005 inability to make his monthly automobile payments, and the absence of repayment \narrangements until 2008, is the single most potentially troublesome issue. The child \nsupport arrearage, when considering the circumstances at the time, with Applicant \ninformally paying child support but disappointing the mother of his child, and the \nensuing court action, is not as troublesome. Neither of these circumstances currently \nexists. I find the behavior is unlikely to recur, and it does not raise concerns about his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. I find AG \u00b6 20(a) applies in this \ncase.  \n \nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@ \nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). In this instance, the first section of AG & 20(c) \nis not in issue for there is no evidence of Applicant having received counseling for \nfinancial issues. However, there are clear indications that his financial issues have been \nresolved or are under control.  Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows \nAthe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise \nresolve debts.@45 Applicant generally has a monthly balance of about $1,694.68 in \n \n45 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant must present \nevidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or some other good-faith \naction aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires a showing that a person \nacts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d \nAccordingly, an applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \n\u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition].  \n \n\n \n11 \n                                      \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                          \ndiscretionary funds available for his use. He previously satisfied the child support \narrearage and is now current in his child support payments. He previously voluntarily \nrelinquished his automobile to the creditor and has now entered into a payment \narrangement to satisfy the remaining balance. His actions in addressing his debts \nindicate good-faith efforts on his part as well as showing clear indications the problem is \nnow largely under control.  I find AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) apply in this case. \n \nUnder AG & 20(e), financial security concerns may be mitigated where Athe \nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is \nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of \nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions taken to resolve the issue.\u201d  As noted above, \nApplicant followed up on the remaining accounts set forth in the SOR allegations and \ndetermined there were zero balances, or the accounts were not his, or he could not \nidentify the creditors.  He has provided written statements and testimony describing his \nactions and the result of those actions. I have considered his oral and written \nstatements and examined his demeanor, and consider him to be candid, truthful, and \ncredible.  He acted responsibly in identifying and eventually resolving his debts. I find \nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies in this case.  \n \nThe Government appears concerned that Applicant purportedly permitted his \ncredit card (SOR \u00b6 1.k.), checking account (SOR \u00b6 1.l.), and auto insurance account \n(SOR \u00b6 1.m.) to be either \u201ccharged-off\u201d46 or sent to collection.  Applicant has disputed or \nexplained those actions.  It appears the debts were never reduced to judgments.  In \neach case, the creditors located in Florida, merely charged the delinquent balances off \nor sent the accounts to collection in 2000-03. While the credit reports may reflect the \nbalances as delinquent, as of the date of the hearing in March 2008, it appears the \ndebts are barred by Florida\u2019s 5-year statute of limitations,47 making them legally \nuncollectible.48  Applicant is financially sound and prepared for future contingencies.  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case \nNo. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n \n46 It is commonly acknowledged that a \u201ccharge off\u201d is a practice where the creditor gives up on collection \nefforts, takes a tax write-off on the debt, and/or sells the debt to a third party.  The debt still exists, but the creditor has \nreceived a tax benefit and possibly sold the debt to the third party.  The debt may or may not be legally collectible.  \n  \n47 See Fla. Stat. \u00a7 95.11(2)(b) (2007) (written obligation; five years).   \n \n48 The South Carolina Court of Appeals succinctly explained the societal and judicial value of application of \nthe statute of limitations: \n \nStatutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that they stimulate activity, \npunish negligence and promote repose by giving security and stability to human affairs.  The \ncornerstone policy consideration underlying statutes of limitations is the laudable goal of law to \npromote and achieve finality in litigation.  Significantly, statutes of limitations provide potential \ndefendants with certainty that after a set period of time, they will not be ha[iled] into court to defend \ntime-barred claims.  Moreover, limitations periods discourage plaintiffs from sitting on their rights.  \nStatutes of limitations are, indeed, fundamental to our judicial system. \n  \n \nCarolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 363 S.C. 169, 175-76, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 (S.C. Ct. App. 2005) (internal \nquotation marks and citations omitted). \n \n\n \n12 \n                                      \n \n                                                          \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has taken affirmative \naction and made substantial good-faith efforts to pay off or resolve his legitimate \ndelinquent debts, including those raising security concerns. (See AG & 2(a)(6).) While it \nis the Government\u2019s contentions that he still has outstanding debts identified in the \nSOR, those debts were never reduced to judgments and the Statute of Limitations for \neach of the debts has expired, making them uncollectible. (See AG & 2(a)(8).) Thus, \nthese debts cannot be sources of improper pressure or duress. \n \nOf course, the issue is not simply whether all his debts are resolved; it is whether \nhis financial circumstances raise concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. \nI am mindful that while any one factor, considered in isolation, might put Applicant\u2019s \ncredit history in a sympathetic light, I have evaluated the various aspects of this case in \nlight of the totality of the record evidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal \nanalysis.49 Considering his continuing good-faith efforts, the circumstances behind \nsome of the debts, the nature of some of the legitimate debts, and the \ninappropriateness of some of the debts listed in the credit reports, his past financial \nsituation is insufficient to raise continuing security concerns. (See AG & 2(a)(1).)   \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.  \n \n49 See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. \nBd.

Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted her security clearance application on August 21, 2006. On \nFebruary 7, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny her \napplication, citing security concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The \naction was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on February 13, 2008; answered it \non March 3, 2008; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA \nreceived the request on March 6, 2008. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed \non April 7, 2008, and the case was assigned to me on the same day. DOHA issued a \nnotice of hearing on April 17, 2008, scheduling the hearing for May 21, 2008. I \nconvened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 10 were \nJune 30, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nadmitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified on her own behalf and \nsubmitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through DD, which were admitted without \nobjection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until June 6, 2008, to \nenable her to submit additional evidence.  Applicant timely submitted AX EE through II, \nand they were admitted without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s response to AX EE \nthrough II is attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit I. DOHA received the transcript of \nthe hearing (Tr.) on June 5, 2008. The record closed on June 6, 2008. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is granted. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR, \nexcept SOR \u00b6 1.f, which she denied. Her admissions in her answer to the SOR and at \nthe hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. I make the following findings: \n \n \nApplicant is a 55-year-old senior software engineer for a federal contractor. She \nhas worked for her current employer since June 2006. She began working for federal \ncontractors in 1978, worked her way through school, and became a software engineer \nin 1999 (Tr. 51). She has worked for several federal contractors and held a clearance \nfrom March 1992 until about three years ago, when it was administratively terminated \nbecause she moved to a job that did not require a clearance (Tr. 9). \n \n \nApplicant is highly regarded by her friends, co-workers, and supervisors. Her \nfriends describe her as reliable, honest, dedicated, capable, hard-working, and \ndependable (AX X, Z, AA, and DD). Co-workers similarly describe her as having a zest \nfor learning. She is considered affable, reliable, honest, conscientious, and dependable \n(AX Y and BB). Former supervisors evaluated her as trustworthy, hardworking, \nconscientious, and dependable (AX W, BB and CC).  \n \n \nApplicant was married in June 1971 and divorced in July 1975. She remarried in \nDecember 1975 and was divorced in February 1983, remarried in November 1990 and \ndivorced in November 1991. She married her fourth husband in September 1998, and \nthey divorced in May 1999. She married her fourth husband again in September 2000, \nand they divorced in June 2005. After her divorce in June 2005, she assumed most of \nthe marital debts from her most recent marriage (Tr. 27).  \n \n \nWhen Applicant was divorced in June 2005, her ex-husband agreed to assume \nthe credit card debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, and his agreement was spelled out in the \ndivorce decree (Enclosure to Answer to SOR). The debt has been resolved (AX E, F, \nand FF).  \n \n \nApplicant entered into a debt settlement program in November 2005 to resolve \nher debts after her last divorce. The total unsecured debt was about $28,210, and her \nplan provided for eliminating the debt in 36 months (GX 1 at 39). She made monthly \npayments of $210 beginning in November 2005. The three large debts alleged in SOR \n\n \n3 \n \n \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c and 1.d were not included in her debt settlement program, but she \nnegotiated separate payment agreements with those creditors. \n \n \nApplicant purchased a manufactured home in August 1997 and lived there with \nher spouse until October 1999 when her office relocated in another state (Tr. 52). \nRenters occupied the home until October 2000, when Applicant accepted a job in her \nhome state and resumed living in the manufactured home. She and her spouse incurred \nabout $6,000 in credit card debt to repair the renters\u2019 damage (GX 6 at 1). \n \nApplicant and her spouse purchased another house in January 2001, but were \nunable to sell the manufactured home. In July 2002, Applicant left her job because the \ncompany started laying off employees and she believed she would be laid off soon. She \nincurred the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b when she left her job after less than one year \nand was required to reimburse her employer for training (Tr. 54-55). She learned about \nthe debt a couple of years ago when a collection agency contacted her (Tr. 55-56). She \nrecently negotiated a payment plan and has made payments of $100 per month \nbeginning in April 2008 (Tr. 56; AX R, S, T, and U). \n \nApplicant found a job in another state, and she purchased a house at her new job \nlocation, hoping to sell the other two properties. In mid-2002, Applicant and her spouse \nwere unable to make all their loan payments. Renters had again damaged the \nmanufactured home, and they decided to allow the loan company to repossess it. This \ndebt is alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. Applicant negotiated a payment plan, paid a lump sum of \n$4,000, and has been paying $400 per month since January 2008 (Answer to SOR; AX \nJ through Q). \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d is a credit card account. It is the same debt as \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f (AX G). While Applicant worked in another state, she and her \nspouse maintained two households and used credit cards for airline tickets to visit each \nother and to repair damage to their rental property. All the loans and credit cards were \nin Applicant\u2019s name because her spouse had bad credit. (Tr. 61-62; GX 6 at 1). \nApplicant negotiated a payment plan and has made seven $500 payments on this debt \n(Tr. 62; Answer to SOR; AX H, I, and II)  \n \n \nThe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e was for a line of credit with a credit union. \nApplicant stopped making payments in December 2005 when she entered the debt \nsettlement program (Tr. 67). In April 2008, she used her income tax refund to pay off \nthis debt as well as the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h. (Tr. 69; AX B, C, and D). The credit card debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g was paid in full in 2007 (Answer to SOR; Tr. 69-70; AX A). \n \n \nApplicant sold one of her two remaining homes in the summer of 2004. She \nbecame the sole owner of the one remaining home, which is currently occupied by \nrenters while she works in another location (GX 6 at 2). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s net monthly income in June 2007 was about $4,620, her household \nexpenses were $2,423, and her debt payments were $2,177 (GX 6). She submitted an \n\n \n4 \n \n \nupdated financial statement after the hearing, reflecting net monthly income of \n$6,121.94, expenses of $2,982, debt payments of $3,042, and a net remainder of \n$117.94 (AX GG). At the time of the hearing, she was preparing to move to a smaller, \nless expensive apartment at the end of her lease (Tr. 29). After the hearing, she \nsubmitted a financial statement reflecting that her monthly rent and utilities in the new \napartment would be about reduced by about $600 (AX HH). \n \n \nThe evidence concerning the debts alleged in the SOR is summarized in the \ntable below. \n \nSOR Debt \nAmount \nStatus at Hearing \nEvidence \n1.a \nCredit card \n$5,504 \nSettled Apr. 2008 \nAnswer to SOR; AX E, F, FF \n1.b \nTraining \nprogram \n$7,048 \nPays $100 monthly \nsince Apr. 2008 \nAX R through U \n1.c \nRepossession\n$36,615 \nPays $400 monthly \nsince Jan. 2008 \nAnswer to SOR; AX J-Q \n1.d \nCredit card \n$35,262 \nPays $500 monthly \nsince Oct. 2007 \nAnswer to SOR; AX H, I, II \n1.e \nLine of credit \n$2,686 \nPaid Apr. 2008 \nAX B, C \n1.f \nCredit card \n$24,860 \nSame debt as 1.d \nAX G \n1.g \nCredit card \n$2,017 \nPaid 2007 \nAnswer to SOR; Tr. 69-70; AX \nA \n1.h \nCollection \n$408 \nPaid Apr. 2008 \nAX D \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \n\n \n5 \n \n \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n \nSeveral disqualifying conditions under this guideline could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying in this case. AG \u00b6 19(a) is raised where there is an \n\n \n6 \n \n \nAinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts.@ AG \u00b6 19(b) is a two-pronged condition that is \nraised where there is Aindebtedness caused by frivolous or irresponsible spending and \nthe absence of any evidence of willingness or intent to pay the debt or establish a \nrealistic plan to pay the debt.@ AG \u00b6 19(c) is raised when there is Aa history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.@ AG \u00b6 19(e) is raised when there is Aconsistent spending \nbeyond one=s means, which may be indicated by excessive indebtedness, significant \nnegative cash flow, high debt-to-income ratio, and/or other financial analysis.@ \nApplicant\u2019s financial history raises AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (c), and (e). AG \u00b6 19(b) is not raised \nbecause there is no evidence of \u201cfrivolous or irresponsible spending.\u201d \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), (b), (c) and (e), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An \napplicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving \nit never shifts to the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, \n2005).  \n \nSecurity concerns based on financial problems can be mitigated by showing that \nAthe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual=s \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ AG \u00b6 20(a). This is a compound \nmitigating condition, with three disjunctive prongs and one conjunctive prong.  It may be \nestablished by showing the conduct was Aso long ago,@ or Aso infrequent,@ or Aoccurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur.@  If any of the three disjunctive \nprongs are established, the mitigating condition is not fully established unless the \nconduct Adoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment.\u201d \n \nThe first two prongs (\u201cso long ago\u201d and \u201cso infrequent\u201d) are not established \nbecause Applicant incurred numerous delinquent debts, three of them were resolved \nonly recently, and the recently negotiated payment plans for the three debts are not yet \ncompleted. The third prong (\u201cunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\u201d) is \nestablished. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts were caused by unwise purchases of multiple \nhomes and the expense of maintaining two households while working at a location \ndistant from where her spouse resided. Applicant is resolving the debt incurred when \nher manufactured home was repossessed. She is divorced, now owns only one home \nthat is generating rental income, and earns a substantial income that is more than \nadequate to satisfy her financial obligations.  \n \nThe fourth prong (\u201cdoes not cast doubt\u201d) also is established. Applicant held a \nsecurity clearance for many years, apparently without incident. She is well respected by \nher friends, co-workers, and supervisors. She had no financial problems until about \n2002. She responded to the debts alleged in the SOR decisively and responsibly. I \nconclude AG \u00b6 20(a) is established. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person=s \ncontrol (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, unexpected medical \nemergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances.@ AG \u00b6 20(b). Both prongs, i.e. conditions beyond the \npersons=s control and responsible conduct, must be established. Applicant\u2019s first job \nrelocation in October 1999 was a circumstance beyond her control, but her second job \nrelocation to avoid a layoff was voluntary, albeit prudent. The damage to her \nmanufactured home by renters was beyond her control. Her divorce was a circumstance \nbeyond her control, but the debts had already occurred by this time, and she had \nvoluntarily put all debts in her name because of her spouse\u2019s bad credit record. Her \ndecision to purchase two additional homes was voluntary. Since 2002, she has acted \nresponsibly in resolving her financial problems. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(b) applies only to \nher involuntary move in October 1999. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nperson has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or is under control.@ AG \u00b6 20(c). This \nmitigating condition also has two prongs that may be either disjunctive or conjunctive. If \nthe person has received counseling, it must also be shown that there are clear \nindications the problem is being resolved or under control. However, if the person has \nnot received counseling, this mitigating condition may still apply if there are clear \nindications that the problem is being resolved or under control. \n \nApplicant sought financial counseling in November 2005. She negotiated \nseparate payment plans for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d, because they \nwere not included in her debt settlement plan. She has sufficient income to make the \npayments on her debts and has done so. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(c) is established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing that Athe \nindividual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve \ndebts.@ AG \u00b6 20(d). The concept of good faith Arequires a showing that a person acts in \na way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or \nobligation.@ ISCR Case No. 99-0201, 1999 WL 1442346 at *4 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 1999). \nEvidence of past irresponsibility is not mitigated by payment of debts only under \npressure of qualifying for a security clearance.   \n \nApplicant began working on her financial situation in November 2005, long before \nthe SOR was issued. She paid the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g in 2007. She negotiated a \npayment plan for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d in October 2007. She negotiated a \npayment plan for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c in January 2008. In April 2008, she used \nher income tax refund to pay the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e and 1.h., and she \nnegotiated payment plans for the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(d) is \nestablished. \n \n\n \n8 \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigating by showing Athe \nindividual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is \nthe cause of the problem and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of \nthe dispute or provides evidence of actions to resolve the issue.@ AG \u00b6 20(e). Applicant \ndisputed the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f and provided documentary evidence that it was a \nduplicate of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d. I conclude AG \u00b6 20(e) is established with \nrespect to SOR \u00b6 1.f. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a mature adult who has spent virtually all of her career as a \ngovernment contractor. She and her former spouse made some unwise financial \ndecisions while they were living separately because of her job. She had no financial \nproblems before 2002. After her divorce in June 2005, she addressed her financial \nsituation aggressively, and her financial situation is under control. She lives frugally and \nhas a good income. She was candid, sincere, and credible at the hearing. \n \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and \nevaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the security concerns based on financial considerations. Accordingly, I \nconclude she has carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n9 \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nLeRoy F.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 37-year old woman with two children, ages 15 and 13. She has been married since 2006. This is her second marriage. Her first marriage, to the father of her children, lasted from 1992 to 2003. She has a high school diploma and has taken a semester of college courses. Applicant works as a financial assistant for a defense contractor. She is highly respected on the job and in her community.

Edmunds, Esquire\nFor Applicant: Pro se\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nCURRY, Marc E., Administrative Judge:\nOn February 28, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its denial of Applicant\u2019s\nrequest for a security clearance. Specifically, it alleged facts which raise concerns under\nGuidelines F, Financial Considerations, and E, Personal Conduct. The action was taken\nunder Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry\n(February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense\nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as\namended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the\nPresident on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense for\nSORs issued after September 1, 2006. \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 14, 2008, and requested a hearing. I was\nassigned the case on April 29, 2008. On April 30, 2008, the hearing was scheduled for\nMay 20, 2008. At the hearing, I received four government exhibits, 11 Applicant exhibits,\nand the testimony of three Applicant witnesses The transcript (Tr.) was received on\nJune 27, 2008\n\n2\nJune 11, 2008. Upon reviewing the record evidence, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s\napplication for eligibility to hold a security clearance is granted.\nPreliminary Ruling\nAt the close of the record, Department Counsel acknowledged that Applicant had\nmitigated the government\u2019s Guideline E security concern (Tr. 58), as alleged in\nParagraph 2. I have resolved Paragraph 2 in Applicant\u2019s favor, and will not address it\nfurther in the Decision.\nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 37-year old woman with two children, ages 15 and 13. She has\nbeen married since 2006. This is her second marriage. Her first marriage, to the father\nof her children, lasted from 1992 to 2003. She has a high school diploma and has taken\na semester of college courses.\nApplicant works as a financial assistant for a defense contractor. She is highly\nrespected on the job and in her community. A coworker describes her as a\n\u201cconscientious and reliable employee,\u201d (Exhibit C), and a friend describes her as a\n\u201chardworking, generous, and a trustworthy citizen\u201d (Exhibit E). \nApplicant\u2019s credit reports reflect approximately $17,600 of delinquent debt.\nApproximately $15,000 originated from charges that her first husband incurred (SOR\nsubparagraphs 1.a through 1.g). He was a spendthrift who seldom worked on a steady\nbasis, and repeatedly accrued debt that he failed to satisfy. After the first time her\nhusband accrued delinquencies on their joint credit cards, she successfully obtained a\nconsolidation loan and, by the late 1990s, had satisfied it (Answer at 2). \nThen, without Applicant\u2019s knowledge, her first husband opened credit card\naccounts, either in her name or both of their names, concealed the bills, and used them\nto finance an extra-marital affair (Exhibit 2 at 4; Tr. 17). In approximately 2001,\nApplicant discovered these debts, left her husband, and filed for divorce.\nIn May 2003, the divorce was finalized (Exhibit K). The court granted custody of\nthe children to Applicant, and ordered her husband to pay $215 in weekly child support\n(Exhibit K at 2). The court also stated as follows:\nThe parties have divided the marital property and debt to their own\nsatisfaction. Each of the parties shall keep such property as they now\nhave in their possession. Each of the parties shall be responsible for the\ncredit card debts that exist in their respective names (Id. at 3).\nAfter the divorce was finalized, Applicant continued to discover credit card\naccounts that her ex-husband had opened without her knowledge (Answer at 2). Also,\nshe began receiving phone calls from collection agents. When she tried to direct them\n\n3\nto her ex-husband, the creditors told her that she was ultimately responsible because\nthey were in her name (Tr. 17). Applicant then confronted her ex-husband. He refused\nto pay them (Id.). She then entered consumer credit counseling in late 2003 and\ndeveloped a payment plan for her debts (Answer at 2).\nApplicant\u2019s ex-husband\u2019s child support payments grew increasingly sporadic,\nrendering her unable to adhere to the credit counselor\u2019s payment plan. After six months,\nshe abandoned it. She has made no further effort to pay these delinquencies or contact\nthe creditors (Tr. 23). All of these debts have delinquent since 2001.\nApproximately $2,200 of the SOR delinquencies constitute Applicant\u2019s children\u2019s\nmedical bills accrued after the 2003 divorce (SOR subparagraphs 1.h through 1.t). Both\nchildren have behavioral and/or medical disorders requiring costly treatment (Tr. 35-36).\nHer insurance covers the children\u2019s health care. The delinquencies are amounts that\nexceeded the yearly deductibles. She contends that the medical bills are her ex-\nhusband\u2019s responsibility. She contacted the collection agent for the medical collection\nagency listed in subparagraphs 1.h through 1.k to dispute the bills, and to give the\nagency her ex-husband\u2019s contact information (Exhibit I). When she locates him, her\nintention is to compel him to pay for her these bills. Her efforts at contacting him have\nthus far been unsuccessful.\nShe did not contact the collection agent for the remaining medical bills (SOR\nsubparagraphs 1.l through 1.t) because she thought all of them were being managed by\nthe collection agency listed in SOR subparagraphs 1.h to 1.k (Tr. 23). \nApproximately $400 of the debt listed in the SOR is a credit card account\naccrued after the divorce (subparagraph 1.u). Applicant is in the process of contacting\nthe creditor. Excluding this debt and the medical debts, which she disputes, she is\ncurrent on all of her other expenses and debts, including her monthly rent payments and\nher car note (Tr. 27-28; Exhibit 3).\nHer ex-husband is approximately $18,700 behind in child support payments\n(Exhibit H). His whereabouts are unknown. Applicant, with the help of the local social\nservices agency that manages the child support payments, is trying to locate him and\ngarnish his wages (Tr. 33; Answer at 2). He continues to change jobs frequently,\nmoving from state to state.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\n\n4\nThe administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and\ncommon sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a scrutiny of a\nnumber of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge\nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present,\nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nUnder this guideline, \u201cfailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts,\nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about\nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information (AG\n\u00b6 18). Here, Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of AG \u00b6\u00b6\n19(a), \u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19( c), \u201ca history of not meeting\nfinancial obligations.\u201d\nNearly all of Applicant\u2019s debt constitute either bills her ex-husband accrued\nsurreptitiously, or her children\u2019s medical bills. During Applicant\u2019s first marriage, her ex-\nhusband repeatedly abused the family finances. The first time he burdened Applicant\nwith credit card debt, she obtained a consolidation loan, and gradually satisfied it. After\nher ex-husband\u2019s second episode of reckless overspending, she divorced him, and\ndemanded that he pay the delinquencies. When he refused, she attempted to satisfy the\ndebts again, but failed primarily because of financial difficulties caused by her ex-\nhusband failure to pay court-ordered child support. AG \u00b6 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that\nresulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of\nemployment, a business downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce\nor separation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances,\u201d and AG \u00b6\n20(d), \u201c the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise\nresolve debts,\u201d apply.\n\n5\nAG \u00b6 20(b) also applies to Applicant\u2019s medical delinquencies. Her children have\nseveral medical and/or behavioral disorders that require costly treatment. She contends\nthese bills, as copayments that exceeded her health insurance deductible, are her ex-\nhusband\u2019s responsibility. She has been diligently pursuing court action to modify the\nchild support order to compel him to satisfy them.\nUnder the state law where she resides, the custodial parent is required to pay\ncopayments up to $250 per year (Exhibit K). The court has the discretion to divide any\nmedical expenses exceeding this amount between the custodial and the non-custodial\nparent (Id. at 7). Given the years Applicant has spent raising her children with minimal\nfinancial support from her ex-husband, and the applicable state law governing non-\ncustodial parents and their children\u2019s medical expenses, AG \u00b6 20(e), \u201cthe individual has\na reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the past-due debt which is the cause of\nthe problem, and provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or\nprovides evidence of actions to resolve the issue,\u201d also applies to Applicant\u2019s medical\ndelinquencies.\nSOR subparagraph 1.u is the only bill that does not relate to Applicant\u2019s failed\nfirst marriage and her ongoing problems with receiving steady child support. Given its\nminimal amount and the fact that she is current on major debts such as her rent and her\ncar payment, I conclude it has minimal security significance.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an\napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.\nApplicant\u2019s financial delinquencies were caused almost entirely by her ex-\nhusband who used their credit cards to, among other things, finance an extramarital\naffair. Her efforts at satisfying these debts, five year ago, were sidetracked by her\nhusband\u2019s failure to pay child support. Consequently, any negative security inference\n\n6\nagainst Applicant from not satisfying these debts is negated by the circumstances\nsurrounding their accrual.\nAll of the credit card delinquencies excluding subparagraph 1.u have been in\ndelinquent status since 2001. Applicant\u2019s state of residence has a statute of limitations\nbarring creditors from collecting debts that have been delinquent more than six years\n(See State Code Ann. \u00a744-501). Consequently, she has no legal obligation to pay them,\nand no corresponding vulnerability to coercion. Typically, in ISCR cases, the tolling of a\nstatute of limitations has no bearing on an applicant\u2019s security clearance-worthiness,\nbecause the analysis is focused on the conduct and/or deficient judgment that\ngenerated the debt. Here, the Applicant generated little, if any, of the credit card\ndelinquencies. \nApplicant is currently financially stable. She is engaged in an ongoing effort to\nlocate her ex-husband and compel him through court to pay delinquent child support,\nand to pay the delinquent medical copayments. She has sought the help of the state\nchild support enforcement agency.\nUpon considering all of the disqualifying and mitigating conditions together with\nthe whole person factors, I conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interest\nto grant Applicant access to classified information. Clearance is granted.\nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.u:\nFor Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nFOR APPLICANT\nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n                                             \n_________________\nMARC E. CURRY\nAdministrative Judge\n",

On February 12, 2008, the Defense Office of\nHearings and Appeals (DOHA), pursuant to Executive Order 10865 (as amended), and\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992, issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to the Applicant, which detailed the reasons why DOHA\ncould not make the preliminary affirmative finding under the Directive that it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant and recommended referral to an Administrative Judge to determine whether a\nclearance should be denied or revoked.  \nThe Applicant responded to the SOR on March 14, 2008, and he requested a\nhearing before a DOHA Administrative Judge.  This case was assigned to the\nundersigned on April 29, 2008.  A notice of hearing was issued on May 2, 2008, and the\nhearing was scheduled for May 28, 2008.  At the hearing the Government presented\nseven exhibits, referred to as Government Exhibits 1 through 7.  The Applicant\npresented four exhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through D.  He also\ntestified on his own behalf.  The official transcript (Tr.) was received on June 5, 2008.\n\n2\nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on the Applicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR,\nthe testimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 48 years old and has an Associates of\nArts Degree in Electrical Engineering.  He is employed by a defense contractor as a\nQuality Engineer and is seeking to obtain a security clearance in connection with his\nemployment.  \nThe Government opposes the Applicant's request for a security clearance, on the\nbasis of allegations set forth in the Statement of Reasons (SOR).  After a complete and\nthorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of the same,\nthe following findings of fact are entered as to each paragraph and guideline in the\nSOR:\nParagraph 1 (Guideline F - Financial Considerations)  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for a security clearance because he is financially overextended\nand at risk to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth in the SOR under this\nguideline.  He is indebted to four separate creditors totalling approximately $ 20,888.00.\nCredit reports of the Applicant dated March 17, 2007, August 29, 2007, April 28, 2008\nand May 28, 2008, reflect each of these delinquent debts.  (Government Exhibits 4, 5, 6\nand 7).  The Applicant indicates that after researching the state Code of Civil Procedure\non his own, he believes that he no longer owes the debts and has no intent to pay them.\n(Government Exhibit 3).  He states that, \u201cWithin four years, an action upon a contract,\nobligation, liability, founded upon an instrument in writing provided in Section 336(a) of\nthe Code\u201d, basically releases him from liability for the accounts or debts.  (Tr. p. 23).\nHowever, if he at some point determines that he is liable for the debts, he will pay them.\nDue to periods of financial hardship: when his employment fluctuated up and\ndown, and overtime was unexpectedly cut back, and when his daughter and niece\ndefaulted on car loans that the Applicant had co-signed, the Applicant was unable to\npay all of his debts and some of his debts became delinquent.  He had to make hard\ndecisions, to use his income to support his family instead of paying his bills.  \nA debt owed to First Premiere in the amount of $500.00 remains outstanding.\nAlthough the Applicant never had this credit card, his wife did, and they may have had a\njoint account.  The Applicant recently contacted the creditor who told him that there was\nno record of the debt.  However, the debt is reflected on the Applicant\u2019s most recent\ncredit report dated May 28, 2008.  He states that he is currently disputing the debt with\nall three credit agencies.  (Applicant Exhibit D).  \nA debt to Americredit in the amount of $5,696.00 for an account that was\ncharged off in August 2002 remains owing.  Another debt to Americredit in the amount\nof $4,567.00 for an account charged off in September 2002 remains owing.  A debt to\nBalboa Thrift in the amount of $10,125.00 for an account charged off in February 2003\n\n3\nremains owing.  The Applicant explained that on three separate occasions, three\nvehicles that he had purchased were voluntarily repossessed because he could no\nlonger afford to make the payments.  On one of those occasions he had co-signed on\nthe loan for his daughter, on another, he had co-signed for his niece.  The Applicant is\ndisputing all three car repossession debts with the credit agencies and was told that\nthey will continue on his record until April 2009.  (Applicant Exhibit D). \nThe Government requested that the debt set forth in allegation 1(e) be withdrawn\nand presented no evidence to support the allegation.  Accordingly allegation 1(e) is\nfound for the Applicant.             \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E - Personal Conduct).  The Government alleges that the\nApplicant is ineligible for clearance because he intentionally falsified material aspects of\nhis personal background during the clearance screening process.\nThe Applicant admits each of the allegations set forth under this guideline.  (See\nApplicant\u2019s Addendum to Answer to SOR/Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D).  The Applicant\ncompleted an Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) dated\nMarch 2, 2007.  Section 28 (a) asked him if in the last 7 years, has he been over 180\ndays delinquent on any debts.  The Applicant responded, \u201cNO\u201d.  (Government Exhibit\n1).  This was a false answer.  Question 28(b) of the same application asked him if he\nwas currently over 90 days delinquent on any debts.  The Applicant again answered,\n\u201cNO\u201d.  (Government Exhibit 1).  This was also a false answer.  The Applicant stated that\nhe should have answered \u201cYES\u201d to both questions but because they were old debts, he\ndid not feel that they could be used against him.  He now realizes that he should have\nbeen more forthcoming.  He stated that he would never jeopardize the national secrets. \nPerformance Appraisals of the Applicant for 2007-2008 reflect that his overall\nwork performance \u201cexceeds performance requirements\u201d.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C). \nHe states that there is nothing in his background that could be used to blackmail\nor coerce him into improperly providing proprietary or classified information.  He had a\nDoD clearance with a NATO attachment at a prior company for 16 years and\nunderstands the serious nature of safeguarding classified information.  He loves his\nfamily, country and the company he works for, and would never jeopardize that\nstanding.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit D).\n\n4\nPOLICIES\nEnclosure 2 of the Directive sets forth adjudication policies divided into \"Disqualifying\nFactors\" and \"Mitigating Factors.\"  The following Disqualifying Factors and Mitigating\nFactors are found to be applicable in this case:\nGuideline F (Financial Considerations)\n18.  The Concern.  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information.  An individual who\nis financially overextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial crimes including\nespionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a\nsecurity concern.  It may indicate proceeds from financially profitable criminal acts.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n19.(a)  inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts;\n19.\u00a9\n a history of not meeting financial obligations.\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct)\n15.  The Concern.  Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor,\ndishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified\ninformation.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful and candid answers\nduring the security clearance process or any other failure to cooperate with the security\nclearance process.\nConditions that could raise a security concern:\n16.  (a) Deliberate omission, concealment or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used\nto conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or\nstatus, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities.\n\n5\nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\nNone.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17,  in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \nI.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\nan acceptable security risk.  Eligibility for access to classified information is predicted\nupon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The adjudicative\nprocess is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the whole person\nconcept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable\nand unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination.\u201d The Administrative\nJudge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have reasonable and logical\nbasis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw inferences or conclusions\nbased on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in nature.  Finally, as emphasized\nby President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order\n. . . shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a\ndetermination as to the loyalty of the Applicant concerned.\u201d\n\n6\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn the defense industry, a security clearance is entrusted to civilian workers who\nmust be counted upon to safeguard such sensitive information twenty-four hours per\nday, seven days per week.  The Government is therefore appropriately concerned when\navailable information indicates that an Applicant for such access may be involved in\ninstances of financial irresponsibility which demonstrates poor judgment or unreliability.\nIt is the Government\u2019s responsibility to present substantial evidence to support\nthe finding of a nexus, or rational connection, between the Applicant\u2019s conduct and the\nholding of a security clearance.  If such a case has been established, the burden then\nshifts to the Applicant to go forward with evidence in rebuttal, explanation or mitigation\nwhich is sufficient to overcome or outweigh the Government\u2019s case.  The Applicant\nbears the ultimate burden of persuasion in proving that it is clearly consistent with the\nnational interest to grant him a security clearance.\nIn this case the Government has met its initial burden of proving that the\nApplicant has been financially irresponsible (Guideline F) and has falsified material facts\non his security clearance application (Guideline E).  This evidence indicates poor\njudgment, unreliability and untrustworthiness on the part of the Applicant.  Because of\nthe scope and nature of the Applicant's conduct, I conclude there is a nexus or\nconnection with his security clearance eligibility.\nThe evidence shows that the Applicant has over extended himself financially on\nmore than one occasion.  As a result, he has fallen short in paying his debts.  Now, he\nasserts that the state Code of Civil Procedure gives him the ability to walk away from\nthe debts without paying them.  The Government asserts that the state Code of Civil\nProcedure does not apply in this case.  Whether or not the Civil Code allows the\nApplicant the ability to walk away from his debts because they are old, under state law,\nis not relevant here.  The ultimate decision here is whether the Applicant has\ndemonstrated a willingness to satisfy his debts, and shown a history of meeting his\nfinancial obligations.  Clearly, he has not.  The Applicant has ignored his delinquent\ndebts and remains indebted in the amount of approximately $ 20,000.00. \nUpon review of his financial report, it appears that he has little in disposable\nincome at the end of the month to pay his delinquent bills.  Under Guideline F (Financial\nConsiderations), Disqualifying Conditions 19(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy\ndebts, and 19\u00a9 a history of not meeting financial obligations are applicable.  None of the\nmitigating conditions apply.  His financial problems remain current, they are not isolated,\nand the Applicant has not initiated a prompt, good faith effort to repay his overdue\ncreditors or otherwise resolve his debts. \nI have also considered the \u201cwhole person concept\u201d in evaluating the Applicant\u2019s\neligibility for access to classified information.  Under the particular facts of this case, the\ntotality of the conduct set forth under all of the guidelines viewed as a whole, support a\nwhole person assessment of questionable judgement, untrustworthiness, unreliability,\n\n7\nlack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other\ncharacteristics indicating that the person may not properly safeguard classified\ninformation.  The Applicant has not even begun the process of financial rehabilitation\nand he has a long way to go before his financial affairs are in order.    \nIn addition, the Applicant intentionally failed to answer questions 28(a) and 28(b)\naccurately on his Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing.  He\ndeliberately failed to acknowledge his delinquent debts in response to the questions\nbecause he did not believe that they could be held over him.  It was not the Applicant\u2019s\nplace to make the determination as to whether the delinquent debts could be held over\nhim, he was simply to answer the questions truthfully, which he did not do.  Under\nGuideline E (Personal Conduct), Disqualifying Conditions 16(a) Deliberate omission,\nconcealment or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security questionnaire,\npersonal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance\neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities applies.  None of the\nmitigating conditions are applicable.  Accordingly, I find that the Applicant intentionally\nsought to conceal material information from the Government on his security clearance\napplication.\n    \nThis Applicant has not demonstrated that he is trustworthy, and does not meet\nthe eligibility requirements for access to classified information.  Accordingly, I find\nagainst the Applicant under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E\n(Personal Conduct).  \nOn balance, it is concluded that the Applicant has failed to overcome the\nGovernment's case opposing his request for a security clearance.  Accordingly, the\nevidence supports a finding against the Applicant as to the factual and conclusionary\nallegations expressed in Paragraph 1 and 2 of the Government's Statement of Reasons.\n   \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.c.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.d.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  1.e.:\nFor the Applicant.\nParagraph 2: Against the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.a.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n    Subpara.  2.b.:\nAgainst the Applicant.\n\n8\nDECISION\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\n  Darlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n",

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel\nFOR APPLICANT\nPro Se\n\n2\nThe Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) proposed to deny or revoke access to\nautomated information systems in ADP-I/II/III sensitivity positions for Applicant.  On July 15, 2008,\nDOHA issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that\ndecision\u2014trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive).  Applicant\nrequested a hearing.  On January 29, 2009, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Edward W.\nLoughran denied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness determination.  Applicant appealed\npursuant to the Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30.\nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision is arbitrary,\ncapricious, or contrary to law.\nSpecifically, Applicant contends that the Judge did not give adequate weight to the mitigating\nevidence which he presented.\nThe Judge made the following pertinent findings of fact:  Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties\nstarted in about 2003.  He was unemployed for three months and then accepted a position in another\ncity 200 miles away.  His wife was working on her doctorate and was unable to go with him.  The\ncouple purchased a recreational vehicle for Applicant to live in at his job location while his wife\nremained in their home.  The cost of maintaining two households had an adverse impact on their\nfinances.  Added to this burden were the facts that his wife had medical problems that prevented her\nfrom working, the couple had two elderly parents who became ill and passed away, and they had\ndamage to their house from a natural disaster.\nApplicant\u2019s finances were further damaged by his wife\u2019s spending habits.  Applicant stated\nthat he is personally responsible for only about 5% of their debt.  Applicant\u2019s wife was working on\nattaining a doctorate degree, and she spent money on the prospect of higher future income.  She\nnever earned the doctorate and never obtained the higher-paying job.  One of Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s\ncurrent expenditures is the leasing of a 2008 luxury automobile at the rate of $656 per month.\nApplicant testified that the lease arrangement was made without his knowledge.\nApplicant and his wife filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy on January 3, 2009.  On Schedule D\nof the filing, the couple listed the following creditors holding secured claims: the mortgage on his\nhouse, the loans for his car and recreational vehicle, and the leased car.  On Schedule F, listing\ncreditors holding unsecured nonpriority claims, the couple listed 24 creditors and debts totaling\n$271,029.  The Chapter 13 repayment plan called for 60 monthly payments of $1,000 beginning in\nFebruary 2009.  The plan has not been approved by the bankruptcy court.  Applicant and his wife\nreceived counseling by internet and telephone pursuant to his bankruptcy. \nOnce the government presents evidence raising trustworthiness concerns, the burden shifts\nto the applicant to establish mitigation.  The presence of some mitigating evidence does not alone\ncompel the Judge to make a favorable trustworthiness determination.  As the trier of fact, the Judge\nhas to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether the favorable evidence outweighs the\nunfavorable evidence, or vice versa.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-06553 at 2 (App. Bd. April 30,\n\nEven though the lease was undertaken without Applicant\u2019s knowledge, it demonstrated that Applicant\u2019s\n1\nfinances were not under control.\nOn April 15, 2009, the Appeal Board received a fax from Applicant indicating that his bankruptcy petition has\n2\nnow been approved.  The Board is unable to consider this new evidence.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  Even if the Board\nwere to consider it, it would not change the fact that Applicant has not established a track record of payments under the\nplan.\n3\n2008).  An applicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue\nfor a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the\nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See,\ne.g., ISCR Case No. 06-17409 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2007).\nIn this case, Applicant contends that the Judge should have found his financial situation to\nbe mitigated because his wife was responsible for the accrual of 95 per cent of their debt.  He also\nmaintains that the debt is no longer a security concern since he has filed for bankruptcy.  In\nconsidering the application of the relevant mitigating conditions, the Judge discussed Applicant\u2019s\nfinancial situation.  The Judge stated that Applicant was aware of his financial difficulties when he\nspoke to an investigator in March 2007.  At that time, Applicant told the investigator that he intended\nto resolve his delinquent debts either by entering into a debt consolidation plan or by filing for\nChapter 13 bankruptcy.  The Judge noted that the 2008 luxury car lease was undertaken on behalf\nof Applicant\u2019s wife after that time.   Moreover, the Judge indicated that the bankruptcy plan\n1\nproposed by Applicant had not been approved at the time of the hearing.   Thus, the Judge concluded\n2\nit was \u201cstill far too early in the bankruptcy process to alleviate concerns about his finances.\u201d\nDecision at 7.  \n   \nAfter reviewing the record, the Board concludes that the Judge examined the relevant data\nand articulated a satisfactory explanation for his decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between\nthe facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d  Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

Given the extent of Applicant\u2019s financial problems and the relative\npaucity of mitigation evidence, the Judge\u2019s unfavorable trustworthiness determination is sustainable.\nOrder\nThe Judge\u2019s unfavorable trustworthiness determination is AFFIRMED.\nSigned: Jean E. Smallin               \nJean E. Smallin\nAdministrative Judge\nMember, Appeal Board\n\nThe Judge\u2019s mentioning of the statement of Applicant is problematic in that the Judge is merely referencing\n1\nthe testimony of Applicant, but stops short of making a specific finding of fact concerning the percentage of overall debt\nthat may be attributed to Applicant\u2019s wife. Notwithstanding this, there is nothing in the decision to suggest the Judge\nrejected Applicant\u2019s characterization of the apportionment of responsibility of debt between him and his wife.  The\nreferencing of Applicant\u2019s statement at least indicates the Judge\u2019s awareness, in his findings of fact, that the actions of\nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2013as opposed to Applicant\u2013were a significant factor in the case. \n4\nSigned: James E. Moody               \nJames E. Moody\nAdministrative Judge\nMember, Appeal Board\nSeparate Opinion of Administrative Judge Jeffrey D. Billett, Dissenting\nI would remand this case to the Judge below.  I perceive a significant disconnect between the\nJudge\u2019s findings of fact and his conclusions, and it is my judgment that he has not addressed an\nimportant aspect of the case.  My detailed reasons follow.\nApplicant complains that in the Judge\u2019s decision there is no distinction between the actions\nof his wife in incurring debt and his own actions in incurring debt, and that the Judge has wrongly\nattributed to him the financial actions and behaviors of his wife.  While Applicant acknowledges that\nattribution of his wife\u2019s debts to him may be appropriate in a strictly legal sense, he asserts that in\nevaluating him for a trustworthiness position, the government should be concerned with his actions\n(or absence thereof) concerning the generation of those debts.  In support of his position, Applicant\npoints to the following items in the record: (i) a letter from Applicant\u2019s wife, dated January 12, 2009\nin which she states that it was her actions and her medical problems that caused the couple\u2019s\nfinancial situation; (ii) his wife leased a 2008 luxury car during the same period Applicant was\ndriving a 1994 Chevy Cavalier, which evidenced his commitment to responsible spending on items\nhe could control; and (iii) Applicant lived in a recreational vehicle while working in a city away from\nhis home to spend as little as practical on duplicate living expenses.  I find Applicant\u2019s argument\nmeritorious.\nIn his findings of fact, the Judge appears to recognize that the spending habits of Applicant\u2019s\nwife were a significant contributing factor to Applicant\u2019s financial predicament.  Indeed, the Judge\nnotes that Applicant stated that he is personally responsible for only about 5% of the total debt.   The\n1\nJudge also referenced Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s practice of spending in anticipation of future income.  In\nhis conclusions section, however, the Judge does not comment upon the portion of the debt that is\nattributable to Applicant\u2019s wife, nor does he comment upon the wife\u2019s role in the debt accumulation.\nHe merely states that Applicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unwilling or\nunable to satisfy them for a period of time.  The Judge also asserted that Applicant\u2019s financial\nproblems were extensive.  While the Judge does make a single, general reference to the joint debt\naccrued by Applicant and his wife, every other reference in the conclusions section is to Applicant\n\nThere is an additional reference to the leasing of the 2008 car on behalf of the wife, but no indication from the\n2\nJudge as to who was responsible for the lease.  Record evidence indicates that the lease was arranged by the couple\u2019s\nson, and the evidence raises the possibility that Applicant was unaware, at least initially, of the arrangement. \n5\nand Applicant\u2019s debt alone.   An overall reading of the Judge\u2019s conclusions section indicates to me\n2\nthat the Judge is laying the responsibility for the overall amount of debt upon Applicant without any\ndetailed comments or analysis as to why Applicant is responsible for a sizable amount of debt that\nhe did not personally acquire.  Because there is no discussion in the conclusions section regarding\nthe damage to Applicant\u2019s finances attributable to his wife and how this factor impacts upon\nApplicant\u2019s trustworthiness, there is a significant disconnect between the findings of fact and the\nconclusions portions of the Judge\u2019s decision.   \nA Judge is not required to discuss every piece of evidence in the record before him.\nNevertheless, it is error to fail to discuss and/or analyze an important aspect of the case. Faced with\nevidence (Applicant\u2019s hearing testimony that only about 5% of the outstanding debt is attributable\nhis actions coupled with a written statement of the wife stating her role in running up the couple\u2019s\ndebt) that Applicant\u2019s debt problems may be largely attributable to his wife, it was incumbent upon\nthe Judge to specifically address and analyze the issue of Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s actions in the\nconclusions section of his decision and to indicate the effect, if any, of the wife\u2019s actions on the\nultimate trustworthiness determination in the case.  \nI would remand the case to the Judge for correction of these errors.\nSigned: Jeffrey D. Billett                  \nJeffrey D. Billett\nAdministrative Judge\nMember, Appeal Board\n",

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); Department of \nDefense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program, dated January 1987, \nas amended (Regulation); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by \nthe President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the Department of Defense \nfor SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on October 3, 2008 and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on December 9, \n2008. DOHA issued a Notice of Hearing on December 19, 2008, and the hearing was \nconvened as scheduled on January 7, 2009. The Government offered Exhibits (GE) 1 \nthrough 4, which were received without objections. Applicant testified on his own behalf, \nJanuary 29, 2009\n\n2 \ncalled one witness, and submitted Exhibits (AE) A through E, which were received \nwithout objections. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open to submit \nadditional information. Applicant submitted 13 pages of documents, which were marked \nAE F through K, and admitted without objections. Department Counsel\u2019s memo is \nmarked Hearing Exhibit (HE) I. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nJanuary 26, 2009.  \n \nProcedural Rulings \n \nI advised Applicant of his right under \u00b6 E3.1.8 of the Directive to 15 days notice \nbefore the hearing. Applicant affirmatively waived his right to 15 days notice.   \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has an \nassociate\u2019s degree. He has been married for more than 30 years and has one adult \nson.1 \n \n \nThe SOR lists 11 delinquent debts totaling about $193,271. Applicant admitted to \nall the SOR allegations, except for SOR \u00b6 1.a, which is a debt for $125. He stated that \nthis debt \u201cwas incorrectly reported to the credit bureau, but is such a small amount that \nno attempt was made to correct it.\u201d The debt is listed on the credit report of February 6, \n2008.2  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties started in about 2003. His company closed their \noffice in his city and he was unemployed for about three months. He accepted a similar \nposition with the same company in another city about 200 miles away. His wife was \nworking in their home city on a research project necessary to complete her doctorate \nand was unable to relocate to the new city. They purchased a recreational vehicle for \nApplicant to live in his new city while his wife remained in their home. The cost of \nmaintaining two households had an adverse impact on their finances. His wife also had \nnumerous medical problems and she was unable to work. Applicant and his wife both \nhad an elderly parent who became ill and passed away. They also had damage to their \nhouse from a natural disaster.3  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s finances were further damaged by his wife\u2019s spending habits. \nApplicant stated that he is personally responsible for only about 5% of their debt. She \nwas working on attaining a doctoral degree. She was told by professors and others that \nshe would be capable of earning a very large salary once she had her doctorate and \nshe spent money on the prospect of future income. She never obtained the doctorate \n                                                          \n1 Tr. at 25, 53; GE 1. \n \n2 Tr. at 30-31; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 4. \n \n3 Tr. at 28, 32, 39-42, 46-47; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2. \n \n\n3 \nand never obtained the high paying job. She indicated that she has learned from this \nexperience and will not make the same financial mistakes again.4  \n \n \nApplicant was questioned by an investigator from the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) on March 14, 2007, and fully discussed his finances. His finances \nwere already in total disarray by that point. He indicated that he intended to resolve his \ndelinquent debts either by a debt consolidation plan or by filing Chapter 13 bankruptcy.5  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s son works for a car dealer. He was able to lease a 2008 luxury car for \nhis mother at a rate of $656 per month. She pays her son who makes the monthly \npayments. Applicant testified that this was done without his knowledge.6 \n \n \nApplicant filed a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in January 3, 2009. Under Schedule D \u2013 \nCreditors Holding Secured Claims, he listed the mortgage on his house, the loans for \nhis car and recreational vehicle, and the leased car. Schedule F \u2013 Creditors Holding \nUnsecured Nonpriority Claims listed 24 creditors and debts totaling $271,029. Schedule \nF includes all the debts in the SOR, except for the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.f \nwhich total $30,304. Applicant realized after the hearing that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.d was not included in the schedule. He indicated he called his bankruptcy attorney \nabout the omission and was waiting a response. He incorrectly stated that the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f was included in Schedule F. His proposed plan called for 60 \nmonthly payments of $1,000 beginning in February 2009. Of the projected $60,000 in \npayments, $3,570 would go to the Trustee, $2,085 to his bankruptcy attorney, $46,836 \nto the loan for his recreational vehicle, and $7,508 to his unsecured creditors. The plan \nhas not been approved by the bankruptcy court. Applicant and his wife received \ncounseling by internet and telephone pursuant to his bankruptcy.7  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s supervisor testified that Applicant is honest, reliable, trustworthy, and \nthat he has good work ethics and is a valuable member of their team.8 \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for \n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \n                                                          \n4 Tr. at 26-28, 37, 48-50, 54; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2; AE H. \n \n5 GE 2. \n \n6 Tr. at 43-45; AE C. \n \n7 Tr. at 52-56; AE A-E, I, J.  \n \n8 Tr. at 22-23. \n \n\n4 \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \nand Office of Personnel Management. Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable trustworthiness \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n \n Section 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n \n\n5 \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18:       \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n \n \nApplicant accumulated a number of delinquent debts and was unable or unwilling \nto pay his obligations for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand (c).  \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem \nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control;  \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n\n6 \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are extensive. He is still in the process of resolving \nhis debts. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable at this time.  \n \n \nApplicant was laid off work and had to relocate to another city. His wife could not \nmove because of her education. She had numerous medical problems and was unable \nto work. They both had parents who became very sick and passed away. Their home \nwas damaged by a natural disaster. These are all conditions that were largely beyond \nhis control. To be fully applicable, AG \u00b6 20(b) also requires that the individual act \nresponsibly under the circumstances. While these circumstances clearly hampered his \nfinancial situation, the circumstances are not fully accountable for the overwhelming \ndebt accrued by Applicant and his wife. Applicant told the OPM investigator in March \n2007, that he intended to resolve his delinquent debts either by a debt consolidation \nplan or by filing Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Since then a 2008 luxury car was leased on \nbehalf of his wife. He has recently filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy. His proposed payment \nplan, which has not been approved by the court, calls for him to pay $60,000 over five \nyears. Only $7,508 of that amount will be used to pay the $271,029 listed as owed to his \nunsecured creditors. Two of the debts in the SOR totaling $30,304 are not listed in the \nschedule. There is insufficient information for a finding that Applicant has acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. Applicant receives partial consideration under AG \n\u00b6 20(b).  \n \nApplicant received financial counseling pursuant to his bankruptcy. He has \nsubmitted a Chapter 13 bankruptcy plan that has not been approved and he has not \nstarted on the repayment of the debts. The process is not sufficiently advanced at this \ntime for a finding that there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved. AG \n\u00b6 20(c) is partially applicable. His actions are not yet sufficient to qualify as a good-faith \neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.9 AG \u00b6 20(d) is not \napplicable. \n \nApplicant disputed owing the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a. The debt is listed on the credit \nreport of February 6, 2008. Applicant did not provide documentation in support of the \ndispute. AG \u00b6 20(e) is not applicable. \n \n \n                                                          \n9 The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \nIn order to qualify for application of Financial Considerations Mitigating Condition 6, an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The \nDirective does not define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the \nconcept of good-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows \nreasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, \nan applicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available \noption (such as bankruptcy) in order to claim the benefit of Financial Considerations \nMitigating Condition 6.  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No.  99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)). \n\n7 \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a public \ntrust position must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has an overwhelming \namount of unsecured delinquent debt. Unforeseen events contributed to his financial \nproblems, but clearly not to this extent. I considered his favorable work record, but he is \nstill far too early in the bankruptcy process to alleviate concerns about his finances.  \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the trustworthiness concerns arising from his \nfinancial history.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.k: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n8 \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \npublic trust position. Eligibility for access to sensitive information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nEdward W.

On March 26, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to him,1 pursuant to Executive \nOrder 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information Within Industry, dated February 20, \n1960, as amended and modified, and Department of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense \nIndustrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), dated January 2, \n1992, as amended, modified and revised.

On August 19, 2008, the case was assigned to me. At the \nhearing held on September 18, 2008, Department Counsel offered six exhibits (GEs 1-\n6) (Transcript (Tr.) 18-19), and Applicant did not offer any exhibits (Tr. 9-10). There \nwere no objections, and I admitted GE 1-6 (Tr. 19). Additionally, I admitted the SOR, \nresponse to the SOR and Hearing Notice (GE 7-9). I received the transcript on \nSeptember 25, 2008.   \n \nFindings of Fact3 \n \nApplicant admitted responsibility for all financial problems listed in the SOR with \nexplanations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a to 1.l). His admissions are incorporated herein as findings of \nfact. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence of record, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact.   \n \nApplicant is 43 years old (Tr. 5, 43).4 He graduated from high school and then \nattended a technical school in electronics, achieving the equivalent of an associate\u2019s \ndegree (Tr. 5). He does not hold a clearance (Tr. 6). Applicant was married from 1986 to \n1996 (Tr. 20). He had two children during this marriage (Tr. 20-21). His marriage ended \nin an acrimonious divorce (Tr. 15). Applicant remarried in January 2002 and has a four-\nyear-old son and a 14-year-old step son from his current marriage (Tr. 35).   \n \nApplicant held a good job for 19 years, and had an annual salary of about \n$60,000 (GE 3 at 3). In late 2002, he moved to a different state to be closer to his \ndaughter, who was living with Applicant\u2019s former spouse (Tr. 15-16, 24, 30, GE 3 at 3).5 \nHis income was reduced by over half because he left his high-paying job to live near his \ndaughter, who needed his support (Tr. 52, G3 at 3). He eventually obtained custody of \n \n2On Aug. 30, 2006, the Under Secretary of Defense (Intelligence) published a memorandum \ndirecting application of revised Adjudicative Guideline to all adjudications and other determinations made \nunder the Directive and Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, Personnel Security Program \n(Regulation), dated Jan. 1987, as amended, in which the SOR was issued on or after Sep. 1, 2006. The \nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines are applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. \n \n3Some details have not been included in order to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits. GE 9 (Response to SOR) is the source for the facts in this \nsection unless stated otherwise.   \n  \n4GE 1 (2007 security clearance application) is the source for the facts in this paragraph, unless \nstated otherwise. \n \n5There was no objection, and I approved admission of Applicant\u2019s opening statement as \nsubstantive evidence (Tr. 20). \n\n \n \n3 \n \nhis daughter; however, his former spouse retained custody of Applicant\u2019s son (Tr. 28, \n30). In October 2006, his former spouse obtained a contempt citation because Applicant \nwas allegedly $6,800 behind in paying his child support (Tr. 28, 34). Appellant felt that \nthe order for support should have been nullified because he had physical custody of his \ndaughter (Tr. 31). He also believed his former wife deliberately failed to cash a support \npayment check so that he would be cited for contempt (Tr. 32). He brought his check \nbook to court to prove he had money in his account to cover her support check (Tr. 32-\n34). He was unsuccessful in challenging the $6,800 support order (Tr. 32). Applicant \nwas released from custody when his wife\u2019s grandfather paid the support obligation on \nApplicant\u2019s behalf (Tr. 34). He is now current on all child support obligations (Tr. 35).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s former wife became involved in an abusive relationship (Tr. 16, 28). \nHis son was physically and emotionally abused (Tr. 22-23). His former wife had very \npoor judgment, and was a violent person (Tr. 34). Applicant\u2019s daughter, who is now 22 \nand married, accepted physical custody of Applicant\u2019s 16-year-old son (Tr. 23-24). \nApplicant engaged in additional expensive litigation with his former wife, and recently \ngained physical custody of his son from his daughter (Tr. 16-17, 20-25). His 16-year-old \nson now lives with Applicant and his current wife (Tr. 23-24). There have been medical \nexpenses and school expenses of $500 for his son (Tr. 25, 27). He is going to court in \nOctober 2008 to litigate gaining legal custody of his son (Tr. 25).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s current spouse earns about $1,500 monthly and Applicant\u2019s net pay \nis about $2,500 monthly (Tr. 35-36). His monthly rent is $1,600 (Tr. 36). His spouse\u2019s \nmonthly car payment is $179; however, the car payment is about two months delinquent \n(Tr. 37, 39). This car is solely in his spouse\u2019s name (Tr. 51). Applicant\u2019s other car is paid \noff (Tr. 37). Monthly day care costs are $400 (Tr. 37). He has no savings or other assets \n(Tr. 37). He and his spouse do not have any credit cards (Tr. 43). \n \nIn October 2007, Applicant told an investigator from the Office of Personnel \nManagement (OPM) that he expected to receive about $6,000 from a tax refund (Tr. \n38). He intended to use this refund to resolve some of his delinquent debts. At his \nhearing, he advised the refund was actually less than $6,000. It was not used to pay \nany of his delinquent debts. Instead, it was used for current bills, and to buy a new \nmattress (Tr. 38). Additionally, Applicant and his spouse moved to a more expensive \nrental (rent increased from $1,250 to $1,600) (Tr. 47). They moved because utilities \nwere less, the new residence was larger, and the old residence had a roach problem \n(Tr. 47-48). Other than the delinquent car loan, he does not have any other delinquent, \nnon-SOR debts (Tr. 43).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began in 2002 (Tr. 39). He has not contacted any \nof his creditors about the delinquent accounts (Tr. 39, 41). He has not had credit or \nfinancial counseling (Tr. 41). In 2002, Applicant used the money from his 401K account \nand did not file his tax return (Tr. 40). He went four of five years without filing his tax \nreturn, and then filed all his tax returns in 2007 (Tr. 40, 43). He subsequently learned \nthat he did not owe as much in taxes as he expected because of his filing status and \nother deductions (Tr. 41, 44). He missed some tax refunds because he did not file his \n\n \n \n4 \n \ntax returns (Tr. 44). He concluded that he lost about $150,000 over the years to contest \ncustody of his son and daughter (Tr. 41). He did not have any money to address his \ndelinquent SOR debts (Tr. 45). He planned to resolve the custody issues before doing \nanything on his delinquent debts (Tr. 42). He disputed the debt related to his eviction, \nasserting that the rental-residence had asbestos and the roof leaked (Tr. 45). He was \nnot sure whether he owed the landlord any money. The landlord retained the security \ndeposit, and the last month\u2019s rent (Tr. 46). He did not believe he was being sued over \nthe rent problem (Tr. 46).  \n \nApplicant\u2019s 12 delinquent debts or financial problems, include a total of about \n$15,000 in delinquent debt, which is summarized as follows (GE 6): \n \nSOR PARAGRAPH AND \nTYPE OF DEBT \nAMOUNT\nSTATUS \n\u00b6 1.a Taxes \nNone \nPaid (Tr. 40-45, GE 9) \n\u00b6 1.b Judgment \n$1,266 \nDelinquent-credit card (GE 3 at 4, 9) \n\u00b6 1.c Store \n$69 \nPayment Plan-bad check (GE 3 at 4, 9) \n\u00b6 1.d Store \n$217 \nReturned Check-groceries (GE 3 at 4, 9) \n\u00b6 1.e Medical \n$269 \nDelinquent-medical bill (GE 3 at 4, 9) \n\u00b6 1.f Store \n$526 \nDelinquent-wedding bands (GE 3 at 4, 9) \n\u00b6 1.g Vehicle Repossession \n$8,837 \nDelinquent (GE 3 at 4, 9) \n\u00b6 1.h Telephone \n$1,875 \nDelinquent-cell phone (GE 3 at 4, 9) \n\u00b6 1.i Credit Card \n$421 \nDelinquent (GE 9) \n\u00b6 1.j Landlord \nNone \nEvicted  in August 2003 for nonpayment \nof rent (GE 9)-Disputed debt \n\u00b6 1.k Collection Law Firm  \n$888 \nDelinquent-credit card (GE 3 at 4, 9) \n\u00b6 1.l Telephone \n$633 \nDelinquent (GE 9) \n \nApplicant was honest when he completed his security clearance application and \nresponded to interrogatories about his debts, a prior domestic violence incident, and his \nmarijuana use (Tr. 17). As indicated above, Applicant\u2019s employment after 2002 was at \nsignificantly lower pay (Tr. 16-17). He endeavored to work overtime to try to raise \nadditional income (Tr. 17). He thought if he had a clearance he could increase his \nannual income by about $15,000 (Tr. 18). His long-term goal was to continue to support \nhis children and to purchase a house (Tr. 49). He promised to never do anything to \njeopardize national security (Tr. 51). \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \n\n \n \n5 \n \n                                           \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nIn the decision-making process, the Government has the initial burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR by \u201csubstantial evidence,\u201d6 \ndemonstrating, in accordance with the Directive, that it is not clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s access to classified information. \nOnce the Government has produced substantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, \nthe burden shifts to Applicant to produce evidence \u201cto rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and [applicant] \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the \nGovernment. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).7 \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \n6 See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14. \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1). \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \n\u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 \nF.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \n \n7 \u201cThe Administrative Judge [considers] the record evidence as a whole, both favorable and \nunfavorable, evaluate[s] Applicant\u2019s past and current circumstances in light of pertinent provisions of the \nDirective, and decide[s] whether Applicant ha[s] met his or her burden of persuasion under Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-10340 at 2 (App. Bd. July 6, 2006). \n\n \n \n6 \n \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), Section 3. \n \nAnalysis \n \n  \nUpon consideration of all the facts in evidence, and after application of all \nappropriate legal precepts, factors, and conditions, including those described briefly \nabove, I conclude one relevant security concern is under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations). AG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \n \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds. \n  \n \nAG \u00b6 19 provides two financial considerations disqualifying conditions that could \nraise a security concern and may be disqualifying in this case, \u201c(a) inability or \nunwillingness to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) provides, \u201cApplicant\u2019s credit \nreport was sufficient to establish the Government\u2019s prima facie case that Applicant had . \n.  .  SOR delinquent debts that are of security concern.\u201d Applicant\u2019s history of delinquent \ndebt is documented in his credit reports (GE 4-6), his OPM interview, his response to \nDOHA interrogatories (GE 3), and his SOR response (GE 9). However, his denial that \nhe owes any tax debt and that he owes money from the eviction is sufficient to refute \nthe allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.j. As indicated in his statement at his hearing and in \nhis response to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b to 1.i, and 1.k and 1.l (GE 9), ten creditors have not been \npaid and there is currently no ability to initiate delinquent debt resolution. The \ngovernment established the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c).   \n \n  \nFive Financial Considerations Mitigating Conditions under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a)-(e) are \npotentially applicable:  \n \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n \n\n \n \n7 \n \n                                           \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem and/or \nthere are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; \n \n(d) the individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \notherwise resolve debts; and \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n \nApplicant\u2019s conduct does not warrant full application of AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) or 20(b) \nbecause he did not act more aggressively and responsibly to resolve ten delinquent \nSOR debts. Applicant has not made any progress resolving his ten delinquent debts \ntotaling about $15,000. His financial problems are not isolated. The ongoing nature of \nhis delinquent debts is \u201ca continuing course of conduct\u201d under the Appeal Board\u2019s \njurisprudence. See ISCR Case No. 07-11814 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2008) (citing ISCR \nCase No. 01-03695 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2002)). He receives partial credit under AG \u00b6 \n20(a) because the debt \u201coccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the [his] current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment.\u201d He has been paying his non-SOR debts, except his spouse\u2019s car payment is \nalso currently delinquent. Under AG \u00b6 20(b), he receives partial mitigation because his \nfinancial situation was damaged through his move away from a good job, which was \nrelated to his divorce and custody issues. His divorce was in 1996. He had problems \npaying his child support and his current spouse\u2019s grandfather paid his back child \nsupport of about $6,800. However, he did not provide sufficient information to establish \nthat he acted responsibly under the circumstances or made sufficient efforts to address \nhis delinquent debts.8 He admitted that he has not maintained contact with his creditors, \nand made no recent efforts to set up payment plans.    \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) have limited application. Applicant did not receive financial \ncounseling. There are some indications that \u201cthat the problem is being resolved or is \nunder control\u201d because the amount of delinquent debt is not that large, and there is very \nlittle new delinquent debt. There is insufficient information to establish that Applicant \nshowed good faith9 in the resolution of his delinquent SOR debts. \n \n8\u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since acted in a \nreasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. \nBd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). \n \n9The Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \n \n\n \n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                            \n \nAG \u00b6 20(e) mitigates his tax debt and his landlord\u2019s eviction. Although he did not \nprovide \u201cdocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute\u201d with respect to \nthese debts, I will give him credit for mitigating them. The SOR does not list any amount \nowed, and I found him to be credible concerning these debts. I will find \u201cFor Applicant\u201d \nwith respect to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.j in the decretal paragraph of this decision.   \n \nI conclude Applicant\u2019s overall conduct with his creditors casts doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. His ten delinquent SOR debts \ntotal about $15,000 and likely will remain at that level for the foreseeable future. He is \nan honest, hard-working employee and a good father. Notwithstanding these positive \nattributes, he has not established his financial responsibility and that he has the \njudgment necessary to hold a security clearance. Based on my evaluation of the record \nevidence as a whole, I conclude no mitigating conditions fully apply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n Under the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must be \nan overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines \nand the whole person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c).   \n \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or \nsome other good-faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does \nnot define the term \u2018good-faith.\u2019 However, the Board has indicated that the concept of \ngood-faith \u2018requires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u2019 Accordingly, an applicant must \ndo more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmitigating condition].  \n \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting \nISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001)).  \n\n \n \n9 \n \nThere is some evidence tending to mitigate Applicant\u2019s conduct under the whole \nperson concept. He is not financially sophisticated. He went though years of litigation \nconcerning custody and support issues from his failed marriage. He paid his back taxes \nin 2007. His dedication to his current family and his children from his previous marriage \nis a very positive indication of his good character and trustworthiness. He is a patriot \nand is completely loyal to his country. Applicant\u2019s record of good employment weighs in \nhis favor. There is no evidence of any security violation. Except for his spouse\u2019s car \nloan, his other non-SOR debts are current and being paid.  \n \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole person concept and the adjudicative \nguidelines are not sufficient to warrant a clearance at this time. The overall amount of \nhis delinquent debts at about $15,000 is substantial. He has been aware of his \ndelinquent debts since at least 2007. His failure to file his taxes from 2002 to 2007 \nshows avoidance of lawful responsibilities as a citizen and tax payer over those five \nyears. For the remaining $15,000 of his SOR debt, he has done little to address that \ndebt. Applicant learned of the security significance of his delinquent debt when he had \nhis interview by an OPM investigator on July 23, 2007 (GE 3). He said he was going to \nuse a refund of about $6,000 to address his delinquent debts. He used the refund for a \nmore expensive rental, a new mattress and other current debts. The government\u2019s \nsecurity concern about his delinquent debts was reinforced when he received the DOHA \ninterrogatories, and again when he responded to the SOR (GE 9). Yet, he made no real \nprogress in resolving his delinquent SOR debts. His handling of his delinquent SOR \ndebt shows lack of responsibility, rehabilitation, and mitigation. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all the facts and circumstances, in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude he has not mitigated the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns.    \n \nI take this position based on the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518 (1988), my careful consideration of the whole person factors and \nsupporting evidence, my application of the pertinent factors under the Adjudicative \nProcess, and my interpretation of my  responsibilities under the Guidelines. Applicant \nhas not mitigated or overcome the government\u2019s case. For the reasons stated, I \nconclude he is not eligible for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:          \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b to 1.i:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j:  \n \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.k and 1.i: \n Against Applicant \n \n\n \n \n10 \n \nConclusion \n \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance. Eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nMark W. Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n",

His latest \narrest and conviction occurred in April 2006. It is too soon to find his alcohol-related \nproblems will not recur. Applicant has failed to rebut or mitigate the government\u2019s \nsecurity concerns under alcohol consumption.

He \nis a strong leader and dependable team player who has good judgment, a mature \noutlook, and displays a high degree of integrity and responsibility. (Ex. D)  \n \nIn March 1991, Applicant\u2014then age 36\u2014was arrested and charged with Driving \nWhile Intoxicated (DWI). (Gov Ex 6) No breath test was conduct. He had been at the \npark with friends playing ball and drinking beer. (Tr. 35) He was arrested after he \ndropped off his cousin. The police officer thought he was in the neighborhood buying \nillegal drugs. The record contains no finding of guilt or sentence. Applicant states he \nreceived six months probation. It was Applicant\u2019s understanding that after six month the \nmatter would be dismissed. (Tr. 54)  \n \nOn December 24 1998, Applicant\u2014then age 43\u2014was stopped for speeding and \ncharged with DWI and deadly conduct. Applicant and his wife were on a two and a half \nhour drive returning from a visit to his mother-in-law\u2019s home. He was attempting to get \nhome before freezing ice made the roadways hazardous. (Tr. 41) In May 1999, he \npleaded guilty to deadly conduct2 and was placed on supervised probation for six \nmonths. (Gov Ex 2) Applicant thought the charge had been changed from \u201cdeadly \nconduct\u201d to \u201creckless conduct.\u201d (Tr. 33) He was ordered to perform 80 hours of \ncommunity service, pay a $400 fine, pay $40 per month in supervision fees, and \n \n2 Under the state law a person commits the offense of deadly conduct if he recklessly engages in conduct \nthat places another in imminent danger of serious bodily injury. \n\n \n \n \n3\n$199.25 in court costs. He was required to undergo evaluation by the county community \nsupervision and corrections department to determine if alcohol/drug rehabilitation was \nnecessary and if necessary participate in treatment. He was ordered to complete an \nalcohol evaluation and the Alcohol Education Program. Count 1, DWI, was dismissed. \n(Gov Ex 2) Following his conviction, he attended some group counseling. (Tr. 46) \nTraveling to court and for probation involved a 300 mile round trip drive. (Tr. 34)  \n \nIn April 2006, Applicant\u2014then age 51\u2014was stopped for speeding and charged \nwith DWI, third offense, and open container. (Gov Ex 4, 6) Applicant and his wife were \ntraveling to his mother-in-law\u2019s home and had stopped and each purchased a 16 ounce \nbeer. (Tr. 42) He was found guilty and sentenced to six months confinement \n(suspended), 18 months probation, 75 hours of community service, to pay a $1,000 fine, \nto pay $333 in court costs, and to attend DWI class. (Gov Ex 5) DWI class was for four \ndays in December 2007. (Gov Ex 3) He was placed on probation in November 2007 and \nwill remain on probation until May 2009. He has completed all of the required programs \nfor his probation and attended all scheduled appointments. January 9, 2009, was his \nnext scheduled appointment and was to be his last provided all fees had been paid. (Ex. \nE) Applicant traveled 110 miles each way each month to see his probation officer. (Tr. \n30-31) Applicant has not had any alcohol since his arrest. (Tr. 45, 52)  \n \nIn March 2007, Applicant completed an Electronic Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP). Some of the questions on the e-QIP are limited to \nthe prior seven year. When asked in question 23.d about having ever been charged with \nor convicted of any offense related to alcohol or drugs, he listed his April 2006 offense, \nfor which he was awaiting a court date. He did not list any other arrests. Even though \nthe question is not so worded, Applicant took the question to reflect arrest occurring \nduring the seven year period prior his completion of the e-QIP. (Tr. 47)  \n \nIn November 2007, he made a signed, sworn statement to an investigator \nrelating the facts of his 2006 arrest, conviction, and sentence. He stated he had been \narrested in 1999 for reckless driving. He stated he went to court and was found guilty of \nreckless driving forfeited his $500 bond and received six months probation, which he \ncompleted in 2000. (Gov Ex 3) He revealed a 1994 domestic disturbance arrest and a \n1991 charge for DWI when empty beer cans were found under his car seat. In the \nsworn statement, he stated he had been arrested only once for DWI during the prior \nseven years. He failed to list his 1998 DWI and deadly conduct.  \n \nApplicant is involved with his church and community outreach programs with the \nchurch. (Tr. 51) Applicant realizes the mistakes he has made drinking and driving. He \nthought about it a good deal on the long drives to court and to see his probation officer. \n(Tr. 52) He has not consumed alcohol for 18 months and does not believe it will be a \nproblem for him in the future.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \n\n \n \n \n4\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nAlcohol Consumption \n \nAdjudicative Guideline (AG) for determining eligibility for access to classified \ninformation \u00b6 21 expresses the security concern pertaining to alcohol consumption, \n\n \n \n \n5\n\u201cExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or \nthe failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability \nand trustworthiness.\u201d \n \nApplicant is 53 years old and has had three arrests for DWI. In 1991, Applicant, \nthen age 36, was arrested after playing ball and drinking beer in a park with friends. He \nreceived six months probation. In 1998, Applicant, then age 43, was again arrested for \nDWI and deadly conduct and found guilty of the \u201cdeadly conduct,\u201d which he believed \nhad been changed to \u201creckless conduct.\u201d Under the state law deadly conduct is reckless \nconduct that places another in imminent danger of serious bodily injury. His court \nappearance and probation involved making a 300 mile round trip drive. It cost him in \nexcess of $800, 80 hours of community service, and attorney fees.  \n \nIn 2006, Applicant, then age 51, was charged with DWI 3rd and open container. \nAfter being found guilty, he paid a $1,000 fine, $333 in court costs, received 18 months \nprobation, and had to perform 75 hours community service. His round trip from home to \ncourt and the probation office was in excess of 200 miles. He was going to visit his \nmother-in-law and stopped and purchased a beer while on the trip. After having been \narrested eight years earlier for DWI, one would have thought he would have purchased \ncoffee or a soft drink for the trip and waited until arriving at this destination before \ndrinking beer.  \n \nAG \u00b6 22(a) \u201calcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed as an alcohol \nabuser or alcohol dependent,\u201d applies as evidenced by the three alcohol related arrests.  \n \nAG \u00b6 23 lists conditions that could mitigate the alcohol consumption security \nconcerns. Those conditions include:  \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or \nit happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nor does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her alcoholism or issues of \nalcohol abuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence (if alcohol \ndependent) or responsible use (if an alcohol abuser); \n \n(c) the individual is a current employee who is participating in a \ncounseling or treatment program, has no history of previous treatment and \nrelapse, and is making satisfactory progress; and, \n \n(d) the individual has successfully completed inpatient or outpatient \ncounseling or rehabilitation along with any required aftercare, has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \n\n \n \n \n6\nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations, such as \nparticipation in meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or a similar \norganization and has received a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional or a licensed clinical social worker who is a staff \nmember of a recognized alcohol treatment program. \n \nNone of the mitigating factors listed in AG \u00b6 23 apply. Applicant states he has not \ndrank alcohol since the 2006 arrest. Applicant is still on probation and a normal \nrequirement for probation is to abstain from all alcohol or abstain from alcohol before \ndriving during the term of probation. Applicant\u2019s second arrest was seven years after the \nfirst. Applicant\u2019s third arrest was eight years after the second. It has now been two years \nsince his last arrest. It is too early to predict Applicant\u2019s alcohol problem is a thing of the \npast.  \n \nAG \u00b6 23(a) does not apply because it has only been two years since his last \narrest and the conduct did not occur under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur. Additionally, his conduct especially after two prior arrests, does cast doubt on \nthe Applicant\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \n \nAG \u00b6 23(b) does not apply. Applicant believes alcohol will not be a problem for \nhim in the future. He has abstained since his last arrest, but that may be a condition of \nhis probation, which ends in May 2009. There is no evidence of actions to overcome his \nproblem. Neither AG \u00b6 23(c), requiring participation a counseling or treatment program \nand to be making satisfactory progress, nor AG \u00b6 23(d), which requires successfully \ncompleted inpatient or outpatient counseling or rehabilitation and demonstrating a clear \nand established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence, apply. There is no \nfavorable prognosis by a doctor only Applicant\u2019s self serving statement that alcohol will \nnot be a problem in the future.  \n \nWith three arrests over the course of 17 years, with the last arrest only two years \nago, it is too early to state Applicant\u2019s alcohol consumption is no longer a problem.  \n \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct, which is \nconduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. Of special interest is any \nfailure to provide truthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or \nany other failure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \n \nIn March 2007, Applicant completed his e-QIP and listed his most recent DWI \narrest. Even though the clear and plain language of question 23.d asks if Applicant had \n\u201cever\u201d been charged or arrests for an alcohol-related offense, Applicant limited his \nresponse to the prior seven years. Other questions in the e-QIP so limit the period of \ntime, however, this question is not so limited.  \n \n\n \n \n \n7\nDeliberate omissions, concealment, or falsifications of material facts in any \nwritten document or oral statement to the Government, when applying for a security \nclearance, are certainly of security concern. But every inaccurate statement is not a \nfalsification. A falsification must be deliberate and material. It is deliberate if it is done \nknowingly and willfully.  \n \nI found Applicant=s explanation for failure to list his other two alcohol-related \narrests plausible. After hearing his testimony, observing his demeanor, and evaluating \nall the evidence of record, I found his testimony credible on the falsification issue. I am \nsatisfied Applicant\u2019s answers on his e-QIP was not a deliberate concealment or \nfalsification.  \n \nIn a November 2007 sworn statement, Applicant stated he was arrested for \nreckless driving in 1999. He explains how he was stopped for speeding, held at the \ndetention center, posted $500 bond, later appeared in court, was found guilty, forfeited \nthe bond and was given six months probation. He was actually arrested Christmas eve \nin 1998 and not 1999. He said it was for reckless driving when it was for DWI and \ndeadly conduct. I will not hold Applicant chargeable with legalize or terms of art.  \n \nUnder the state law, deadly conduct is reckless conduct and it is easy for one \nunversed in the law to substitute reckless for deadly. Reckless conduct is more \nfrequently associated with drinking and driving then is deadly conduct. It does not \nappear Applicant was deliberately trying to conceal his 1998 arrest when he misstated \nthe charge. There was no deliberate concealment or falsification, I find for Applicant as \nto SOR \u00b6 2. a and 2.b. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  \n \n\n \n \n \n8\nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is an outstanding worker, \nhighly thought of by his supervisors and colleagues. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. Applicant has had three alcohol-related arrests. His alcohol-\nrelated arrests have cost him thousands of dollars and numerous hours traveling to \ncourt and to see his probation officer. Yet he does not believe alcohol has been or is a \nproblem for him. Having abstained from alcohol for only two years, it is too soon to say \nhis alcohol-related problems will not recur. It is noted there was a seven year period \nbetween his first and second arrest and an eight year period between his second and \nthird arrests.  \n \nAlthough his evidence of rehabilitation is insufficient at this time, this decision \nshould not be construed as a determination that Applicant can not or will not attain the \nstate of true reform and rehabilitation necessary to justify the award of a DoD security \nclearance. In the future, should he be afforded an opportunity to reapply for a security \nclearance, with the passage of sufficient additional time, continued rehabilitation, and no \nfuture incidents of misconduct, the alcohol consumption could be found in Applicant's \nfavor. He may well demonstrate persuasive evidence of security worthiness. But that \ntime has not yet arrived. Because the Applicant meets the disqualifying conditions and \nnone of the mitigating conditions, the alcohol security concern is resolved against him. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Alcohol Consumption: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a \u2013 1.d: \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Personal Conduct:   \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 2.a and 2.b:  \nFor Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n \n_________________ \nCLAUDE R. HEINY II \nAdministrative Judge \n \n",

Farhat, Esq. \n \n \n______________ \n \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nDAM, Shari, Administrative Judge: \n \n \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility \nfor access to classified information is granted. \n \n  History of Case \n \nOn May 9, 2005, Applicant submitted his Security Clearance Application (SF 86). \nOn February 29, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing the security concerns under \nGuideline B (Foreign Influence). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on March 25, 2008, and requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel was prepared to proceed \nAugust 20, 2008\n\n \n \n \n \n2\non April 17, 2008. The case was originally assigned to me in April 2008 and then \nreassigned to another administrative judge on June 19, 2008. DOHA issued a Notice of \nHearing on June 25, 2008, scheduling the hearing for July 15, 2008. On July 14, 2008, \nthe assigned administrative judge had a medical emergency that necessitated the \ncancellation of the hearing. The hearing was rescheduled to July 17, 2008, and \nreassigned to me. I convened the hearing on said date. The Government offered \nExhibits (GE) 1 and 2 into evidence, which were admitted without objection. Applicant \ntestified and offered Exhibits (AE) A through J into evidence that were admitted without \nobjection. His wife also testified. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on \nJuly 25, 2008.  \n \nProcedural and Evidentiary Rulings \n \nRequest for Administrative Notice \n \nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice \nof certain facts relating to Iraq. (Tr. 14-15) The request and the attached documents are \nincluded in the record as Hearing Exhibits (HE) I through V. Applicant\u2019s counsel did not \nobject to my consideration of those Exhibits. Hence, the facts administratively noticed \nare limited to matters of general knowledge and matters not subject to reasonable \ndispute. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated March 25, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual \nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.f of the SOR. He denied \u00b6 1.a, noting that his mother \ndied in December 2007.  \n \n \nApplicant is 58 years old. He was born in Iraq and went to high school there. \nFrom September 1969 to June 1971, he attended a teacher\u2019s college in Iraq and \ngraduated with a teaching degree. (Tr. 26). As required by the Iraqi government, he \nserved in its army for a year and a half after graduation from college. After completing \nmilitary service, he taught elementary school in Iraq from September 1973 to June \n1980. (GE 2). \n \n \nApplicant \u201calways had a dream to come to the United States.\u201d (Tr. 106). In July \n1980, Applicant left Iraq and went to Germany. At the time, he was distressed over the \npolitical and religious atmosphere in Iraq under Saddam Hussein. (Tr. 89). After being \ngranted asylum as a refugee in the United States, he arrived here in April 1982. (Tr. 29). \nIn October 1986, he married his wife, a U.S. citizen. They have two children, both born \nin the United States. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in December 1987. He \nowned and operated a gas station from 1993 to 2003, and an ice cream store that his \nwife operated from 2003 to 2006. (Tr. 104).  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents were born in Iraq. Both are deceased. His father, who worked \nin an oil refinery, died in 1994, and his mother, a homemaker, died in December 2007. \n\n \n \n \n \n3\nHe is one of eight children, all born in Iraq. He has five brothers and two sisters. Three \nbrothers are resident citizens of Iraq. They are married to Iraqi citizens and have \nchildren. One of those brothers is a retired music teacher. Applicant speaks to him once \nevery two to three months. (Tr. 36). Another brother, age 61, works in an oil refinery in \nIraq. He has a son who lives in the United States. Applicant has had very limited \ncommunication with this brother. (Tr. 39). However, Applicant has seen his nephew a \ncouple times in the United States. His 56-year old brother is a welder for an oil \ncompany. He lived with his mother until she died in December 2007. When Applicant \nphoned his mother, he sometimes spoke to this brother. Applicant has not seen any of \nthese brothers since leaving Iraq in 1980. (Tr. 42). He had not seen his mother since \nleaving Iraq in 1980. (Tr. 48). \n \n \nAnother brother is a citizen and resident of the United Kingdom. He is married \nand has two children. He owns a dry cleaning store. Applicant saw this brother in \nDecember 2005 when Applicant and his family vacationed in London for a week. Prior \nto this visit, Applicant had not seen this brother since leaving Iraq in 1980. (Tr. 44). He \ndoes not speak to his brother very often, but spoke to him after his mother died. While in \nEngland in 2005, he asked his brother to tell his family in Iraq that he would not have \ncontact with them in the future because of the potential problems such communication \ncould have with his job. (Tr. 96). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s fifth brother lives in Sweden. He has not seen this brother since 1980. \nHe has not maintained contact with his brother over the years, but did speak to him after \nhis mother died. He does not know what this brother does for a living. (Tr. 46-47). \n \n \nApplicant has two sisters who are citizens and residents of Iraq. Both are married \nto Iraqi citizens and have children. Their husbands work in the oil refineries. One of his \nsisters is a teacher and the other is a housewife. Applicant has not seen either sister \nsince 1980. (Tr. 35). He had periodic contact with them if they were visiting his mother \nwhen he telephoned her. (Tr.  49-54 ). \n \n \n \n \nIn February 2004, Applicant was hired as a linguist to support the U.S. military \nforces in Iraq. Prior to going to Iraq, he took a polygraph test and underwent medical \nevaluations. He subsequently received an interim secret clearance that gave him \naccess to classified information. (Tr. 87). In April 2004, he returned to Iraq for the first \ntime since leaving it in July 1980. One of his first assignments was to work in the field \non various missions.  After being involved in an explosion, he transferred to a detainee \ncenter where he translated information from the detainees. (Tr. 63). From that point until \nhe left Iraq in November 2007, he continued working as a translator in detention \ncenters. After going to Iraq in April 2004, he returned home to the United States for two \nweek intervals, approximately every six months during his employment. (Tr. 84-86). In \nNovember 2007, his employer gave him a leave of absence, pending the outcome of \nthis proceeding. (Tr. 80). \n \n \nWhile in Iraq, Applicant did not visit his family. He called them periodically, in \nparticular his mother who became ill.  His commander knew Applicant had family in Iraq \n\n \n \n \n \n4\nand approved Applicant\u2019s phone calls to them. (Tr. 71-72). Applicant noted that all calls \nare monitored in Iraq. None of his family members knows what role he performs for the \nU.S. government, nor do they ask. (Tr. 96). His family does not sympathize with the \nterrorist organizations that oppose the United States. (Tr. 81). Applicant never left the \nU.S. camps while assigned there. (Tr. 68; 73). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife credibly testified.  She affirmed Applicant\u2019s tremendous pride in \nhis U.S. citizenship and desire to help this nation. She does not believe he could be \ninfluenced or coerced into doing something that would harm the U.S. interests because \nhis loyalties are solely with his immediate family in the U.S. and this country. (Tr. 113-\n114).    \n \n \n \n \nApplicant owns a house in the United States and has U. S. bank accounts. (Tr. \n103). He does not own any property in Iraq. (Tr. 55). There is no derogatory information \nin the record concerning his police or financial records. He has never been fired from a \njob. He has never been arrested. He has never used illegal drugs, or been involved in \nan alcohol-related incident. (GE 1).  \n \n \nWithout including too many details in this opinion, I will summarize that his \nperformance in Iraq, in direct support of the United States\u2019 war on terror has been \nsuperior. In August 2004, Applicant\u2019s supervisor, from June 2004 to August 2004, at a \ndetention center wrote, \u201cDisplaying an exemplary attitude and an acute attention to \ndetail, [Applicant\u2019s] efforts were invaluable and led to further detention of potential \nelements of terrorist organizations!\u201d (AE F). In February 2005, a Technical Sergeant in \nthe Air Force submitted a Letter of Evaluation on behalf of Applicant, detailing nine \nareas of accomplishment. In the concluding sentence, he said, \u201cAs you can see, \n[Applicant] is a dedicated professional, with unsurpassed excellence that contributes to \nmission success!\u201d (AE D). Applicant\u2019s site manager, from December until August 2007, \ncommented, \u201cA consistently superior performer, he went above and beyond his normal \nduties significantly contributing to the success of the Defense Intelligence Agency cell at \nthe detention center.\u201d (AE G).  In May 2008, a team leader for Applicant\u2019s unit, stated, \n\u201cAs one of the few linguists of actual Iraqi descent in the office he was used immensely \nto obtain actual time sensitive intelligence needed to accomplish the mission . . . His \nhonorable, faithful, and patriotic service in a difficult and demanding combat \nenvironment reflects great credit upon himself.\u201d (AE H) \n \n \nThere is no evidence in the record that Applicant breached any security policies \nor procedures while holding a security clearance in Iraq.  \n \n \nApplicant credibly and sincerely asserted his pride of U.S. citizenship and desire \nto resume his work with the U.S. Army. The director of the linguist operations, who has \nworked with Applicant from October 2005 into May 2008, requested that \u201cas much \nconsideration be given as possible in reinstating [Applicant\u2019s] clearance. The \ngovernment is currently in need of [Applicant\u2019s] unique skills and experience and is \nanxiously awaiting his return.\u201d (AE J).  Applicant testified: \n \n\n \n \n \n \n5\n\u201cI love this country and I took this job as volunteer job, and I know there is \na risk going there. But I love into this country and I promise myself since I \nenter this country I will be very very loyal to this country. And in any time \nthis country needs me I will be there to help this country. Because I didn\u2019t \nhave country in 1982. This country allow and accept me as a refugee, and \nI came over here. And I promise since then, and God bless me, when time \ncame and I volunteered to take this job and go over there.\u201d [Sic] (Tr. 81-\n82). \n \nI take administrative notice of the facts set forth in the Hearing Exhibits, including \nthe fact that in 2003, the United States led a coalition to remove Saddam Hussein from \npower in Iraq. After free elections, Iraq\u2019s new government took office. Despite the \nelections and new government, Iraq remains engulfed in violence, perpetrated by Al \nQaeda terrorists and other insurgents. Numerous attacks and kidnappings have \ntargeted the U.S. Armed Forces, contractors, and other civilians, as well as Iraqis. Even \nwith aggressive governmental action against terrorists, the threat of terrorism in Iraq \nremains, although there has been a decrease in violence since January 2001. \u201cAn \nimproved security environment has resulted from the combined factors of Coalition \ntroop surge and sustained presence, the declared ceasefire by Muqtada al-Sadr\u2019s Jaysh \nal Mahdi militia in August, improved Iraqi Security Forces proficiency, and increasing \npopular support for the actions of Iraqi Forces again AQI and other extremist groups.\u201d \n(HE IV). Terrorist groups conduct intelligence activities as effectively as state \nintelligence services.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record.  \n\n \n \n \n \n6\n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions adverse to an \napplicant shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for foreign influence is set out in \nAG & 6:       \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign county in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nAG \u00b6 7 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. Department Counsel argued that the evidence in this case established two \nof them: \n \n\n \n \n \n \n7\n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion;1 and, \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information. \n \nSince 1980, Applicant has had some telephone contact with his mother, and five \nsiblings, who are residents and citizens of Iraq. After he started working in Iraq in 2004, \nhe telephoned his elderly mother periodically. If any of his siblings were visiting her, he \nalso spoke to them. His commander had full knowledge of, and approved, these \ntelephone contacts. After his mother\u2019s death in December 2007, he ceased contact with \nhis family, knowing that such communication could jeopardize his employment. \nApplicant\u2019s connections to his family in Iraq could create a potential conflict of interest \nbetween his security obligations and his desire to help them, only in a situation wherein \nthey were taken hostage or otherwise threatened with harm if he did not cooperate. \nNone of them have any government connection or other position in which they could \notherwise benefit from his access to sensitive information or technology. However, \nunder either disqualifying condition, security concerns in this case could arise in \nconnection with the potential that hostile forces might seek protected information from \nApplicant by threatening harm to his family members in Iraq.  \n  \n  \nThe Government produced substantial evidence of these disqualifying conditions, \nand the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation of the \nresulting security concerns. AG \u00b6 8 provides conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Those with potential application in this case are:  \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.;   \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \n                                            \n1 The mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, as a matter of \nlaw, disqualifying under Guideline B. However, if only one relative lives in a foreign country and an \napplicant has contacts with that relative, this factor alone is sufficient to create the potential for foreign \ninfluence and could potentially result in the compromise of classified information. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2006); ISCR Case No. 99-0424 (App. Bd. Feb. 8, 2001). \n \n\n \n \n \n \n8\nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \n \nThe positions and activities of Applicant\u2019s family members in Iraq do not involve \nthe government or military and they would have no interest in acquiring protected \ninformation. Only their physical presence creates the potential that their interests could \nbe threatened to the point that Applicant would confront a choice between their interest \nand those of the United States.  Because they are strongly opposed to terrorism in Iraq, \nthe likelihood of such a situation is substantially reduced. The Iraqi government is a U.S. \nally that does not pose an intelligence risk through Applicant\u2019s family members, who \nsupport the Iraqi and coalition efforts to defeat terrorists and establish a working \ndemocracy. Hence, AG \u00b6 8(a) has some application.  \n \nApplicant produced very significant evidence establishing mitigating condition \n8(b). Based on his relationship and depth of loyalty to the U.S., he can be expected to \nresolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. He has lived in the United \nStates since 1982 and did not return to Iraq until his employment with the U. S. Army in \n2004. His wife and children, to whom he is very dedicated, are U.S. citizens, residing in \nthe United States. He owns property and holds bank accounts in the United States. He \nowned and operated two businesses here before starting his position with a federal \ncontractor. He does not own property in Iraq and has had very limited contact with his \nfamily members living there since 1980. While in Iraq, he willingly risked his own life to \nsupport the U.S. troops. There is no evidence that he has connections or contact with \nany people other than his family members. \n \nApplicant attempted to establish mitigating condition 8(c) through description of \nhis contacts and communications with his family members as infrequent and very \ncasual.  Although he has ceased communication with his family in Iraq since his \nmother\u2019s death in December 2007, his previous contacts with her and his siblings were \nsporadic, but nonetheless on-going. Hence, 8(c) cannot be given full application.  \n \n\u201cWhole Person\u201d Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \n\n \n \n \n \n9\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept. The Appeal \nBoard requires the whole person analysis address \u201cevidence of an applicant\u2019s \npersonal loyalties; the nature and extent of an applicant\u2019s family ties to the U.S. \nrelative to his [or her] ties to a foreign country; his or her social ties within the U.S.; \nand many others raised by the facts of a given case.\u201d ISCR Case No. 04-00540 at 7 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 5, 2007).   \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Three circumstances weigh against \nApplicant in the whole person analysis.  First, there is a significant risk of terrorism and \nhuman rights abuses in Iraq. More importantly for security purposes, terrorists are \nhostile to the United States and actively seek classified information. Terrorists, and even \nfriendly governments, could attempt to use Applicant\u2019s siblings to obtain such \ninformation. Second, he had numerous connections to Iraq before he immigrated to the \nUnited States in 1982. Following his birth, he spent his formative years there. He was \neducated at an Iraqi college and was conscripted into its army. Third, five of his siblings \nand their families remain resident citizens of Iraq.  \n \nSubstantial mitigating evidence weighs in favor of granting Applicant a security \nclearance. He is a mature person, who has lived in the United States for 26 years, and \nhas been a naturalized citizen for about 15 years.  His spouse is a native-born U. S.  \ncitizen, as are his children. Out of his sense of patriotism and love for the United States, \nhe joined the U.S. troops as an Arabic-speaking linguist. His ties to the United States, \nwhich he refers to as his country, are much stronger than his ties to his five siblings \nliving in Iraq. There is no evidence he has ever taken any action that could cause \npotential harm to the United States. He takes his loyalty to the United States seriously, \nand he has worked diligently for a defense contractor for several years in an important \ncapacity for the U.S. military. His supervisors assess him as loyal, trustworthy, \nconscientious, and responsible, giving him excellent evaluations and praising his \ndedication to the cause of freedom in Iraq. He is an excellent family member, employee \nand U.S. citizen. After leaving Iraq in 1982, he never returned until he worked with the \nU.S. forces in April 2004. He has not seen those family members living in Iraq since \n1980. No witnesses recommended denial of his security clearance. There is not any \nderogatory information about him in the record.  \n \nApplicant held a Secret security clearance during his tenure with U.S. military \nforces without any indication that he breached security policies or procedures. While \nthat fact is not normally considered as a significant factor in granting a clearance, the \n\n \n \n \n \n10\nAppeal Board ruled in ISCR Case No. 05-03846 at 6 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2006) as \nfollows: \n \nAs a general rule, Judges are not required to assign an applicant\u2019s prior \nhistory of complying with security procedures and regulations significant \nprobative value for purposes of refuting, mitigating, or extenuating the \nsecurity concerns raised by that applicant\u2019s more immediate disqualifying \nconduct or circumstances. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-03357 at 4 (App. \nBd. Dec. 13, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-10113 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, \n2005); ISCR Case No. 03-10955 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 30, 2006). \nHowever, the Board has recognized an exception to that general rule in \nGuideline B cases, where the applicant has established by credible, \nindependent evidence that his compliance with security procedures and \nregulations occurred in the context of dangerous, high-risk circumstances \nin which the applicant had made a significant contribution to the national \nsecurity. See, e.g. ISCR Case No. 04-12363 at 2 (App. Bd. July 14, 2006). \nThe presence of such circumstances can give credibility to an applicant\u2019s \nassertion that he can be relied upon to recognizes, resist, and report a \nforeign power\u2019s attempts at coercion or exploitation. \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions, and all facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person, including Applicant\u2019s commendable \nperformance as a translator in Iraq, I conclude Applicant has fully mitigated the security \nconcerns pertaining to foreign influence.2 Overall, the record evidence leaves no doubt \nas to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, \nI conclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising under Guideline B.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.f: \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n2 I conclude that the whole person analysis weighs heavily toward approval of his security clearance. \nAssuming a higher authority reviewing this decision determines the mitigating conditions articulated under \nAG \u00b6 8 do not apply and severs any consideration of them, I conclude the whole person analysis standing \nalone is sufficient to support approval of a security clearance in this case. \n\n \n \n \n \n11\nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n                                             \n________________ \nSHARI DAM \nAdministrative Judge \n",

On March 5, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines F, and E\nfor Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the\ncase assignment on April 10, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on April 14, 2008,\nand I convened the hearing as scheduled on May 7, 2008. The hearing was continued\non June 19, 2008. The Government offered Exhibits (GE 1-7), which were received\nwithout objection. Applicant testified in his own behalf, and presented the testimony of\none witness. He submitted Exhibits (AE A-D), without objection. DOHA received the first\nJuly 14, 2008\n\n2\ntranscript on May 15, 2008 and the final transcript on June 27, 2008. Based upon a\nreview of the record, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated March 14, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.o of the SOR. He also admitted the two answers on his security\nclearance application were incorrect as indicated in \u00b6 2.a-2.b of the SOR but denied any\nintentional falsification. He provided additional information to support his request for\neligibility for a security clearance. \nApplicant is a 24-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school in June 2002. He has worked for his current employer since December\n2004 (GE 1). Applicant held a security clearance from 2004 until the present (Tr. 40).\nApplicant married in 2006. He and his wife have one infant son, aged eight\nmonths (Tr. 19). His wife had many medical problems before her pregnancy. She had\nsurgery due to these medical conditions. The couple incurred many medical bills due to\nthe hospitalizations and treatments of his wife. They have incurred medical bills from the\nbirth of their child. His wife had a difficult pregnancy and more problems after the birth of\nher son.\nApplicant has diligently worked in an apprenticeship program for his current\nemployer for the past four years. He is almost at the completion of the program. He\nenjoys the work and will get an increase in salary as soon as he finishes the\napprenticeship. This will be very soon. His wife has returned to work recently.\nApplicant explained that he was the sole earner for his family for the past two\nyears. He had unexpected medical bills, doctor bills and various expenses involved with\nthe birth of his son. He also acknowledged that some of the delinquent accounts stem\nfrom his ex-fianc\u00e9e who charged things on his accounts without his permission. He\nacknowledges he was not responsible enough at that time in his life. He is adamant that\nnow that he has worked very hard in his apprenticeship program and is so near to his\ngoal that he would not do anything to jeopardize his future with his employer. He is also\nconcerned about providing for his wife and infant son (Tr. 19). In fact, he has paid his\nwife\u2019s previous medical bills that are not really reflected in the SOR.\nThe SOR alleges 15 delinquent debts, including two judgments for $160\n(medical) and $875 and a truck repossession. The total amount of debt that Applicant\nowes is approximately $20,000 (GE7). Some of the debts are medical in nature. The\nlargest debt is $7,112 for a truck repossession in 2005. Applicant turned the car back to\nthe dealer when he could no longer afford the payments. His counselor is trying to\nnegotiate the amount for settlement without interest and fees which would greatly\nreduce the amount owed (Tr. 25). The next largest debt is $2,817 for a credit card. His\nformer fiancee used his credit card to charge items that he was not aware of at the time.\nApplicant does not recognize the debt of $520 for a collection account. His counselor is\n\n3\ndisputing this account. The furniture account for $1,093 is also being investigated by his\ncredit counselor because Applicant does not recognize it and he is paying on another\nfurniture account now (AE B).\nApplicant admitted owing the debts listed in the SOR. The following account is in\nrepayment status: \u00b6 1.b for a computer that he purchased in 2005. The amount of the\ndebt at present is $2,206. Applicant has paid $25 a month on that account since 2006.\nHe provided proof of that automatic debit from his bank account at the hearing (AE A).\nThe other debts have not been paid. Applicant is working with a counselor to prepare a\nplan for payments or settlement. In addition, the income that his wife is generating now\nwill go toward paying all the smaller debts (Tr. 39).\nApplicant and his wife are receiving financial counseling with Hall Enterprises.\nHis counselor is negotiating with various creditors that he contacted in the past few\nmonths. Applicant had not looked at his credit report prior to the security investigation.\nHe does not recognize some of the debts. The counselor is investigating some larger\naccounts that might settle for a lower amount or have the interest and fees reduced.\nThe counselor told Applicant that she discovered \u201cviolations\u201d or duplications on his\ncredit report (GE 6) He has deferred to her judgment since she has experience in this\narea (Tr. 24). As noted above some of the accounts may be duplicates.\nApplicant\u2019s current monthly net income is $3,848.36. After monthly expenses of\n$1,610.26, he has a net remainder of approximately $1,1610 (AE C). He is paying on a\nfurniture bill that is not listed in the SOR. That account will be paid in full very soon (AE\nB). He and his wife are current on their expenses. They do not have any current debt.\nThey are in the process of relocating to find a more affordable rent which would give\nthem more discretionary income to apply to the remaining debts (Tr. 22).\nApplicant completed his December 26, 2006 security application. In that\napplication he answered \u201cno\u201d to section 28(a) and (b) which asks for information on\ndebts either 180 days delinquent in the last seven years or 90 days currently delinquent\n(GE 1 ).\nApplicant explained that he did not complete the security questionnaire by\nhimself in 2006.  He indicated that someone at the computer filled in the information that\nApplicant provided by pencil. Applicant believed he answered \u201cyes\u201d to debts delinquent\nfor 180 and not 90 days. However, the SF 86 does not have anything checked for either\nsection 28(a) or (b). Applicant testified that he did not see the completed questionnaire.\nHe did sign the document. He said it was a misunderstanding. He was credible in his\ntestimony that he had no intent to deceive the government. He is looking forward to a\ncareer with the shipyard and providing for his family. \nIn May 2007, Applicant was interviewed as part of the security clearance\nprocess. He explained his financial status and his delinquencies. He indicated that some\nof the debt occurred in 2004 and most recently in 2006 due to his wife\u2019s medical\nproblems and the birth of their son. He reiterated that he was the sole support for the\n\n4\npast two years. Applicant acknowledged that he bought a car at an auction and that he\nbecame delinquent because he was irresponsible at that time (2003). He also believed\nthat some of the bills may have been paid but he is not sure. He did not receive a bill for\nthe cable account and he had moved. He could not afford the payments on his vehicle\nand he returned the car to the dealership (GE 4). \nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n\n5\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set\nout in AG & 18:      \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to\nprotect classified information. An individual who is financially overextended\nis at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.\nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise\nsecurity concerns. Applicant accumulated delinquent debts on numerous accounts and\njudgments and did not meet some of his financial obligations from 2004 until the present\ntime. His credit reports confirm the debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise these\npotentially disqualifying conditions, requiring a closer examination.\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG \u00b6 20(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Athe behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or\noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt\non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.@ Applicant=s\nfinancial worries arose in 2004 and in 2006. He accumulated some delinquent debt due\nto his ex-fiancee. He later accumulated debt due to his wife\u2019s medical problems and the\nbirth of his son. He could not pay his bills on his salary alone. While those\ncircumstances may have precipitated the debt, the inquiry does not end at that point. He\nadmits that he was irresponsible prior to 2004. His conduct over the last six months with\nhis creditors and the financial counselor removes security concerns or doubts about his\ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. However, he made payments on\none debt in the SOR and has 13 outstanding delinquent debts. This potentially\nmitigating condition applies in part.\nUnder AG & 20(b), it may be mitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the\nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation),\n\n6\nand the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances.@ Applicant has been\nsteadily employed during the past five years. His wife\u2019s medical problems and the birth\nof their son combined with her inability to work until very recently contributed to his\nfinancial difficulties but he also admitted that he was irresponsible prior to his marriage.\nApplicant was not as aggressive as he should have been in initially addressing or\nresolving his delinquent debts. I find this potentially mitigating condition partially applies.\nEvidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem\nand/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under control@\nis potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c). Similarly, AG & 20(d) applies where the\nevidence shows Athe individual initiated a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or\notherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant is receiving financial counseling. He is investigating\nhis credit report through his debt counselor. He has been paying on one debt since\n2006. He is also paying on a furniture debt that is not listed in the SOR. He is current on\nhis daily expenses. His wife has recently returned to work. He is looking for a new place\nto live which he hopes will increase his monthly net remainder. I find his efforts are\nsufficient to carry his burden in this case. I conclude these potentially mitigating\nconditions apply.\nAG \u00b6 20(e) applies where the evidence shows \u201cthe individual has a reasonable\nbasis to dispute the legitimacy of the past due debt which is the cause of the problem\nand provides documented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.\u201d In this case, Applicant stated that his\ncounselor had identified some problems or possible duplications on his credit report. He\npresented a letter from his counselor. I conclude this potentially mitigating condition\npartially applies.\nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate with\nthe security clearance process.\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG \u00b6 16(a), \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any\npersonnel questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct\ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status,\ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary\nresponsibilities\u201d is potentially disqualifying.\n\n7\nIn this case, when Applicant completed his 2006 security application, he did not\nlist any debts that were 90 or 180 days delinquent. He explained that he did not\ncomplete the security application himself. I found his testimony credible that he believed\nhe told the person at the computer that he did have debts more than 180 days\ndelinquent and believed that encompassed the 90-day question. Despite the fact that\nthe questionnaire was not checked \u2018yes\u201d on either section, I found him credible. The\nallegation of falsification is unsubstantiated. He loves his job and the opportunity to\nprovide for his family and would not do anything to jeopardize that position. I do not find\nthat he deliberately provided false information on his SF 86 in 2006.\nThus, Applicant\u2019s allegation of deliberate omission is mitigated under AG 17(f)\n\u201cthe information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable reliability.\u201d\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):\n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and\nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate\ndetermination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance must\nbe an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case and conclude they are sufficient to\novercome the government\u2019s case. Applicant has worked very hard for the past five\nyears in his apprenticeship program. He is nearing completion and has a promotion\nahead of him. He is now married and has an infant son. His wife appeared with him at\nthe hearing and testified in his behalf. He was credible in that he realizes he was\nimmature after high school and made mistakes in financial responsibility. He is receiving\ncounseling and his wife is helping with the family expenses by her return to work.\nApplicant was very adamant in his resolve to clear his credit and pay all his bills. He is\ncurrent on his daily expenses and is looking for a way to increase his discretionary\nincome which he promises to apply to payment of his creditors.

The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on July 14, 2008. He answered the\nSOR in writing and requested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. I received the\ncase assignment on August 22, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on September\n3, 2008, and I convened the hearing on September 23, 2008. The Government offered\nExhibits (GE) 1-6, which were received without objection. Applicant testified in his own\nbehalf. He did not submit any exhibits. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing (Tr)\nOctober 24, 2008\n\n2\non September 30, 2008. Based upon a review of the case file, eligibility for access to\nclassified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his Answer to the SOR, dated July 14, 2008, Applicant admitted the factual\nallegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 2.a of the SOR. He denied the factual allegations in \u00b6 1.b.\nApplicant provided additional information to support his request for eligibility for a\nsecurity clearance. \nApplicant is a 23-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He graduated from\nhigh school in 2003. After high school, he completed college in 2006 (GE 1). Applicant\nis single and has no children. He has been employed with his current employer since\nNovember 2006 (Tr. 12). \nOn May 5, 2004, Applicant was arrested and charged with illegal selling/giving\nalcohol to minors. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 180 days of supervised\nprobation, and was fined (GE 2). Applicant claimed he has no recollection of this\nincident (Tr. 31). He explained that he does not understand how he could have been\ncharged with such an incident because he was a minor at the time. He could not answer\nany questions about the incident. At the hearing Applicant did not supply any\ninformation to explain the circumstances of the event. \nOn March 19, 2007, Applicant was charged and arrested for Driving Under the\nInfluence of Alcohol (first Offense), possession of an Open Container of Alcohol, and\nSpeeding. He pleaded guilty to the DUI charge. His sentence was deferred and he was\nplaced on 364 days of supervised probation. He was ordered to perform 24 hours of\ncommunity service and attend alcohol classes (GE 4). The remaining charges were\ndismissed. He successfully completed probation in March 2008.\nApplicant was required to complete an alcohol screening as a result of the March\n2007 incident. There was no recommendation for any treatment. He completed three\nalcohol classes by the end of July 2007 (GE 3).\nAs part of a requirement for a driver\u2019s license, Applicant was ordered to have an\nignition interlock installed on his motor vehicle. He had the ignition interlock installed in\nMay 2007. The interlock restriction was ordered for one year. On several occasions he\ntried to drive his car when he had been drinking (Tr. 27).\nOn May 7, 2007, Applicant competed his security clearance application (SF 86).\nHe answered \u201cYes\u201d to section 23(d): Your Police Record. He listed a March 2007 DUI\nconviction but did not list the May 2004 conviction for illegally selling/giving alcohol to\nminors. He claimed that he forgot about the incident and in the alternative that he was a\nminor and does not believe he could be charged with such an offense.\n\n3\nIn June 2007, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator. He acknowledged\nthat he has approximately eight or ten outstanding traffic tickets for speeding (GE 2). He\nadmits that they are unpaid and have been for a \u201clong time\u201d (Tr. 47).\nAt the hearing, Applicant could not recall how many times he was arrested as a\nyoung man in high school nor how many times he was in jail for partying or fighting (Tr.\n22). He acknowledged drinking in high school and that his drinking increased somewhat\nafter he turned 21 years of age. He would go out and drink with his friends on\nweekends. He stated that his DWI arrest made him aware that he has to exercise better\njudgment and he does not plan to drink and drive in the future (Tr. 20).\nOn August 12, 2007, Applicant received a letter reminding him that a warrant for\nhis arrest was outstanding. In his written interrogatories in October 2007, he explained\nthat: \u201cI completely forgot about the earlier arrest until August 12, 2007 when [I] received\na letter of reminder. It\u2019s hard for me to remember fines I got in 2004. I am sorry.\u201d The\n2007 incident was for failure to pay a fine (GE 2.) Then at the hearing Applicant said he\nlearned about the 2004 incident when he tried to get his license renewed. He was told\nthat he could not get another license until he had paid a fine from the 2004 incident (Tr.\n33). \nApplicant explained he requested the hearing because he needs the security\nclearance for his current job. He enjoys his work and wants to progress in the company\n(Tr. 49). He was vague about his lack of memory but did not deny that the incident\noccurred because it was on his record ( Tr. 14). He said he feels bad about the situation\nand is sorry. He insists he would have put it down if he had remembered it. He wavered\nin his responses about when he actually learned about the 2004 incident and why he did\nnot list it on his security application (Tr. 39). He started to explain it occurred in one\nlocation because the court was located in a place other than where he lived.\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2,\nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the\n\u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, reliable\ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a\ndecision.\n\n4\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis\nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in\nAG & 30, \u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness\nto comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d\nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under\nAG & 31(a), a Asingle serious crime or multiple lesser offenses@ may be potentially\ndisqualifying.  Similarly under AG & 31(c), Aallegation or admission of criminal conduct,\nregardless of whether the person was formally charged or convicted@ may raise security\nconcerns. As noted above, Applicant was arrested and charged with alcohol incidents in\n2004 and 2007. He pleaded guilty to the charge in 2004. He was convicted of DUI in\n2007. These facts are sufficient to raise these potentially disqualifying conditions,\nrequiring a closer examination.\n\n5\nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns arising from criminal conduct. Under AG \u00b6 32(a), the disqualifying condition\nmay be mitigated where Aso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior\nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good\njudgment.@ Applicant=s criminal conduct occurred in 2004 and 2007. He completed\nsupervised probation in March 2008. His citation for violation of the interlock after his\nDUI was in 2007. The repeated incidents create some doubt about Applicant\u2019s\njudgment. This potentially mitigating condition does not apply in this case. \nUnder AG & 30(d), it may be mitigating where Athere is evidence of successful\nrehabilitation; including, but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of\ncriminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good\nemployment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d As noted above, Applicant\nhas been employed since 2006 with his current employer. He completed his community\nservice and his probation very recently. He admits he still has unpaid traffic tickets. I find\nthis potentially mitigating condition partially applies in this case. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct\nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in\nAG \u00b6 15:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate with\nthe security clearance process.\nAG 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be\ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable:\n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from\nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar\nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications,\naward benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or untrust\nworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;\nIn May 2007, Applicant completed his security clearance application. His\nresponse to section 23(d) Your Police Record listed his 2007 DUI. He did not list a 2004\nguilty plea for selling/giving alcohol to minors. He claims he has no recollection of the\nevent. He also states that he does not understand how he could have been charged wit\nthis because he was a minor at the time. Applicant stated in his 2007 interrogatories\nthat he remembered the incident when he received the letter for the outstanding bench\nwarrant for his arrest. Upon questioning at the hearing, Applicant could not recall how\n\n6\nmany times he was in court or arrested for things such as fighting or drinking. At the\nhearing, he admitted he could not deny that the incident occurred.\nApplicant\u2019s different statements concerning the 2004 incident and his inability to\nremember the incident do not make him credible. I find that he deliberately omitted the\ninformation from his security clearance application because he was concerned about\ngetting his security clearance. \n .\nParagraph 17 lists conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Specifically, AG \u00b6\n17 states:\n(a) \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission,\nconcealment or falsification before being confronted with the facts;\n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so\ninfrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to\nrecur and does not case doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgement. \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to\nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors,\ncircumstances or factors that caused untrustworthy, unreliable, or other\ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur.\u201d\n \nAfter considering these mitigating conditions, I find that none of them apply in this\ncase. Applicant has not mitigated the personal conduct concerns through his recent\nactions and behavior. \nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which\nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other\npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for\npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or\nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility\nfor a security clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon\ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all\nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has been arrested twice in\n\n7\nthe last four years. The incidents in 2004 and 2007 involve alcohol. He was convicted\nand only recently completed probation in March 2008. He also had a violation of his\nignition interlock after the conviction. Applicant was vague and confusing in his\ntestimony at the hearing. He was not credible in his lack of recollection of the 2004\nincident. \nOverall, the record evidence and whole person analysis leaves me with questions\nand doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all\nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns arising from\nhis personal conduct and criminal conduct. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a-b:\nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied.\n                                              \n_________________\nNOREEN A. LYNCH\nAdministrative Judge\n",

While stationed there he \nhad two adulterous relationships, each lasting approximately one year. He began a third \nadulterous relationship in 1992 with Woman C. He transferred from the Philippines in \nMay 1993. All three of the women Applicant had relationship with were Philippine \nnationals. When Applicant transferred from the Philippines to North Carolina, Woman C \napplied for and was granted a visitor\u2019s visa to the U.S. Applicant continued his \nrelationship with her. He paid for her airfare to come to the U.S. in 1993. She moved to \nthe same area where Applicant was stationed. She lived with friends while in the U.S. \nand obtained a job.2 Applicant stated he gave her money every now and then. He was \nstationed in North Carolina from 1993-1996.3  \n \nIn February 1996, Applicant and his family were transferred to California. Woman \nC moved to Texas, but continued her relationship with Applicant by meeting him for \nvacations in New Orleans. Woman C\u2019s visa expired and she remained in the U.S. \nillegally. Applicant was aware that she was in the U.S. illegally. In Woman\u2019s C\u2019s written \nstatement she admitted she found it difficult to get a job or have a normal life. She \nwanted to get her green card which would allow her to remain in the U.S. legally and \ntravel back to the Philippines to see her family. While living in Texas she told Applicant \n \n1 Tr. 28-29. \n \n2 It is unclear how she could obtain a job when she was in the U.S. on a visitor\u2019s visa and without \na green card.  \n \n3 Tr. 29-35. \n\n3 \n \n                                                          \nshe had met somebody that was a U.S. citizen who could help her with her immigration \nproblems and that she was dating him and might marry him.4 \n \n \nDuring this period of time, Applicant was the financial management officer for a \nNaval Hospital. He had been promoted to Lieutenant Commander (0-4). He stated that \nwhile on a \u201csmoke break\u201d he asked Seaman J if he would be willing to marry his \ngirlfriend. This seaman did not work directly for Applicant, but did work in the hospital. \nApplicant specifically targeted Seaman J, because like Applicant, he was a Filipino. \nSeaman J\u2019s statement reflected that he met Applicant while he was working in the \nhuman resource department and told him he came into the Navy to go to college. After \nhe had known Applicant for about a month, Seaman J\u2019s statement said Applicant called \nhim one afternoon and asked him to come to his office after work to discuss something. \nSeaman J agreed and went to his office. They spoke in the work area outside \nApplicant\u2019s office. It was after hours and no other workers were present. Applicant told \nSeaman J that he needed his help and asked him if he wanted to make some money for \ncollege. Applicant explained he had a girlfriend from the Philippines that needed help \nstaying in the U.S. so she could help her family in the Philippines. Applicant advised \nSeaman J that he could make extra money on the side by marrying her and he would \nbe entitled to married housing allowance and when he became a U.S. citizen he could \npetition to grant her U.S. citizenship status.5 Applicant asked Seaman J to do this for \nhim. Seaman J told Applicant that he did not think it was a good idea, but Applicant \nasked him to think about doing it. About a month later, Applicant contacted Seaman J \nagain in his office and asked him if he had been thinking about the offer. Seaman J \nagain told him that he had a bad feeling about it and Applicant told him that he should \ntrust Applicant. In about March 1996, Seaman J told Applicant that he would help him.6 \n \nApplicant told Woman C that he knew a Navy man who would be willing to marry \nher to help with her immigration problems. In early 1996, Woman C flew to California \nand Applicant met her at the airport. He took her to stay with a family he knew.  \n \nIn approximately April 1996, after Seaman J agreed to help, Applicant contacted \nhim and told him he had set a date for Seaman J to marry his girlfriend. Applicant \npicked him up at the barracks and drove to an automatic teller machine. Applicant \nretrieved some money. They then drove to the Officers\u2019 Club and picked up Applicant\u2019s \ngirlfriend. The three of them went to the court house and they filled out the paper work \nfor a marriage license. Applicant gave Seaman J the money for the license. After \nreceiving the license, Applicant then drove them to a wedding chapel and Seaman J \n \n4 Tr. 36-43, 53- 54; GE 5 and 6. \n \n5 Apparently SN J was not a U.S. citizen.  \n \n6 Tr. 18, 35-46, 55-57, GE 5 and 6. I did not find Applicant\u2019s testimony credible when he testified \nthat the seaman never expressed any hesitation and he only asked him one time to participate in the \nscheme. This is contrary to Seaman J\u2019s written statement.  \n \n\n4 \n \n                                                          \nmarried Woman C. The three then left and Applicant returned Seaman J to his barracks \nand Woman C to the Officers\u2019 Club.7 \n \nApproximately a week after Seaman J and Woman C married, Applicant \ncontacted Seaman J and told him that Woman C was coming to the hospital to get her \nmilitary dependents identification card and to start the paperwork for the married \nhousing allowance. Seaman J met her and she signed the necessary paperwork \npresenting the marriage license. This was the last time Seaman J saw Woman C, his \nwife. Neither intended the other to be an actual marital partner.  \n \nIn September 1996, Applicant again contacted Seaman J and told him that he \nwanted him to come to his office to talk to him. Seaman J went to Applicant\u2019s office after \nwork and Applicant told him that Woman C was coming to live near the base and \nApplicant wanted Seaman J to sign paperwork for an apartment because that would \nmake it look as though she and Seaman J were living together. Seaman J agree to do \nthis and several days later he went to Applicant\u2019s office after work and Applicant drove \nhim to the apartment and he signed the paperwork.  \n \n \nIn early December 1996, Applicant again contacted Seaman J and told him he \nneeded $250 for the apartment rent and Seaman J gave him a check for that amount \ndrawn on his personal account. This was the only money he paid. Later Applicant called \nhim and told him that he was going to put Woman C on Seaman J\u2019s Navy Federal \nCredit Union (NFCU) account, so Seaman J gave him the account number. The next \nday an employee of NFCU contacted Seaman J\u2019s father and advised him that Woman C \nhad attempted to put herself on Seaman J\u2019s account.8 Seaman J\u2019s father asked him \nabout it and he told him the whole story.9 \n \n \nSeaman J also stated in his written statement that Applicant had asked him on \nseveral occasions how his citizenship application was progressing, because he wanted \nSeaman J to apply for citizenship for Woman C\u2019s as soon as he could.10 Applicant \nstated he could not remember if he asked Seaman J to petition for his wife to become a \nU.S. citizen after he did. He stated: \u201cIt\u2019s possible, but I don\u2019t remember.\u201d11 \n \n7 Tr. 72; GE 5 and 6. Applicant stated he could not remember if he was the witness at the \nwedding, or that he drove the couple to get married, or that he paid for the marriage license, or that he \nhelped Woman C get her military dependents identification card, or that he had Seaman J sign the \napartment lease. He stated he is not denying that he did those things, he just could not remember. I did \nnot find Applicant\u2019s testimony credible.  \n \n8 Seaman J\u2019s NFCU\u2019s account was through his father. When NFCU contacted Seaman J\u2019s father \nhe was unaware that he had gotten married.  \n \n9 Tr. 58-61, 74. Applicant\u2019s testimony was contrary to Seaman J\u2019s statement. Applicant denied \nattempting to put Woman C on Seaman J\u2019s Navy Federal Credit Union account. I did not find his \ntestimony credible.  \n \n10 GE 5. \n \n11 Tr. 70-72. Applicant stated he could not remember the exact details of some of the issues. \nAlthough he did not deny that he could have said certain things, he stated he could not recall. \n\n5 \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant testified that he was aware of Woman C\u2019s illegal immigration status. He \nadmitted he was attempting to have her remain in the country illegally. His relationship \nwith her lasted until 1997 when his affair and the scheme were discovered.12 He last \nhad contact with her in 1998. He admitted he was not the one to come forward, but the \noffenses were found out when Seaman J\u2019s father reported the offense. Applicant was \ncharged with (1) conspiracy to make and present a false claim against the government \n(2) sodomy; (3) making and presenting a fraudulent claim against the government; and \n(4) conduct unbecoming an officer. Applicant pled guilty to the offenses at a court-\nmartial. He was sentenced to a Dismissal, confinement for six months, a fine of $5,000, \nand a reprimand. On appeal charges (1) and (3) were considered multiplicious with the \ncourse of conduct in charge (4) and were dismissed. The court found the sentence was \nstill appropriate.13 Applicant admitted that he did conspire to defraud the government.14 \n \n \nApplicant admitted he was investigated in about 1993 for fraudulent use of a \ngovernment credit card. No other evidence was provided to show any offense was \ncommitted by Applicant. \n \n \nApplicant had a security clearance at the time of the offenses. He knew adultery \nwas an offense and was aware of his girlfriend\u2019s immigration status and he was \nattempting to thwart the immigration laws.15 Applicant testified he is a changed man and \nno longer a womanizer. Applicant testified he could not remember many of the specifics \nof the acts that he committed as provided in the written statements by Woman C and \nSeaman J. He did not deny his conduct. He is remorseful for his actions. He believes he \npaid for his actions and was disgraced. He has worked in the private sector since \nserving his sentence. He provided character letters from supervisors who knew of his \npast and consider him trustworthy, loyal and competent. He is considered a trusted \nadvisor with unparalleled work ethic who is dedicated and eager to accept \nresponsibilities, accountability and stewardship of Government funding actions.16  \n \nPolicies \n \nPositions designated as ADP I and ADP II are classified as \u201csensitive positions.\u201d  \n(See Regulation \u00b6\u00b6 C3.1.2.1.1.7 and C3.1.2.1.2.3.)  \u201cThe standard that must be met for \n. . . assignment to sensitive duties is that, based on all available information, the \nperson\u2019s loyalty, reliability, and trustworthiness are such that . . . assigning the person to \nsensitive duties is clearly consistent with the interests of national security.\u201d (See \nRegulation \u00b6 C6.1.1.1.) The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence \nand Security) Memorandum, dated November 19, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA by the Defense Security Service \n \n12 Tr. 62-64. \n \n13 GE 4. \n \n14 Tr. 59-60 \n \n15 Tr. 64. \n \n16 Tr. 20; GE 3. \n\n6 \n \nand Office of Personnel Management.  Department of Defense contractor personnel are \nafforded the right to the procedures contained in the Directive before any final \nunfavorable access determination may be made. (See Regulation \u00b6 C8.2.1.)   \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the \nAG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n[sensitive] information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable \ntrustworthiness decision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to sensitive information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard sensitive information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nsensitive information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty \nof the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \n \n \n \n\n7 \n \nAnalysis \nCriminal Conduct \n \nParagraph 30 of the adjudicative guidelines sets out the trustworthiness concern \nrelating to criminal conduct: ACriminal activity creates doubt about a person=s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person=s ability \nor willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.@ \n \nI have considered all of the criminal conduct disqualifying conditions and \nespecially considered AG \u00b6 31(a) (\u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d); \n(b) (\u201cdischarge or dismissal from the Armed Force\u2019s under dishonorable conditions\u201d); \nand (c) (\u201can allegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nperson was formally charged, formally prosecuted or convicted\u201d). Applicant conspired \nand perpetrated a fraud on the government to thwart immigration laws. He had \nadulterous relationships while a married man while serving as an officer in the Navy. He \nsolicited an enlisted person to commit a fraud on the government through a sham \nmarriage. Applicant was court-martialed, went to jail and was dismissed from the Navy. I \nfind all of the above disqualifying conditions apply under these facts.  \n\u00a0\n \nI have also considered the criminal conduct mitigating conditions and especially \nconsidered AG 32 \u00b6 (a) (\u201cso much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual  circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment\u201d) and (d) (\u201cthere is evidence of successful rehabilitation, including but not \nlimited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, remorse or \nrestitution, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive \ncommunity involvement\u201d). It has been 11 years since Applicant completed his sentence. \nHe has a good job and is a valued employee who is trusted. He is remorseful for his \nactions and stated he is no longer a womanizer. Both of the above mitigating conditions \napply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a public trust position by considering the totality of the \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should \nconsider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, \nextent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, \nto include knowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a public trust position must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \n\n8 \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant was an officer in the Navy, \nmarried, holding a security clearance, and in a position of trust. He preyed on and \ntargeted a young sailor because he was a Filipino and needed money. He arranged a \nsham marriage so his girlfriend, who was in the U.S. illegally, could remain. He \ndisregarded the seriousness of the U.S. immigration laws, he abused his position of \ntrust as an officer and husband, and through his actions he defrauded the government. \nApplicant\u2019s actions were not a one time occurrence. To the contrary his exploits \nexpanded over six years and did not stop until he was eventually caught. He took many \nsteps to advance his own personal agenda, including buying the marriage license and \ntaking Seaman J and Woman C to the chapel to be married. He then took her to get her \nmilitary dependents identification card, to sign an apartment lease and then attempted \nto place her on Seaman J\u2019s bank account. During Applicant\u2019s continuing course of \nmisconduct he held a security clearance and was in a position of trust as an officer and \nthe financial officer for a naval hospital. He is remorse for all he lost due to his actions \nand the disgrace he brought to himself and his family. It has been many years since the \nconduct occurred. I have considered all of the issues in mitigation and conclude that \nthey do not outweigh the gravity of Applicant\u2019s conduct. He abused his position of trust \nfor his personal pleasure; he willingly sacrificed his honor and the trust he was given as \na naval officer; he repeatedly violated his marital vows with several women over many \nyears; it was at his suggestion that a sham marriage occurred and he continued to \nperpetuate the criminal activity involved in it. He took action to have an illegal immigrant \ngain access to benefits afforded to military dependents. He had Seaman J sign for an \napartment lease and Applicant attempted to have his girlfriend be made a joint owner of \na bank account. He was the moving force behind all of this criminal conduct. Although \nhe is a model employee and a significant period of time has past, it does not outweigh \nhis continuing course of misconduct and the years he spent violating those who trusted \nhim. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising from his criminal \nconduct.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n9 \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a public trust \nposition.

No other information was provided regarding \naspects of his work. Applicant\u2019s aunt, prior to retiring, worked for a Chinese government \nowned hospital. No information was provided as to how Applicant\u2019s brother or uncle are \nemployed. Applicant did not provide any additional information about his family \nmembers. It is unknown how long they each worked in their respective employment. \nPresumably they each receive a pension from the Chinese government.1  \n \n \n1 Answer to SOR; Item 5. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \n \nApplicant traveled to China to visit his family in April 2004 to May 2004, for \napproximately two weeks to attend his brother\u2019s wedding. He again traveled to China in \nAugust 2007 to September 2007, for approximately three weeks. His mother was sick at \nthe time. No other information was provided about Applicant\u2019s brother or his wife or her \nfamily. Applicant believes his brother lives with his parents. He also believes his brother \ndisappeared from the family in around 2005. He believes he went through some type of \ntrauma. He does not know the specifics. The family did not where his brother was when \nhe disappeared. The brother reappeared a year later. No further information was \nprovided regarding his brother\u2019s mysterious disappearance. Applicant disputes he \ntraveled to China in October 2004.2  \n \n \nApplicant acknowledges he attended various parties hosted by the Chinese \nEmbassy in Washington D.C. He estimated he attended a total of three to four holiday \ncelebrations hosted by the embassy. He would receive the invitation through a coworker \nor a friend. He stated he did not have any additional contact with the Chinese Embassy \ndirectly before or after the parties. He stated in his Answer to the SOR that the last \nevent he attended was two or three years ago for a Chinese New Year party. This \nwould mean that he attended the party after becoming a U.S. citizen.3  \n \n \nApplicant provided minimal information about his contacts in China. It is unknown \nwhether he has any property interests or financial interests in China. Applicant claimed \nhe contacts his parents about once or twice a year.4 \n \nPeople\u2019s Republic of China   \n \n \nChina is a large and economically powerful country, with a population of over a \nbillion people and an economy growing at about 10% per year. China has an \nauthoritarian government, dominated by the Chinese Communist Party. China has a \npoor record with respect to human rights, suppresses political dissent, and its practices \ninclude arbitrary arrest and detention, forced confessions, torture, and mistreatment of \nprisoners.  \n \nChina is one of the most aggressive countries in targeting sensitive and \nprotected U.S. technology, and economic intelligence. It has targeted the U.S. with \nactive intelligence gathering programs, both legal and illegal. In China, authorities have \nmonitored telephone conversations, facsimile transmissions, e-mail, text messaging, \nand internet communications. Authorities opened and censored mail. The security \nservices routinely monitored and entered residences and offices to gain access to \ncomputers, telephones, and fax machines. All major hotels had a sizable internal \nsecurity presence, and hotel guestrooms were sometimes bugged and searched for \nsensitive or proprietary materials. \n \n \n \n2 Id. \n3 Id. His Answer to the SOR is dated April 1, 2008. \n4 Id. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 7: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism. \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. Four are potentially applicable in this case:   \n \n(a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional \nassociate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident in a \nforeign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to \nhelp a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information.  \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother, father, brother, aunt, and uncle are citizens and residents of \nChina. His parents and aunt all worked for Chinese government owned entities and are \nretired, presumably receiving some type of Chinese government pension. Applicant \ntraveled to China as recently as 2007. He attended his brother\u2019s wedding and visited \nwhen his mother was sick. He attended parties at the Chinese Embassy in the past two \nor three years, which would have been after he became a U.S. citizen. China has an \nauthoritarian government, dominated by the Communist Party, with a poor human rights \nrecord, and targets the U.S. for espionage. Applicant\u2019s foreign connections create a \nheightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nThey also create a potential conflict of interest. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) have been raised \nby the evidence.  \n \nConditions that could mitigate Foreign Influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8:  \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; \n \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation; \n \n(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or \nare approved by the cognizant security authority; \n \n(e) the individual has promptly complied with existing agency requirements \nregarding the reporting of contacts, requests, or threats from persons, \ngroups, or organizations from a foreign country; and \n \n(f) the value or routine nature of the foreign business, financial, or property \ninterests is such that they are unlikely to result in a conflict and could not \nbe used effectively to influence, manipulate, or pressure the individual. \n \n \nApplicant failed to provide enough information about his relatives, travels and \nChinese contacts to meet his burden of mitigating the security concerns raised by \nforeign influence. He failed to provide any information as to what his property interests \nare in China or the U.S. The record is silent as to whether Applicant visited any of his \nrelatives, other than his mother, when he was in China in 2007. He failed to elaborate \non his relationship with his brother or his mysterious disappearance. It is clear he still \nmaintains his family relations in China and has visited them for family events, such as a \nwedding and when his mother was sick. Applicant has been in the U.S. since 1989, but \nonly a citizen since 2005, a relatively short period of time. He has not met his burden to \nconvince me that his contact with China and his relatives are minimal and that he has \nsuch deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties to the U.S. that he can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. Based on his \nrelationships and ties with his family in China, which are more than casual and the \nnature of that foreign country, I am unable to find any of the mitigating conditions \napplicable.  \n \n \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation \nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has been a naturalized \nU.S. citizen since 2005. He has family ties to China and failed to provide sufficient \ninformation to mitigate the foreign influence security concerns raised. He has attended \nparties at the Chinese Embassy, but not fully elaborated on his contacts while in \nattendance. Overall the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from foreign \ninfluence.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.g: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nCarol G.

The Applicant is 53 years of age and married. He is employed as a translator/linguist or interpreter for a defense contractor. He seeks a security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense industry. Paragraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence). The Government alleges in this paragraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign contacts that could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise of classified information. The Applicant was born in Arbil, Iraq. This area of Iraq is called the \u201cKurdistan Region\u201d because it is located in the north and is controlled by the Kurds. In 1975, the Applicant left Iraq and moved to Canada where he studied English. Although he wanted to come directly to the United States, he did not have permission to do so. In early 1978, at the age of 23, the Applicant snuck into the United States illegally. He was arrested and spent about a week in jail for illegal entry. He told United States officials that he was a \u201cKurd\u201d and he was seeking asylum in the United States because of the persecutions by Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime. The Applicant was granted a I-94 Visa with permission to work, and was allowed to stay in the United States. He ultimately applied for amnesty and was granted an alien card. He became a naturalized United States",

Goldstein, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: William F. Savarino, Esquire\nSeptember 29, 2008\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLOKEY ANDERSON, Darlene D., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant submitted his Questionnaire for National Security Positions, on August\n31, 2007.  On February 20, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guideline\nB for Applicant.  The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding\nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of\nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review\nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive), and the revised adjudicative\nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective\nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on a March 22, 2008, and requested a\nhearing before an Administrative Judge.  The case was assigned to another\nAdministrative Judge on June 25, 2008. The matter was transferred to the undersigned\non July 7, 2008.  A notice of hearing on July 16, 2008, and the hearing was held on\nAugust 8, 2008. The Government presented two exhibits, referred to as Government\nExhibits 1 and 2,  which were received without objection.  Applicant presented three\nexhibits, referred to as Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A through C, which were received without\nobjection.  The Applicant testified on his own behalf.  DOHA received the transcript of\nthe hearing (Tr.) on August 14, 2008.  Based upon a review of the case file, pleadings,\nexhibits, and testimony, eligibility for access to classified information is granted.\n\n2\nRequest for Administrative Notice\nDepartment Counsel submitted a formal request that I take administrative notice\nof certain facts concerning the current political conditions in Iraq, Syria and Jordan.\nApplicant had no objection.  (Tr. p. 18 ).  The request and the attached documents were\nnot admitted into evidence, but were included in the record. The facts administratively\nnoticed are set out in the Findings of Fact, below. \nFINDINGS OF FACT\nThe following Findings of Fact are based on Applicant's Answer to the SOR, the\ntestimony and the exhibits.  The Applicant is 53 years of age and married.  He is\nemployed as a translator/linguist or interpreter for a defense contractor.  He seeks a\nsecurity clearance in connection with his employment in the defense industry.\nParagraph 1 (Guideline B - Foreign Influence).  The Government alleges in this\nparagraph that the Applicant is ineligible for clearance because he has foreign contacts\nthat could create the potential for foreign influence that could result in the compromise\nof classified information.\nThe Applicant was born in Arbil, Iraq.  This area of Iraq is called the \u201cKurdistan\nRegion\u201d because it is located in the north and is controlled by the Kurds.  In 1975, the\nApplicant left Iraq and moved to Canada where he studied English.  Although he wanted\nto come directly to the United States, he did not have permission to do so.  In early\n1978, at the age of 23, the Applicant snuck into the United States illegally.  He was\narrested and spent about a week in jail for illegal entry.  He told United States officials\nthat he was a \u201cKurd\u201d and he was seeking asylum in the United States because of the\npersecutions by Saddam Hussein\u2019s regime.  The Applicant was granted a I-94 Visa with\npermission to work, and was allowed to stay in the United States.  He ultimately applied\nfor amnesty and was granted an alien card.  He became a naturalized United States\ncitizen in May 1995.  \nThe Applicant married a relative of his from Iraq in May 1997.  She obtained her\nnaturalized United States citizenship in 2003 or 2004.  They have two children who are\nnative born American citizens.  The Applicant\u2019s wife has a sister and her husband that\nreside in the United States.  They are currently green card holders awaiting eligibility to\napply for citizenship.   \nFrom 1997 through 2003, the Applicant operated and owned a 7-Eleven\nfranchise.  In 2003, he wanted to help the United States in their effort to liberate Iraq.\nTwo of the Applicant\u2019s brother\u2019s had been tortured by Saddam Husseins regime, one of\nwhom was sentenced to death, the other was imprisoned by security forces and beaten\nfor ten continuous days for being \u201cKurds\u201d.  The Applicant, with a deep desire to help the\nUnited States against the regime in Iraq, applied for and obtained a job as a linguist.  He\nalso applied for a security clearance and was granted an interim clearance in 2003.\nFrom April 2003, to 2008, the Applicant was assigned to work in Iraq for the United\nStates Army.  He traveled to Kuwait several times in 2003, and also to Qatar in 2005.\n\n3\nWithout saying more, the Applicant is essentially the eyes and ears for the military.  (Tr.\np. 55).  The Applicant\u2019s job is dangerous.  In the past, the Applicant has been shot at\nand had weapons launched in his direction.  Applicant testified that it was common\nknowledge in Iraq that the bounty on a soldier was $25,000.00 and the bounty on an\ninterpreter was $50,000.00 because they are considered traitors.  (Tr. p. 67).  All of the\nApplicant\u2019s work associates are United States citizens.       \nThe Applicant has a number of relatives who are citizens and residents of Iraq.\nBoth his mother and father are deceased.  He has four brothers.  One of his brothers is\na citizen and resident of Iraq.  He is a lawyer who is managing family land that was\ninherited.  Another brother is a citizen of Iraq who resides in Canada.  He and the\nApplicant do not get along, and the Applicant does not know what he does for a living.\nHe has two brothers who are citizens of Iraq, but who are residents of Germany.  One of\nthem lives between Germany and the \u201cKurdish region\u201d and is collecting unemployment\nfrom Germany.  The other brother is on the welfare system in Germany.  The Applicant\nhas not communicated with him since 1996.  \nThe Applicant has five sisters.  One of his sisters is a citizen of Iraq, but resides\nin Germany.  She works for the newsstand.  Her spouse is a member of the Kurdish\nparliament in Iraq who has assisted the United States Government in their mission.  He\nhas a sister who is a citizen of Iraq that resides in England.  She is a homemaker.  He\nhas a sister who is a citizen of Iraq who resides in Germany.  The Applicant does not\nknow what she does for a living.  He has a sister who is a resident of Syria who is a\ncitizen of Iraq.  She is married to a farmer who has citrus fields.  The Applicant has not\nspoken to her since 2002.  He has a sister who is a citizen of Iraq who resides in\nJordan.  She works for the United Nations, UNICEF.  Her husband lives with her but he\nis unemployed.  \nThe Applicant has a father-in-law who is a citizen and resident of Iraq.  He is a\nfarmer.  His son, the Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law, is also a farmer.  He has a sister-in-law\nwho is  living in California and babysitting for a living.  His mother-in-law is deceased.\nThe Applicant has two brother-in-laws.  One of them works for an American company in\nIraq.  The other one resides in Germany and works for a janitorial service.  Both are\nmarried to women who are homemakers.  The Applicant also has two sisters-in-law who\nare both housewives.  The Applicant\u2019s relatives do not know what he does for a living\nbecause he has not told them.  \nThe Applicant used to speak to several of his relatives in Iraq about once a\nmonth or once every other month to his relatives until he received the SOR, when he\nceased all communications/contact whatsoever.  He has no intent of resuming any\ncontact with his foreign relatives while he is employed in his present capacity.  In the\nevent that he is contacted by them or any one else for any reason that is not\nappropriate, he will report it to his unit.    \nThe Applicant\u2019s wife speaks to her 80 year old father on a monthly basis and on\noccasion to her brother in Iraq.  In the past, she has sent medicine to her father.  \nFrom 1992 to 1996, the Applicant traveled to Iraq or what he refers to as\n\u201coccupied Kurdishstan\u201d on five or six occasions.  From 1995 to 2002, the Applicant did\n\n4\nnot travel to Iraq at all.  Applicant traveled to Syria in 2002, and then from Syria to Iraq\nto pick up his wife and children who were visiting their grandmother, his mother-in-law\nwho had cancer, and had not seen her daughter since 1997.  By traveling to Syria and\nthen into Iraq the Applicant was able to avoid problems because it was controlled by the\nKurdish regions and he would not be in danger.  The Applicant used his United States\npassport to travel.\nAll of the Applicant\u2019s financial assets are located in the United States.  His assets\ninclude two houses, a business partnership, bank accounts and a hundred thousand\ndollars in cash. \nLetters of recommendation from high ranking military officers with whom the\nApplicant has worked indicate that the Applicant\u2019s work performance has been\noutstanding.  His linguistic skills, cultural advice, knowledge of the area and\nunderstanding of Arab and Persian perceptions and attitudes toward United States\npolicy objectives been key to their successful mission.  The Applicant has been a critical\nstrategic asset and a valuable member of their team and is highly recommended for\nfuture positions of responsibility with the Department of Defense.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit\nA).    \nApplicant received several Certificates of Achievement from the Commander of\nhis unit.  They are in recognition of his untiring efforts and the performance of his duties\nfor the Department of Defense.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B).\n \nNumerous affidavits from soldiers who have worked with the Applicant in Iraq as\nwell as other Linguists who work for the Department of Defense attest to the Applicant\u2019s\nhardworking, dependable, responsible, honest and effective nature.  He considers\nhimself like a soldier defending the United States in his capacity as a linguist for the\nmilitary.  He has helped to bridge the cultural difference by teaching American deployed\nto Iraq the subtleties of working with the locals.  His efforts have helped to ensure the\nsafety of our troops and the successful operation of the mission.  (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit C).\n      \nIt is appropriate to discuss the relationship between Iraq, and to a lesser extent\nSyria and Jordan, and the United States at this time.  With regard to Iraq, in 2003, a\nUnited States led coalition removed Saddam Hussein and his Ba\u2019athist regime from\npower.  In March 2006, Iraq\u2019s new government took office after being freely elected by\nthe Iraqi people.  However, violence continues to engulf the country.  This violence has\nbeen fueled and perpetrated by Al Qaida terrorists, Sunni insurgents, and Shiite militias\nand death squads.  The State Department has specifically stated that: \u201cThe risk of\nterrorism directed against United States citizens and interests in Iraq remains extremely\nhigh\u201d.  Furthermore, the State Department has posted the following warning: \u201cAttacks\nagainst military and civilian targets through Iraq continue, including in the International\n(or \u201cGreen\u201d) Zone.  Targets include hotels, restaurants, police stations, checkpoints,\nforeign diplomatic missions, and international organizations and other locations with\nexpatriate personnel. Such attacks can occur at any time.\u201d  Kidnappings still occur: the\nmost recent kidnapping of an American citizen occurred in August 2007.  There are\nUnited States substantiated reports of human rights abuses, including a \u201cpervasive\nclimate of violence; misappropriation of official authority by sectarian, criminal and\ninsurgent groups; arbitrary deprivation of life; disappearances; torture and other cruel,\ninhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\u201d   \n\n5\nSyria, since March 1963, has been ruled by an authoritarian regime.  Syria is\ncurrently included on the Department of State\u2019s list of State Sponsors of Terrorism due\nto the presence of several terrorist groups in Syria.  According to the Department of\nState, the Syrian Government continues to provide political and material support to\nHezbollah and Palestinian terrorist groups.  Several terrorist groups base their external\nleadership and maintain offices in Damascus.  In addition Syria permits Iran to transfer\nweapons and supplies through Syria to Hezbollah in Lebanon.  United States officials\ncriticized Syria for permitting shipments of arms from Iran to Hezbollah in Lebanon that\nfueled the conflict between Lebanon and Israel in July 2006.  Similarly, Syria is \u201cone of\nthe primary transit points for foreign fighters entering Iraq.  The preliminary findings of a\nUN investigation have indicated that the Syrian Government was involved in the\nFebruary 2005 assignation of former Lebanese Prime Minister Hariri, who actively\nopposed Syria\u2019s influence on Lebanese political affairs.  A travel warning is in effect for\nSyria following September 12, 2006, attacks on the United States Embassy in\nDamascus.  In 1998 and 2000, mobs in Damascus attacked the United States\nAmbassador\u2019s Residence and the United States Embassy respectively.  Due to Syria\u2019s\nactive and passive support of terrorism in the Middle East, President Bush signed an\nexecutive order implementing sanctions on May 11, 2004.  These sanctions prohibit the\nexport to Syria of products of the United States other than food or medicine, and prohibit\nany commercial aircraft owned or controlled by the Syrian Government from taking off\nfrom or landing in the United States.  The Department of State describes the Syrian\nGovernment\u2019s human rights record as \u201cworsened.\u201d  The following human rights abuses\nhave been documented by the State Department as occurring in Syria: absence of right\nto change government, arbitrary or unlawful deprivation of life, torture in prison, poor\nprison conditions, arbitrary arrests and detentions, absence of rule of law, severely\nrestricted civil liberties, limited freedom of religion, government corruption and lack of\ntransparency, and violence against women.  \nJordan is a small country located in the Middle East with a constitutional\nmonarchy and a developing economy.  Jordan has followed a pro-Western foreign\npolicy and has had close relations with the United States for six decades.  However, the\nState Department notes that Jordan\u2019s human rights record continues to reflect some\nproblems.  Problems include: torture, arbitrary arrests, prolonged detention,\novercrowded prison with poor sanitary conditions, denial of due process, infringement\non citizen\u2019s privacy rights, political detainees, and restrictions on freedom of speech,\npress, assembly, association, and movement.  The United Nations reports that torture\nby police and security forces is widespread and allegations of torture have been\nsubstantiated by forensic medical evidence.  Despite Jordan\u2019s aggressive pursuit of\nterrorists, drafting of counter-terrorism legislation, prosecution of terrorism cases\nincluding both Al-Qaida and non Al-Qaida defendants, and investigation and disruption\nof terrorist plots, the threat of terrorism remain high in Jordan.  Terrorists in Jordan often\ndo not distinguish between United States Government personnel and private citizens\nand specifically target areas frequented by Westerners.  Terrorists within Jordan use\novert, covert and clandestine activities to exploit and undermine United States national\nsecurity interests.  Terrorist organizations currently target the United States for\nintelligence collection through human espionage and by other means.  Terrorist groups\nconduct intelligence activities as effectively as state intelligence services.\n\n6\nPOLICIES\nSecurity clearance decisions are not made in a vacuum.  Accordingly, the\nDepartment of Defense, in Enclosure 2 of the 1992  Directive sets forth policy factors\nand conditions that could raise or mitigate a security concern; which must be given\nbinding consideration in making security clearance determinations.  These factors\nshould be followed in every case according to the pertinent criterion.  However, the\nconditions are neither automatically determinative of the decision in any case, nor can\nthey supersede the Administrative Judge\u2019s reliance on her own common sense.\nBecause each security clearance case presents its own unique facts and\ncircumstances, it cannot be assumed that these factors exhaust the realm of human\nexperience, or apply equally in every  case.  Based on the Findings of Fact set forth\nabove, the factors most applicable to the evaluation of this case are:\nForeign Influence\n6.  The Concern.  Foreign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the\nindividual has divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or\ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way that is not\nin U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by any foreign interest.\nAdjudication under this Guideline can and should consider the identity of the foreign\ncountry in which the foreign contact or financial interest is located, including, but not\nlimited to, such considerations as whether the foreign country is known to target United\nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a risk of\nterrorism. \nCondition that could raise a security concern:\n7.  (a) contact with a foreign family member, business or professional associate,\nfriend, or other person who is a citizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact\ncreates a heightened risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or\ncoercion; \n7.  (b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create\na potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive\ninformation or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or\ncountry by providing that information.  \nConditions that could mitigate security concerns:\n8.  (a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which\nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country\nare such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose\nbetween the interests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the\ninterests of the U.S.;\n8.  (b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create\na potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive\n\n7\ninformation or technology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or\ncountry by providing that information;\n8.  (c) Contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent\nthat there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\n8.  (d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government business or are\napproved by the cognizant security authority.\nIn addition, as set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive at pages 16-17, in\nevaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, the Administrative Judge should\nconsider the following general factors:\na.  The nature and seriousness of the conduct and surrounding circumstances\nb.  The circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation\n \nc.  The frequency and recency of the conduct\nd.  The individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct\ne.  The voluntariness of participation\nf.  The presence or absence of rehabilitation and other pertinent behavior\nchanges\ng.  The motivation for the conduct \nh. The potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation or duress\n \ni.  The likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\nThe eligibility criteria established in the DoD Directive identify personal\ncharacteristics and conduct which are reasonably related to the ultimate question,\nposed in Section 2 of Executive Order 10865, of whether it is \u201cclearly consistent with the\nnational interest\u201d to grant an Applicant\u2019s request for access to classified information.\nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\n\n8\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nThe DoD Directive states, \u201cThe adjudicative process is an examination of a\nsufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person is\neligible for a security clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is\npredicted upon the individual meeting these personnel security guidelines.  The\nadjudicative process is the careful weighing of a number of variables known as the\nwhole person concept.  Available, reliable information about the person, past and\npresent, favorable and unfavorable should be considered in reaching a determination. \nThe Administrative Judge can draw only those inferences or conclusions that have\nreasonable and logical basis in the evidence of record.  The Judge cannot draw\ninferences or conclusions based on evidence which is speculative or conjectural in\nnature.  Finally, as emphasized by President Eisenhower in Executive Order 10865,\n\u201cAny determination under this order . . . shall be a determination in terms of the national\ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the Applicant\nconcerned.\u201d\nThe Government must make out a case under Guideline B (foreign influence)\nthat establishes doubt about a person's judgment, reliability and trustworthiness.  While\na rational connection, or nexus, must be shown between Applicant's adverse conduct\nand his ability to effectively safeguard classified information, with respect to sufficiency\nof proof of a rational connection, objective or direct evidence is not required.\nThen, the Applicant must remove that doubt with substantial evidence in\nrefutation, explanation, mitigation or extenuation, which demonstrates that the past\nadverse conduct, is unlikely to be repeated, and that the Applicant presently qualifies for\na security clearance.\nAn individual who demonstrates a foreign influence ad has foreign connections\nmay be prone to provide information or make decisions that are harmful to the interests\nof the United States.  The Government must be able to place a high degree of\nconfidence in a security clearance holder to abide by all security rules and regulations,\nat all times and in all places.\nCONCLUSIONS\n\n9\nHaving considered the evidence of record in light of the appropriate legal\nstandards and factors, and having assessed the Applicant's credibility based on the\nrecord, this Administrative Judge concludes that the Government has established its\ncase as to all allegations in the SOR.   \nUnder Foreign Influence, Disqualifying Condition 7(a) contact with a foreign\nfamily member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a\ncitizen of or resident of a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion and, 7(b)\nconnections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that create a potential\nconflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or\ntechnology and the individual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by\nproviding that information applies.  \n  \nHowever, the Applicant has provided compelling evidence to show that the\nfollowing Mitigating Conditions also apply to this particular case, given his particular\nbackground:  Mitigating Conditions 8(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign\npersons, the country in which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of\nthose persons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a\nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, group,\norganization, or government and the interests of the U.S.; 8(b) connections to a foreign\nperson, group, government, or country that create a potential conflict of interest\nbetween the individual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the\nindividual\u2019s desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that\ninformation; 8(c) Contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and\ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or\nexploitation and, 8(d) the foreign contacts and activities are on U.S. Government\nbusiness or are approved by the cognizant security authority also apply.\nAlthough the Applicant has foreign family members in Iraq, Syria and Jordan who\nare residents and/or citizens of Iraq, the Applicant is not close to them and now has no\ncontact with them whatsoever.  There is no evidence of a close bond or strong evidence\nof affection.  The Applicant\u2019s deep and abiding ties are here in the United States.  All of\nhis immediate family reside in the United States.  All of his financial assets are in the\nUnited States.  He is an American citizen.  For the past thirty years he has worked hard\nto establish himself as a responsible, trustworthy, professional and loyal American\ncitizen.  His wife and children are all citizens and residents of the United States.  His\nunique employment with the DOD, his assets, that include his homes, business and\nbank accounts are all in the United States.  The Applicant has essentially cut all ties\nfrom Iraq when he moved to the United States and made it his permanent home for the\npast thirty years.  \nHis relationship with his family in Iraq, Syria and Jordan, tenuous though it is,\ndoes create a heightened risk of foreign pressure or attempted exploitation because\nterrorists in the Middle East seek intelligence and are hostile to the United States\u2019\ninterests.\nIraq, Syria or Jordan are not safe places for anyone, that much is true.  They are\nwar zones.  However, there is substantial evidence that the Applicant behaved in a\n\n10\ncourageous and honorable way during his tour of duty in Iraq.  Officers, senior non-\ncommissioned officers, and enlisted soldiers from the military have submitted glowing\nwritten statements discussing the Applicant\u2019s activities in Iraq, his strong sense of\nintegrity, and specifically his ability to safeguard classified information in a combat area.\n  Applicant established application of Mitigating Conditions 8(a), 8(b), 8(c), and\n8(d).  Based on his relationships and depth of loyalty to the United States, he can be\nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the United States interest.  He has\nlived in the United States since 1978 until his employment with the Department of\nDefense in 2003.  The Applicant has been a naturalized American citizens for over\ntwenty years.  His wife is a naturalized citizen and his children are native born\nAmericans.  He owns a two houses in the United States and has no financial interests of\nany kind in Iraq.  He has limited contact with his family members living in Iraq and there\nis no evidence that he has connections or contact with anyone over there other than his\nfamily members.\nIt is noted that the current political situation in Iraq, Syria and Jordan elevates the\ncause for concern in this case.  However, the evidence shows that the Applicant has no\nbond and affection with any foreign country or to any foreign individual or to any foreign\nGovernment in any way that could potentially cause the Applicant to become subject to\nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion against the\ninterests of the United States.  Therefore, there is no possibility of foreign influence that\nexists that could create the potential for conduct resulting in the compromise of\nclassified information.  I find that the Applicant is not vulnerable to foreign influence.\nAccordingly, I find for the Applicant under Guideline B (Foreign Influence).\nConsidering all the evidence, the Applicant has met the mitigating conditions of\nGuideline B of the adjudicative guidelines set forth in Enclosure 2 of the Directive.\nAccordingly, he has met his ultimate burden of persuasion under Guideline B.  \nFORMAL FINDINGS\nFormal Findings For or Against the Applicant on the allegations in the SOR, as\nrequired by Paragraph 25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive are:\nParagraph 1: For the Applicant.\nSubparas.\n1.a.: For the Applicant\nSubparas.\n1.b.: For the Applicant\nSubparas.\n1.c.: For the Applicant\nSubparas.\n1.d.: For the Applicant\nSubparas.\n1.e.: For the Applicant\nDECISION\n\n11\nIn light of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly\nconsistent with the national interests to grant or continue a security clearance for the\nApplicant.\nDarlene Lokey Anderson\nAdministrative Judge\n \n",

Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance is denied. \n \nOn January 8, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued \nto Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing security concerns under Guideline \nF, Financial Considerations. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and \neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in writing on January 29, 2008, and elected to have \nhis case decided on the written record. Department Counsel submitted the \ngovernment\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) on March 17, 2008. The FORM was \nmailed to Applicant on March 19, 2008, and it was received on March 25, 2008. \nApplicant was afforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material in refutation, \n \n1 \n \n \nMay 14, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n                                                          \nextenuation, or mitigation. Applicant did not object to the FORM and did not submit \nadditional material. The case was assigned to me on May 9, 2008.  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, exhibits, and statements submitted, I make the following \nfindings of fact. \n \n \nApplicant is 31 years old and has worked for a federal contractor since 2001. He \nserved on active duty in the Navy from 1997 to 2001, and was honorably discharged. \nHe is divorced and remarried and provides child support for his two children from his \nfirst marriage.  \n \n \nApplicant has 11 delinquent accounts, totaling approximately $11,461, that he \nadmitted he owes, and he has not provided any proof of payment or resolution toward \nany of the accounts.1 He listed the debts on his security clearance application (SCA) \nthat he signed on September 26, 2006.2 The accounts were referred for collection or \ncharged off beginning in 2002 until 2006. Applicant has been continually employed \nsince 1997 and with his current employer since 2001.3 In his December 5, 2006 \nstatement to an investigator from the Department of Defense, he stated he had spoken \nto a mortgage/loan officer who advised him not to pay the debts because it would \nreopen the accounts and thereby hurt his credit.4 He reiterated this response to \ninterrogatories on October 26, 2007.5 In his answer to the SOR dated January 29, 2008, \nhe stated:  \n \n \nI realize that I have a lot of old and negative marks on my credit report. I \nhave taken this opportunity to take a hard look at my credit situation and \nhave hired a credit counseling service, to help me target and clean up \nthese old debts. The company is [A] and I have an account with them and \nam working to repair and correct my credit situation. I have enclosed my \naccount details and their contact information.6 \n \n1 Applicant admitted the allegation in SOR 1.l. relieving the Government of having to prove it. The \nallegations stated that on January 5, 2007, an incident report was filed indicating Applicant\u2019s company \ncredit card was in arrears in the amount of $10,000 and he was unable to pay it due to litigation related to \na personal family matter. On January 18, 2007, the report reflected that this account had been paid in full. \nThe debt was paid 13 days after the incident report. I find for Applicant regarding this allegation.  \n \n2On Applicant\u2019s Electronic Questionnaire for Investigations Processing (e-QIP) signed on \nSeptember 26, 2006, he admitted he had eleven delinquent debts. The total he listed was $14,248.  \n \n3 Item 4. \n \n4 Item 5. \n \n5 Item 6. \n \n6 Item 3. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nApplicant provided a three page document that introduces him to Company A\u2019s \nprogram, their governing laws, and a limited power of attorney. Applicant signed the \ndocuments on January 29, 2008. No other information was provided as to what action \nApplicant has taken on his debts. There is no evidence Applicant has paid any of his \ndelinquent debts or has set up any payment plans. \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The \nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security \ndecision.  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:  \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them, especially AG & 19(a) (\u201cinability or unwillingness to satisfy \ndebts\u201d) and (c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). Applicant has eleven \ndelinquent debts that remain unpaid. He listed them on his SCA in September 2006 and \nhas not provided any information that he has attempted to resolve them. I find both \ndisqualifying conditions apply. \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating \nconditions. I especially considered AG \u00b6 20(a) (\u201cthe behavior happened so long ago, \nwas so infrequent, or occurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment\u201d), (b) (\u201cthe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances\u201d), (c) (\u201cthe person has received or is \nreceiving counseling for the problem and/or there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control\u201d), and (d) (\u201cthe individual initiated a good-faith effort \nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d).  \n \nApplicant has more than $11,000 in delinquent debts. He has not paid them and \noffered no explanation as to why, other than he did not want to reopen them. He has \nbeen employed steadily since 1997. Therefore, I find (a) and (b) are not applicable. \nAfter receiving the SOR, Applicant contacted a credit counseling service, but provided \nno proof of any substantive action he has taken to pay or resolve his debts. There is no \nevidence Applicant received counseling to assist him in resolving his financial problems. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThere are no indications the problems are being resolved or that he has initiated a \ngood-faith effort to pay his creditors. Applicant has not acted responsibly toward his just \ndebts. Some of the debts were sent to collection as far back as 2002 and 2003. \nApplicant was aware of the debts and listed them on his SCA in 2006. Despite being \naware of the concern, he has not taken action to pay even the smallest debt. I find none \nof the remaining mitigating conditions apply.  \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant is 31 years old and has \nbeen employed since 1997. He has numerous delinquent debts that date as far back as \n2002. Despite being aware of them he chose for a period of time to do nothing because \nhe did not want to reopen them. Recently, he contacted a credit counseling service, but \ndid not provide proof that he has actually set up a payment plan or resolved any of his \ndebts. Applicant\u2019s irresponsible attitude towards his finances is a cause of concern. I am \nunable to conclude Applicant has successfully mitigated the security concerns raised. \nOverall the record evidence leaves me with serious questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising from financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.k: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.l.  \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interest of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Nagel, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\nFebruary 26, 2009\n______________\nDecision\n______________\nMOGUL, Martin H., Administrative Judge:\nOn February 22, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA)\nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the security concerns under Guidelines\nF, J, and E for Applicant. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865,\nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended;\nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security\nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised\nadjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and\neffective within the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006. \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR (RSOR) in writing on April 7, 2008, and\nrequested a hearing before an Administrative Judge. The case was assigned to this\nAdministrative Judge on December 12, 2008. DOHA issued a notice of hearing on\nDecember 16, 2008, and the hearing was convened as scheduled on January 27, 2008,\nin Sacramento, California. The Government offered Exhibits 1 through 9, which were\nreceived without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf and submitted Exhibits\nA and B, which were admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript of the\nhearing (Tr) on February 4, 2009. \n\n2\nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, eligibility\nfor access to classified information is denied.\nFindings of Fact\nIn his RSOR Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations: 1.a. through 1.j.,\nunder Guideline F, 2.a. through 2.h., under Guideline J, and 3.a. through 3.d., under\nGuideline E.  All of the admitted allegations are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, including\nApplicant's RSOR, the admitted documents, and the testimony of Applicant, and upon\ndue consideration of that evidence, I make the additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 44 years old. He is married, and he has six children.\nApplicant is employed as a mechanic by a defense contractor, and he seeks a\nDoD security clearance in connection with his employment in the defense sector.\nParagraph 1 Guideline F, Financial Considerations\nThe SOR lists 10 allegations of overdue debts, 1.a. through 1.j., under\nAdjudicative Guideline F. Applicant admitted that all of these debts remain overdue and\nunpaid in his RSOR. During his testimony, he gave some different and confusing\nexplanations as to whether some of these debts had been resolved. However, since\nApplicant offered no evidence that he had paid anything on any of the debts, I find he\nfailed to prove that any of them have been satisfied. All of the debts will be reviewed in\nthe same order as they were listed in the SOR:\n1.a. This overdue debt to Creditor 1 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $232. \n1.b. This overdue debt also to Creditor 2 is cited in the SOR in the amount of\n$5,060, for a judgement, as a result of Applicant\u2019s theft of a vehicle. Applicant previously\nclaimed that he had paid this debt, but he has produced no documentation to show that\nthe debt has been resolved, and on a February 7, 2008 credit report it show that this\ndebt remains unpaid. \n1.c. This third overdue debt to Creditor 3 is cited in the SOR in the amount of\n$353.\n1.d. This overdue debt to Creditor 4 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $158. \n1.e. This overdue debt to Creditor 5 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $595. \n1.f. This overdue debt to Creditor 6 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $592\n1.g. This overdue debt to Creditor 7 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $5,540. \n\n3\n1.h. This overdue debt to Creditor 8 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $3,572,\nfor a civil judgement entered against him. \n1.i. This overdue debt to Creditor 9 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $4,339. \n1.j. This overdue debt to Creditor 10 is cited in the SOR in the amount of $168. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline J - Criminal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges that Applicant has engaged in criminal acts.\n2.a. Applicant was arrested on or about August 24,1986, and charged with (1) Hit\nand Run Resulting in Death/Injury, (2) Perjury, and (3) Perjury-Punishment. He was\nfound guilty of Count (1) and was sentenced to serve 30 days in jail. \n2.b. Applicant was arrested on or about October 19, 1990, and charged with\n2  Degree. He was found guilty and was sentenced to serve 36 months in jail,\nBurglary \nnd\nsuspended, sentenced to serve 36 months of probation, and granted work release. \n \n2.c. Applicant was arrested on or about November 23,1993, and charged with (1)\nGrand Theft Property, and (2) Conspiracy.\n2.d. Applicant was arrested on or about September 3, 1997, and charged with\nConvicted Felon in Possession of Firearm, a felony. He was convicted of a\nmisdemeanor charge and sentenced to complete 180 hours of community service and\nawarded three years of probation. Six months after Applicant\u2019s sentence, he was\narrested again and the misdemeanor charge was discarded, and he was convicted of\nthe original felony charge. His probation period was increased to five years. \n2.e. Applicant was arrested on or about October 4,1999, and charged with (1)\nFailure to Provide for his Child, (2) Failure to Appear in Court, and twelve counts of\nContempt of Court. He plead guilty to Count (2) and he was found guilty of all other\ncounts. He was ordered to pay child support in the amount of $400.00 per month to\n \nbegin in February 2000. On August 3, 2005, the case was dismissed. \nApplicant claimed that he served 45 days in jail for this charge, but ultimately he\nclaimed that he was not overdue on his child support.  No evidence was offered to\nsupport Applicant\u2019s claim that he was not guilty of the charge of failure to support his\nchild. \n2.f. Applicant was arrested on or about December 3,1999, and charged with (1)\nReceive Stolen Property, (2) Chop Shop Operation, (3) Possession of a Controlled\nSubstance, and (4) Vin/Serial Numbers Removed. He was found guilty of Count (1),\nsentenced to serve two days in jail, awarded five years of probation, ordered to take\nTheft Classes, and perform community service work. He was also  ordered by the court\nnot to possess firearms and to pay restitution in the amount of $200.00. \n\n4\n2.g. Applicant was arrested on or about March 28, 2001, and charged with (1)\nFailure to Provide After Adjudication.\n2.h. Applicant was arrested on or about May 24, 200I, and charged with (1)\nFailure to Provide for your Child, (2) Failure to Appear in Court, and five counts of\nViolation of Court Order. This case was transferred to a previously opened case against\nApplicant.\n2.i. That information set forth under paragraph 3., below, which constitutes a\nviolation of Federal law, Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001, a felony. \nParagraph 3 Guideline E, Personal Conduct\n3.a. Applicant falsified material facts on a Security Clearance Application (SCA),\nexecuted by him on March 9, 2007, on which he was required to reply to the following\nquestions: \"Section 23: a. Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any felony\noffense? (Include those under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.)\"; and \"Section 23:\nb. Have you ever been charged with or convicted of a firearms or explosives offense?\"\nand \"Section 23: d. Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any offense(s)\nrelated to alcohol or drugs?\"; and \"Section 23: f. In the last 7 years, have you been\narrested for, charged with, or convicted of any offense(s) not listed in response to a, b,\nc, d, or e above? (Leave out traffic fines of less than $150 unless the violation was\nalcohol or drug related.).\" \nApplicant  answered \"Yes\" to question 23.a., and listed his 1999 Receiving\nStolen Property arrest and conviction.  He answered \"No\" to the remaining questions\n(23.b., d. and f.) Applicant deliberately failed to provide that he had been charged with\nother felony offense(s), firearms offense(s), drug-related charge(s), and he had been\narrested for, charged with and/or convicted of other offenses within the last seven years,\nas set forth in subparagraphs 2.a., 2.b., 2.c, 2.d., 2.f., 2.g. and/or 2.h., above. \n3.b. Applicant falsified material on the following question of his SCA: \u201cSection 27:\nd. In the last 7 years, have you had any judgments against you that have not been\npaid?\"; to which he answered \"No.\" Applicant deliberately failed to list that he had an\nunpaid judgments that had been filed against him within the last seven years, as set\nforth in subparagraphs 1.b. and 1.h., above. \n3.c. Applicant responded \"No\"  to: \"Section 28: a. In the last 7 years, have you\nbeen over 180 days delinquent on any debt(s)?\" He deliberately failed to list that he had\nbeen over 180 days delinquent on the debts, as set forth in subparagraphs 1.a., 1.c.,\n1.d., 1.e., 1.f., 1.g., 1.i. and 1. j., above. \n3.d. Applicant responded \"No\"  to: \"Section 28: b. Are you currently over 90 days\ndelinquent on any debt(s)?\" He deliberately failed to list that he was currently 90 days\ndelinquent on the debts, as set forth in subparagraphs 1.a., 1.c., 1.d., 1.e., 1.f., 1.g., 1.i.\nand 1. j., above. \n\n5\nApplicant testified that he was not trying to mislead the Government, he simply\nmisread or failed to understand the questions. \nI find that his explanation does not explain how his responses could be so\nincorrect, incomplete and misleading in five different responses.\nApplicant  offered into evidence his performance review of 2008 (Exhibit A),\nwhich gave him an overall rating of \u201c4\" which means \u201cExceeds Standards.\u201d He also\noffered into evidence a Request For Change of Status Form, which recommended that\nhe receive a pay increase as of March 5, 2007 (Exhibit B).\nPolicies\nWhen evaluating an Applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the\nAdministrative Judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition\nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list\npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in\nevaluating an Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the\ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the\nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The Administrative Judge\u2019s over-arching\nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6\n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as\nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The Administrative Judge must consider all available,\nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in\nmaking a decision.   \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b)\nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to\nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this\ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on\nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences\ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture.\nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish\ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the Applicant is\nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate,\nor mitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The\nApplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security\ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary\nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This\nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The\nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of\n\n6\nthe possible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or\nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally\npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of\nclassified information.\n \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of\nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the\napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites\nfor access to classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis\nGuideline F- Financial Considerations\nThe Government has established that Applicant has had a history of financial\ndifficulties and overdue debts.\nRegarding the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline F, I conclude both\nDC 19. (a) and DC (c) apply, because of Applicant\u2019s inability or unwillingness to satisfy\nhis debts, and his long history of not meeting financial obligations. \nI can not find that any Mitigating Condition (MC) applies as Applicant has failed to\nresolve any of his overdue debts.   I, therefore, hold Guideline F against Applicant.\nGuideline J - Criminal Conduct\nThe Government has established that Applicant engaged in criminal conduct on\nat least eight different occasions that spanned a period from 1986 to the most recent\nviolation of Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001, a felony, when he furnished\nuntruthful information on his 2007 SCA.  \nIn reviewing the Disqualifying Conditions (DC) under Guideline J, DC 31. (a), a\nsingle serious crime or multiple lesser offenses, applies in this case. I find that no MC\napplies to this Applicant, because of the seriousness, extant and duration of Applicant\u2019s\ncriminal conduct. Applicant has not mitigated this allegation. Paragraph 2 is found\nagainst Applicant. \nGuideline E- Personal Conduct\nWith respect to Guideline E, the evidence establishes that Applicant provided\nincorrect, untruthful, incomplete material information on several, separate questions that\nhe provided to the Government on the SCA that he executed on March 9, 2007.\nBecause of the extent of his lack of honesty and candor regarding very clearly written\nquestions, I find that Applicant did intend to mislead the Government.\n\n7\nIn reviewing the DCs under Guideline E,  I conclude that because Applicant\ndeliberately omitted and concealed relevant facts from a SCA, DC 16. (a) applies\nagainst Applicant. I find no MCs can be applied. I therefore, resolve Guideline E against\nApplicant.\nWhole Person Concept\nUnder the whole person concept, the Administrative Judge must evaluate an\nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s\nconduct and all the circumstances. The Administrative Judge should consider the nine\nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness\nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include\nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which participation\nis voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent\nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure,\ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.\u201d\nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole person concept.       \nI have considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions under\nGuidelines F, J,  and E, in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case.\nBased on all of the reasons cited above, including Applicant\u2019s history of financial\ndifficulties, his failure to resolve the overdue debts, his history of criminal conduct, and\nhis failure to give honest complete information to the Government, I find that the record\nevidence leaves me with significant questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and\nsuitability for a security clearance under the whole person concept. For all these\nreasons, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline F:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 1.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.e.: \nAgainst  Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.f.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.g.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.h.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.i.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.j.: \nAgainst Applicant\n\n8\nParagraph 2, Guideline J:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 2.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.e.: \nAgainst  Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.f.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.g.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.h.: \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 2.i.: \nAgainst Applicant\nParagraph 3, Guideline E:\nAGAINST APPLICANT\nSubparagraph 3.a:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.b:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.c:\nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 3.d:\nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security\nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 32-year-old technical writer for a defense contractor who seeks a security clearance. The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant are adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. Records document that Applicant is unmarried and has no children (see ex. 4). He has no military service of record (ex. 4). He attended college between 1994 and 1998 and was awarded a bachelors degree in mass communications in August 1998 (see ex. 4). Applicant accumulated a delinquent utility debt with creditor 1.a and several delinquent student loan debts with creditor 1.b between 2006 and 2008. His credit report indicates he took out his student loans in 1995 and 1997, respectively, and defaulted on them in June 2006 (see ex. 6).

Hess, Esquire, Department Counsel\nFor Applicant: Pro Se\n______________\n Decision\n______________\nWESLEY, Roger C., Administrative Judge:\nHistory of Case\nOn March 6, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA),\npursuant to Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Directive), dated January 2, 1992,\nand Department of Defense (DoD) Regulation 5200.2-R, issued a Statement of\nReasons (SOR) to Applicant, which detailed reasons why DOHA could not make the\npreliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security clearance, and\nrecommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a security\nclearance should be granted, continued, denied or revoked.\nApplicant responded to the SOR on August 27. 2008, and elected to have his\ncase decided on the basis of the written record.  Applicant received the File of Relevant\nMaterial (FORM) on February 2, 2009, and did not respond with any information.  The\ncase was assigned to me on April 8, 2009.   Based upon a review of the case file,\npleadings and exhibits, eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nSummary of Pleadings\nUnder Guideline F, Applicant is alleged to have accumulated several delinquent\ndebts between 2006 and 2008. They comprise a utility debt of $612.00 and several\nstudent loans exceeding  $25,000.00 in the aggregate.\nMay 8, 2009\n\n2\nUnder Guideline E, Applicant is alleged to (a) have sold alcohol to a minor\nworking in a convenience store in November 1998, for which he was fined $350.00, and\n(b) used the drug ecstasy on about three or four occasions during the period of 2003-\n2004. \nFor his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations.  He\nclaimed he was not aware of the utility debt before it was brought to his attention during\nthe course of his security clearance investigation.  He claimed that his short term jobs\ndid not produce enough revenue to enable him to pay off his student loans, as he had\nhoped.  He claimed that his alcohol-related conviction was an isolated incident nearly 10\nyears ago that has not been repeated.  And he claimed that his use of ecstasy was very\nlimited (three to four times during the September 2003 and September 2004 time\nperiod, and has not been repeated.  He claimed he has not pursued illegal drugs since\nSeptember 2004. \nFindings of Fact\nApplicant is a 32-year-old technical writer for a defense contractor who seeks a\nsecurity clearance.  The allegations covered in the SOR and admitted to by Applicant\nare adopted as relevant and material findings.  Additional findings follow.\nRecords document that Applicant is unmarried and has no children (see ex. 4).\nHe has no military service of record (ex. 4).  He attended college between 1994 and\n1998 and was awarded a bachelors degree in mass communications in August 1998\n(see ex. 4).\nApplicant accumulated a delinquent utility debt with creditor 1.a and several\ndelinquent student loan debts with creditor 1.b between 2006 and 2008.  His credit\nreport indicates he took out his student loans in 1995 and 1997, respectively, and\ndefaulted on them in June 2006 (see ex. 6).  He attributes (a) his utility debt (creditor\n1.a) to his mistaken belief that the debt was already discharged and (b) his student loan\ndeficiencies to his lack of good paying jobs (see exs. 3 and 5). \nApplicant indicated in the interrogatory responses he furnished in October 2007\nthat he had not contacted his creditors to resolve his debts.  And he conditioned any\ngood faith repayment efforts to repay his student loans on his obtaining a security\nclearance (see exs. 3 and 5).  \nTo date, Applicant has provided no documentation of any efforts to pay or\notherwise resolve his listed debts.  In the personal financial statement he furnished, he\nlists net income of $1,778.00, total expenses of $1,430.00, and a net remainder of\n$348.00 (ex. 5).  \nIn 1998, Applicant (age 22 at the time) was charged and convicted of selling\nalcohol to a minor while working in a convenience store.  In this instance, he failed to\ncheck the ID of the minor seeking to purchase alcohol (ex. 3).   He was fined $350.00\nby the court.\n\n3\nIn 2003-2004, Applicant used ecstasy on about three to four occasions.  He\nassures he has not pursued any further drug use, and has no intention to do so.  He\nstates that he has since followed all laws and regulations related to drug use (ex. 3).\nApplicant\u2019s evidence is not controverted by any other evidence in the record, and is\naccepted.  \nApplicant provided no endorsements or performance evaluations in his behalf.\nNor did he provide any proofs of community and civic contributions.\nPolicies\nThe revised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to\nClassified Information (effective September 2006) list Guidelines to be considered by\njudges in the decision making process covering DOHA cases.  These Guidelines require\nthe judge to consider all of the \"Conditions that could raise a security concern and may\nbe disqualifying\u201d (Disqualifying Conditions), if any, and all of the \"Mitigating Conditions,\"\nif any, before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, continued\nor denied.  The Guidelines do not require the judge to assess these factors exclusively\nin arriving at a decision.  In addition to the relevant Adjudicative Guidelines, judges must\ntake into account the pertinent considerations for assessing extenuation and mitigation\nset forth in E.2.2 of the Adjudicative Process of Enclosure 2 of the Directive, which are\nintended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial common sense decision.\nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following adjudication\npolicy factors are pertinent herein:\nFinancial Considerations\nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy\ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of\njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which\ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and\nability to protect classified information.  An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate\nfunds.  Compulsive gambling is a concern as it may lead to financial\ncrimes including espionage.  Affluence that cannot be explained by known\nsources of income is also a security concern.  It may indicate proceeds\nfrom financially profitable criminal acts. AG, \u00b6 18.\nPersonal Conduct\nThe \nConcern: \nConduct \ninvolving \nquestionable \njudgment,\nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, \nlack \nof \ncandor, \ndishonesty, \nor\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions\nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect\nclassified information.  Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful\nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other\nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  See AG, \u00b6 15.\n\n4\nBurden of Proof\nBy virtue of the precepts framed by the revised Adjudicative Guidelines, a\ndecision to grant or continue an applicant's security clearance may be made only upon\na threshold finding that to do so is clearly consistent with the national interest.\nBecause the Directive requires administrative judges to make a common sense\nappraisal of the evidence accumulated in the record, the ultimate determination of an\napplicant's eligibility for a security clearance depends, in large part, on the relevance\nand materiality of that evidence.  As with all adversary proceedings, the judge may\ndraw only those inferences which have a reasonable and logical basis from the\nevidence of record.  Conversely, the  judge cannot draw factual inferences that are\ngrounded on speculation or conjecture.\nThe Government's initial burden is twofold: (1) It must prove any controverted\nfacts alleged in the Statement of Reasons and (2) it must demonstrate that the facts\nproven have a material bearing  to the applicant's eligibility to obtain or maintain a\nsecurity clearance.  The required showing of material bearing, however, does not\nrequire the Government to affirmatively demonstrate that the applicant has actually\nmishandled or abused classified information before it can deny or revoke a security\nclearance. Rather, consideration must take account of cognizable risks that an\napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information.\nOnce the Government meets its initial burden of proof of establishing admitted\nor controverted facts, the burden of persuasion shifts to the applicant for the purpose\nof establishing his or her security worthiness through evidence of refutation,\nextenuation or mitigation of the Government's case.\nAnalysis  \nApplicant is an employee of a defense contractor who accumulated a number\nof delinquent debts (mostly student loans) during periods of underemployment. All of\nhis listed debts remain unresolved at this time.  Besides his delinquent debts,\nApplicant was involved a prior alcohol-related offense in 1998, and used illegal drugs\non several occasions in the 2003-2004 time frame.  \nApplicant\u2019s finances\nSecurity concerns are raised under the financial considerations guideline of the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines where the individual applicant is so financially\noverextended as to indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to\nabide by rules and regulations, which can raise questions about the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information, and place the\nperson at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.  Applicant\u2019s\naccumulation of delinquent debts and his past inability and unwillingness to address\nthese debts warrant the application of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the\nGuidelines DC \u00b6 19(a), inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts, and \u00b619(c) \u201ca history\nof not meeting financial obligations.\u201d\n\n5\nApplicant\u2019s debts are attributable in part to his holding low paying jobs following\nhis college graduation in August 1998.  All but one of his listed delinquent debts\ninvolve delinquent student loans.  To date, he has not manifested any efforts to\naddress these debts, and conditions any future payments on the debts to his obtaining\na security clearance. \nWithout any documented payment history or plan to resolve his listed debts,\nApplicant cannot be credited with any manifest progress to date in regaining control of\nhis finances and provides no hard assurances of any commitment to resolve his debts\nin the foreseeable future.  Applicant\u2019s finances still require a good deal of effort on his\npart to fully stabilize them. \nBased on his evidentiary showing, extenuating circumstances are associated\nwith Applicant\u2019s inability to take care of his past debts.  Available to Applicant is MC  \u00b6\n20(b) of the financial considerations guideline, \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the\nbehavior were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a\nbusiness downturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or\nseparation, and the individual acted responsibility.\u201d  Also, some judgment problems\npersist over the delinquencies he has failed to cure with respect to his student loans,\nand the conditions he places on addressing them. \nMitigation credit is not available to Applicant based on the evidence developed\nin this administrative record.  Not only are his listed debt delinquencies ongoing, but\nhe has failed to address them in any tangible way.  \n                                                    \nHolding a security clearance involves the exercise of important fiducial\nresponsibilities, among which is the expectancy of consistent trust and candor.\nFinancial stability in a person cleared to access classified information is required\nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of the clearance.  While the\nprincipal concern of a clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is\nvulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in\nfinancial cases (as here).\nWhole person assessment does not enable Applicant to surmount the judgment\nquestions raised by his accumulation of delinquent debts (especially those associated\nwith his student loans).   Since graduating from college in 1998, he has not shown any\nmanifest effort in addressing any of his covered debts to mitigate his still delinquent\ndebts, and credit him with restored control over his finances.  In balance, whole\nperson assessment does not enable Applicant to establish judgment and trust levels\nsufficient to enable him to overcome appraised security concerns arising out his\naccumulation of delinquent debts.\nTaking into account all of the extenuating facts and circumstances surrounding\nApplicant\u2019s debt accumulations, the limited resources he has had to address them\nwith, the absence of any corrective actions to address his old debts, it is still soon to\nmake safe predictive judgments about Applicant\u2019s ability to repay his debts and\nrestore his finances to stable levels commensurate with his holding a security\nclearance.  Unfavorable conclusions warrant with respect to the allegations covered\nby subparagraphs 1.a and 1.b. \n\n6\nApplicant\u2019s alcohol and drug abuse history\nApplicant\u2019s alcohol and drug involvement is very limited. Still, it is sufficient\n(considered together) to raise some independent security concerns. \nOn the strength of the evidence presented, one of the disqualifying conditions\nof the AGs for personal conduct is applicable: DC \u00b6 16(d)(3), \u201ca pattern of dishonesty\nor rule violations. Afforded an opportunity to respond to the FORM materials, Applicant\ndid not reply. \nJudgment concerns exist over Applicant\u2019s past alcohol-related conviction and\nensuing use of illegal drugs. These actions reflect judgment lapses and disregard of\nlocal laws and regulations governing substance abuse. Applicant\u2019s actions are\nexpressly covered by Guideline E, and are entitled to independent cognizance under\nthis Guideline according to the Appeal Board.  See ISCR Case No. 06-20964, at 6\n(April 10, 2008).  Where (as here) there is additional probative adverse information\ncovered by Guideline E that is not expressly covered by Guidelines G and  H, and\nwhich reflects a recurring pattern of questionable judgment, irresponsibility or\nemotionally unstable behavior, independent grounds do exist for considering\nquestionable judgment and trustworthiness allegations under Guideline E.  Authority\nfor considering overlapping conduct covered by multiple guidelines is contained in the\nguidance provided in Enclosure 2, \u00b6 2(d) of the Directive\u2019s August 2006 amendments. \nSo, under Guideline E, core judgment and trustworthiness concerns covered by\nD.C. \u00b6 16(d), \u201ccredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any\nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but\nwhich, when combined with all available information supports a whole-person\nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor,\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating\nthat the person may not properly safeguard protected information,\u201d is applicable in this\ncase.\nApplicant may take advantage of one of the mitigating conditions under the\npersonal conduct guideline.  MC \u00b6 17(c), \u201cthe offense is so minor, or so much time has\npassed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique\ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s\nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment,\u201d is fully applicable. Here again,\nApplicant\u2019s involvement with alcohol-related offenses and illegal drugs is limited to the\none alcohol-related offense in 1998 and the few scattered incidents of illegal drug use\nin 2003-2004.  None of the covered conduct has been since repeated, and is unlikely\nto be repeated in the future based on the evidence of record. \nFrom a whole person perspective, Applicant has not established enough\nindependent probative evidence in the administrative record to warrant positive\nassessments  under the whole person concept in the Directive.  He has provided no\nendorsements from supervisors and coworkers with his employer to soften or mitigate\nany of the drug and judgment concerns associated with his past drug use.\n\n7\nStill, our Appeal Board has cautioned against drawing adverse inferences and\nconclusions based on past actions and the absence of any corroborating proof of\nsuspension of alcohol-related offenses and drug use.   See ISCR Case No. 01-26893\n(October 2002); ISCR Case No. 97-0356 (April1998). The Appeal Board has\nconsistently held that an unfavorable credibility determination concerning an applicant\nis not a substitute for record evidence that the applicant used marijuana since his last\nrecorded use, or based on his past use is likely to resume usage in the future.  See\nISCR Case No. 02-08032 (May 2004). \nTaking into account all of the facts and circumstances surrounding Applicant\u2019s\njudgment lapses stemming from his one alcohol-related offense in 1998 and limited\ndrug use in the limited time period of 2003-2004, Applicant mitigates security concerns\nrelated to his personal conduct issues.  Favorable conclusions warrant with respect to\nthe allegations covered by Guideline E.\nIn reaching my decision, I have considered the evidence as a whole, including\neach of the E2(a) factors enumerated in the Adjudicative Guidelines of the Directive.\nFormal Findings\nIn reviewing the allegations of the SOR and ensuing conclusions reached in the\ncontext of the findings of fact, conclusions, conditions, and the factors listed above, I\nmake the following formal findings:\nGUIDELINE F (FINANCES):         \nAGAINST APPLICANT\n   \nSub-paras. 1.a and 1.b:\nAgainst t Applicant\nGUIDELINE E: (PERSONAL CONDUCT):         FOR APPLICANT\n   \nSub-paras.2.a and 2.b:\nFor Applicant\nConclusions\nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not\nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s security\nclearance.

Applicant contends four debts are really two debts due to duplication of \ncollectors, leaving 11 delinquent debts.  The status of those debts is listed below: \n \nA credit card debt owed to a bank through a collector.  It is listed in the SOR under \nParagraphs 1. a and 1.b.  The amount owed is listed as $4,269 and $3,184, \nrespectively.  Applicant is settling the debt for $2,207.75 by paying $736 in three \npayments on October 24, October 31, and November 14, 2008. He made the first two \npayments. (Tr. 24-26; Exhibits 2-6, A; Answer)  \n \n1. A telephone bill for $246 was owed (Para. 1.c). The debt was paid in \nfull on April 7, 2008. (Tr. 27; Exhibits 2-6, B)  \n \n2. A medical debt of $253 was paid in full on April 7, 2008 (Para. 1.d).  \n(Tr. 27; Exhibits 2-6, C)  \n \n3. Another medical debt for $130 was paid in full on April 8, 2008 (Para. \n1.e).  (Tr. 28; Exhibits 2-6, D)  \n \n\n \n3 \n \n \n                                                          \n4.

A line of credit loan from a credit union in the amount of $3,470 is \nbeing paid by Applicant (Para. 1.g).  In his 2001 divorce decree, his \nformer wife was declared responsible for that debt, and was to hold \nApplicant harmless from it.  She later filed bankruptcy, and he was the \nco-signer on the loan, so he has been paying the loan.  He is paying \non the installment basis every month since November 2008.  His \npayment is $100 monthly.  He paid $400.05 on October 28, 2008 to \nstart the repayment process.  (Tr. 30, 31; Exhibits 2-6, F, P, Q) \n  \n6. Applicant owed a tanning salon a debt of $119.64 (Para. 1.h).  He \nrepaid this debt on March 3, 2008. (Tr. 32; Exhibits 2-6, G) \n \n7.  A cable bill for $258 was paid in full on March 5, 2008 (Para. 1.i).  (Tr. \n33; Exhibits 2-6, H) \n \n8. A credit card debt of $611 was paid in full on October 22, 2008 (Para. \n1.j). (Tr. 33; Exhibits 2-6, I) \n \n9.  Another telephone bill owed to a service provider in the amount of $88 \nwas paid in full on April 8, 2008 (Para. 1.k).  (Tr. 34; Exhibits 2-6, J) \n \n \n \n11. An auto loan debt in the amount of $10,828 for a van repossession - \nremains unpaid (Para 1.l). Applicant attempted to arrange a repayment \nplan, but the collection company would not negotiate with him.  He \ncomplained to the collection agent\u2019s manager, and Applicant continues \nto attempt to negotiate a repayment plan.  He has contemplated trying \nto borrow $5 or $6 thousand dollars to make a lump sum payment to \nresolve the debt. (Tr. 35-38; Exhibits 2-6, K) \n \n \n \n \n12. A telephone bill for $87 (Para. 1.m) is the same debt owed in Para.  \n \n \n1.k, and that debt has been repaid. (Tr. 40; Exhibits 2-6, L) \n \n \nIn summary, Appellant has paid or resolved seven debts, three accounts are \nbeing paid, and one remains unresolved though not from lack of some effort by \nApplicant to arrange a repayment plan. (Tr. 24-40) \n \n \nAppellant submitted information containing two other past due accounts not listed \non the SOR: a collector for a medical account in the amount of $5,395.88 on which \nApplicant is paying $100 monthly; and an insurance bill debt for $202 which he paid in \nfull on October 31, 2008.1 (Tr. 40, 41; Exhibits M, N) \n \n1I will not consider these debts for disqualifying purposes, but will consider them when analyzing \nthe whole person and his total financial situation.  \n\n \n4 \n \n \n \n \nAppellant submitted a letter from his employer concerning the commencement of \nhis employment. He also submitted four customer evaluations for his services at various \ntrade shows.  His work was rated \u201csuperior.\u201d (Exhibits R to W) \n \n \nDuring his personal appearance, Appellant was honest about his delinquent \nobligations caused by his divorce and successive periods of unemployment. He \npresented his case in an organized and mature manner. He conveyed a comprehension \nof the importance of responsible personal and financial conduct.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition \nto brief introductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s over-arching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe Applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d  \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information.  Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \n\n \n5 \n \n \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \n  \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information).   \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG & 18:       \n \nFailure or inability to live within one=s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual=s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect \nclassified \ninformation. \nAn \nindividual \nwho \nis \nfinancially \noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate \nfunds.  \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. Under \nAG & 19(a), an Ainability or unwillingness to satisfy debts@ is potentially disqualifying.  \nSimilarly under AG & 19(c), Aa history of not meeting financial obligations@ may raise \nsecurity concerns. Beginning in 2001, Applicant began accumulating some delinquent \ndebt that he was unable to pay for a period of time. The evidence is sufficient to raise \nthese potentially disqualifying conditions.  \n \nThe guideline also includes three examples of conditions that could mitigate \nsecurity concerns arising from financial difficulties. Under AG & 20(b), it may be \nmitigating where Athe conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances.@ As noted above, the financial problems \narose from three periods of unemployment between 2001 and 2006, which were \nconditions beyond his control.  His wife is legally responsible for one of the debts, but \nshe has not paid it, so Applicant, as the loan co-signer, is making repayments. He acted \nresponsibly in identifying and resolving these debts. I find this potentially mitigating \ncondition is a factor for consideration in this case.  \n \nSecond, evidence that Athe person has received or is receiving counseling for the \nproblem and/or there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol@ is potentially mitigating under AG & 20(c).  There is clear evidence Applicant is \n\n \n6 \n \n \nresolving his financial problems on his own initiative. Since March 2008, he has repaid \nseven debts in full, is currently repaying three debts on installment repayment plans, \nand has one unresolved debt because the creditor would not negotiate a repayment \nplan. Applicant continues to try to resolve this debt, including trying to borrow a \nsufficient amount of money to make a lump sum settlement with this recalcitrant \ncreditor. \n \nThird, AG & 20(d) applies where the evidence shows Athe individual initiated a \ngood-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.@ Applicant \nresolved all but one of the delinquent debts, either by payment or settlement. He is now \nfinancially sound and prepared for future contingencies. I conclude these potentially \nmitigating conditions apply. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a): \u201c(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness \nof the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence.\u201d Under AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.        \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant suffered a divorce after 23 \nyears of marriage, and then three successive layoffs from employers. These events \nprevented him from repaying these debts.  When employed by his current employer, he \nhad steady employment and could accumulate sufficient funds to repay the delinquent \ndebts. Most significantly, he has taken affirmative action to pay or resolve all but one of \nthe delinquent debts raising security concerns. (See AG & 2(a)(6).) Of course, the issue \nis not simply whether all his debts are paidBit is whether his financial circumstances \nraise concerns about his fitness to hold a security clearance. Applicant repaid 10 debts \nin full or is paying through a repayment plan, has repaid one debt not listed in the SOR, \nand, is using an installment payment plan to repay another unlisted SOR debt.  He took \na mature and responsible approach by disclosing the other two debts at the hearing that \nhe is also repaying.  While one debt remains unpaid, it is insufficient to raise security \nconcerns because Applicant is actively engaged in negotiating a settlement and \nrepayment of that debt. (See AG & 2(a)(1).)   \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from his financial \nconsiderations.  \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraph 1.a 1.m: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nPHILIP S. HOWE \nAdministrative Judge \n",

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nApplicant submitted her security clearance application on May 29, 2007 \n(Government Exhibit (GX) 4). On January 14, 2008, the Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its \npreliminary decision to deny her application, citing security concerns under Guidelines J \nand E. The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \nDirective 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG) \npromulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective within the \nDepartment of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \nJuly 25, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on January 18, 2008, and answered \nit on January 30, 2008; but she did not state whether she requested a hearing. She \nresubmitted her answer on March 12, 2008, but again did not state whether she \nrequested a hearing. On April 11, 2008, she stated she did not desire a hearing before \nan administrative judge. DOHA received her response April 16, 2008. Department \nCounsel submitted the government\u2019s written case on April 30, 2008. On May 7, 2008, a \ncomplete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was sent to Applicant, who was \nafforded an opportunity to file objections and submit material to refute, extenuate, or \nmitigate the government\u2019s evidence. Applicant received the FORM on May 14, 2008. \nShe did not respond. The case was assigned to me on July 7, 2008.  \n \nEvidentiary Ruling \n \n \nThe FORM includes responses to DOHA interrogatories that include a personal \nsubject interview from a report of investigation (GX 5), without the authentication \nrequired by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. Because Applicant did not object to any items in the \nFORM, she waived any objection based on lack of authentication. Accordingly, I have \nconsidered the personal subject interview in my decision. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR dated March 12, 2008, Applicant admitted all the \nallegations in the SOR. Her admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact.   \n \n \nApplicant is a 24-year-old draftsman for a defense contractor. She has worked \nfor her current employer since May 2007. She has never held a security clearance. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s police records reflect the arrests and citations listed in the table \nbelow.

She did not disclose any of the earlier \noffenses.  \n \n \nDuring an interview with a security investigator in July 2007, she stated she did \nnot actively steal any items during the alleged shoplifting but she falsely told the police \nshe had taken some of the items to prevent her friend from being charged with stealing \nproperty worth more than $500, a felony. In her answer to the SOR, she admitted her \ndenial of active participation in the shoplifting was false. She also told the investigator \nshe did not disclose the shoplifting incident on her security clearance application \nbecause she thought it would be deleted from her police record after five years and no \none would discover it.  \n \n \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted the shoplifting, admitted falsifying \nher security clearance application by omitting all her arrests and citations except for the \nNovember 2005 incident, and admitted lying to the security investigator.  \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \n\n \n4 \n \n \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant. It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue [her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges shoplifting in April 2002 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and three instances of \ndriving with a suspended license (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d). It also alleges Applicant \nfalsified her security clearance application and lied to a security investigator (SOR \u00b6 \n1.e). The concern raised by criminal conduct is that it \u201ccreates doubt about a person's \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a \nperson's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations.\u201d AG \u00b6 30. \nConditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying include \u201ca single \nserious crime or multiple lesser offenses\u201d and \u201callegation or admission of criminal \nconduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted, \nor convicted.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (c). \n \n \nIt is a felony, punishable by a fine or imprisonment for not more than five years, \nor both, to knowingly and willfully make any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent \nstatement or representation in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive branch \nof the government of the United States. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. Security clearances are \nmatters within the jurisdiction of the executive branch of the government of the United \nStates. A deliberately false answer on a security clearance application is a serious \ncrime within the meaning of Guideline J. Applicant\u2019s false answers on her security \nclearance application and her long record of minor offenses raise AG \u00b6 31(a) and (c). \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) and (e), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence \nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has \nthe burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts \nto the government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cso \nmuch time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under \nsuch unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(a). Applicant\u2019s latest \ncriminal conduct was recent, when she falsified her security clearance application. None \nof the offenses happened under unusual circumstances, and they cast serious doubt on \nher reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I conclude AG \u00b6 32(a) is not \nestablished. \n \nSecurity concerns also may be mitigated if \u201cthere is evidence of successful \nrehabilitation; including but not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of \ncriminal activity, remorse or restitution, job training or higher education, good \nemployment record, or constructive community involvement.\u201d AG \u00b6 32(d). Applicant\u2019s \nfalsification was recent, and she presented no evidence of rehabilitation. \n \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \n \n \nThe SOR alleges three motor vehicle offenses not alleged under Guideline J: \ndriving with no proof of insurance (SOR \u00b6 2.a), and driving an unregistered vehicle, and \nimproperly using the registration for another vehicle (SOR \u00b6 2.b and 2.c). It also alleges \nfalsification of the security clearance application (SOR \u00b6 2.d) and lying to the security \ninvestigator (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.e and 2.f). \n \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15 as follows:  \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process.   \n \nA disqualifying condition under this guideline may be raised by \u201cdeliberate \nomission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security \nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct \ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \ndetermine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(a). Applicant\u2019s falsification of her security clearance \napplication and false statements to the security investigator raise this disqualifying \ncondition. \n\n \n6 \n \n \nA disqualifying condition may arise from \u201ccredible adverse information in several \nadjudicative issue areas that is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any \nother single guideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating \nthat the person may not properly safeguard protected information.\u201d AG \u00b6 16(c). Finally, \na disqualifying condition under this guideline may arise from \u201ccredible adverse \ninformation that is not explicitly covered under any other guideline and may not be \nsufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, when combined with all \navailable information supports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not properly \nsafeguard protected information,\u201d such as \u201ca pattern of dishonesty or rule violations\u201d AG \n\u00b6 16(d)(3). Applicant\u2019s police record raises AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) and (d)(3). \n \nSecurity concerns raised by false or misleading answers on a security clearance \napplication may be mitigated by showing that \u201cthe individual made prompt, good-faith \nefforts to correct the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with \nthe facts.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(a). Applicant made no effort to correct the omissions from her \nsecurity clearance application until she was confronted with the evidence by a security \ninvestigator. Even then, she worsened the situation by lying to the investigator. AG \u00b6 \n17(a) is not established. \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated if \u201cthe offense is so \nminor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is so infrequent, or it happened \nunder such unique circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on \nthe individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment.\u201d AG \u00b6 17(c). None of the \nelements of this mitigating condition are established. Applicant\u2019s falsifications are \nserious offenses and recent, her minor offenses are numerous, her conduct is not \nattributable to \u201cunique circumstances,\u201d and her pattern of conduct casts doubt on her \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \n\n \n7 \n \n \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is a young person who has not yet learned the importance of \nresponsible behavior. Her lack of candor during the security clearance process casts \nserious doubt on her ability to protect classified or sensitive information. After weighing \nthe disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline J and E, and evaluating all \nthe evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated \nthe security concerns based on criminal conduct and personal conduct. Accordingly, I \nconclude she has not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.f: \n \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nLeRoy F.

Borgstrom, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n \n \n______________ \n \nDecision \n______________ \n \n \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \n \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application on January 4, 2007. On \nDecember 14, 2007, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a \nStatement of Reasons (SOR) detailing the basis for its preliminary decision to deny his \napplication, citing security concerns under Guidelines C (Foreign Preference) and B \n(Foreign Influence). The action was taken under Executive Order 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the revised adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated by the President on December 29, 2005, and effective \nwithin the Department of Defense for SORs issued after September 1, 2006.  \n  \n \nApplicant acknowledged receipt of the SOR on December 22, 2007; answered it \non January 10, 2008; and requested a hearing before an administrative judge. DOHA \nreceived the request on January 14, 2008. Department Counsel was prepared to \nproceed on January 30, 2008, and the case was assigned to me on February 4, 2008. \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing on March 13, 2008, scheduling the hearing for April 3, \n2008. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5 \nMay 30, 2008\n\n \n2 \n \n \nwere admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified on his own behalf, and \nhe submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through L, which were admitted without \nobjection. I granted Applicant\u2019s request to keep the record open until April 25, 2008, to \nenable him to submit additional evidence. On April 20, 2008, Applicant requested that \nthe record be kept open until May 2, 2008, and I granted his request. His request and \nmy ruling are attached to the record as Hearing Exhibit (HX) II. Applicant timely \nsubmitted AX M, and it was admitted without objection. Department Counsel\u2019s response \nto AX M is attached to the record as HX III. DOHA received the transcript of the hearing \n(Tr.) on April 17, 2008. The record closed on May 2, 2008. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \n \nEvidentiary Ruling \n \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of relevant facts \nabout Iran. The request and 10 of its 11 enclosures were not admitted in evidence but \nare attached to the record as HX I. I declined to take administrative notice based on one \nof the enclosures, a Congressional Research Service report, because there was no \nindication that the analysis and conclusions of the author were accepted by any agency \nof the U.S. as not subject to reasonable dispute. Department Counsel offered the report \nas GX 5, and it was admitted without objection. The facts administratively noticed are \nset out below in my findings of fact. \n \nCorrection of Transcript \n \n \nApplicant submitted a list of corrections to the transcript, attached to the record \nas HX IV. I accepted his proposed changes and adopted them in my decision, but I did \nnot annotate the original transcript. \n \nFindings of Fact \n \n \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the factual allegations in the \nSOR and offered explanations. His admissions in his answer to the SOR and at the \nhearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. I make the following findings: \n \n \nApplicant is a 52-year-old professor of electrical and systems engineering at a \nprestigious U.S. university. He also works part-time as an independent consultant for a \ndefense contractor. He has never held a security clearance.  \n \n \nApplicant was born in Iran and obtained a bachelor of science degree from the \nUniversity of Tehran in June 1978. He came to the U.S. on a student visa, obtained a \nmaster\u2019s degree in 1979 and a doctorate in 1982. He has been a full-time professor \nsince 1987. He became a U.S. citizen in 1989.  \n \nApplicant is one of the preeminent scientists in the U.S. He submitted evidence \nof 53 honors and distinctions he has received (AX A-H), including an award from the \nU.S. President for his contributions to the scientific and engineering efforts of the U.S. \n\n \n3 \n \n \n(AX B) and selection as one of 50 top scientists worldwide (AX C). He is widely and \nfrequently published in scientific and technical journals (AX I, J). He travels overseas \nfrequently to attend and speak at international conferences, universities, and institutes. \n \nApplicant is very circumspect about revealing sensitive information. When he \nspeaks at or attends international conferences, he provides a narrative biography of his \neducation, honors, and publications, but he protects information about sources of \nresearch funding and sensitive consulting positions (Tr. 125-28). \n \n \nApplicant met his wife while they were both in graduate school in the U.S. They \nwere married in October 1983. His wife was born in Iran, came to the U.S. as a student \nin 1977, and became a U.S. citizen in 1990. They have two children who are native-\nborn U.S. citizens.  \n \n \nApplicant has owned a home in the U.S. since 1990 (Tr. 129). He and his wife \nare active in the community. Their younger child is autistic, and Applicant has been very \ninvolved in activities for autistic children (Tr. 130-31). He prides himself on having \nparticipated in every presidential election, including the primaries, since becoming a \ncitizen (Tr. 132). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s parents are deceased. He has not traveled to Iran since he came to \nthe U.S. in 1979, and he did not attend his parents\u2019 funerals in Iran. He has four living \nsiblings. His older brother came to the U.S. as a political refugee after being detained \nand interrogated by Iranian authorities, and he is now a citizen and resident of the U.S. \n(Tr. 86-87). His younger brother is a citizen and resident of Germany. His older sister is \na citizen and resident of the U.S., and his younger sister is a citizen and resident of \nCanada. \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law, father-in-law, sister-in-law, and half-brother-in-law are \ncitizens and residents of Iran. His mother-in-law and father-in-law were divorced many \nyears ago, when his wife was about 12 years old (Tr. 68). They are both retired school \nteachers (Tr. 69, 71). Applicant\u2019s wife is estranged from her father because he \nabandoned the family after the divorce (Tr. 71). She has visited her family in Iran twice, \nin 1988 for about two weeks and in 2005 for about six weeks (Tr. 66). \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law visited them while they were still in graduate school.  \nShe visited again for more than six months around 1995 and became a permanent U.S. \nresident. She visited again in 1997 but has not returned to the U.S. again, because she \nis too old and frail to travel (Tr. 73).  \n \nApplicant has never met his wife\u2019s father or her sister. His wife has no contact \nwith her father, except for one brief courtesy visit in 2005 (Tr. 68). His wife talks to her \nmother on the telephone about once a month, sometimes less frequently (Tr. 74). She \ntalks to her sister once every three or four months (Tr. 75). Her sister is a university \nprofessor, teaching philosophy or a related field (Tr. 76). Applicant knows little about his \nwife\u2019s sister because he has never met her in person, has no direct contact with her, \n\n \n4 \n \n \nand speaks with her briefly only when she calls Applicant\u2019s wife (Tr. 75). Applicant and \nhis wife have never met her half-brother, born of another marriage after her parents \ndivorced. They do not know where her half-brother is living.  \n \n \nApplicant and his wife both had Iranian passports before they became U.S. \ncitizens, and they allowed them to expire (Tr. 82). In December 2004, they obtained \nnew Iranian passports so his wife could visit her mother, who is old and in poor health, \nher sister, and her nieces and nephews (Tr. 103). His wife used her Iranian passport \nwhen she visited her family in 2005 (Tr. 84). Applicant also obtained an Iranian passport \nso that he could accompany his wife if there was a death in the family and she wanted \nhim to accompany her, but he never used it (Tr. 83-84). On April 29, 2008, he destroyed \nit because of the security issues it raised (AX M). \n \n \nApplicant recently received an email from a former classmate at the University of \nTehran. The date of the email is not reflected in the record. The classmate is an \nelectrical engineer employed by a public utility company in Iran (tr. 94). The classmate \nobtained the email addresses of several classmates and sent out a general request for \nemail addresses from other classmates (AX K). The emails consist of holiday greetings, \njokes, and information about locations of other classmates (Tr. 92). Applicant received \ncongratulations from several classmates when he was named one of the top 50 \nscientists in the world (Tr. 95). Applicant does not regard the classmate as a close \nfriend, and considers the emails to be very casual. His participation in the email \nexchange is passive, and he does not provide any information about his work (Tr. 93). \n \nAt Department Counsel=s request, and without objection from Applicant, I took \nadministrative notice of the following adjudicative facts. Iran is a theocratic Islamic \nrepublic dominated by Shia Muslim clergy, with ultimate political authority vested in a \nlearned religious scholar. Iran\u2019s government is hostile to the U.S. Current U.S. concerns \nabout Iran are based on its efforts to acquire nuclear weapons and weapons of mass \ndestruction; support for and involvement in international terrorism; support for violent \nopposition to the Middle East peace process; and its human rights abuses, including \nsummary executions, torture, arbitrary arrest and detention, and restrictions on civil \nliberties.  Iran has provided guidance, training, and weapons to Shia political and \nmilitant groups in Iraq.  It also provides encouragement, training, funding, and weapons \nto anti-Israeli terrorist groups in its efforts to undermine the Arab-Israeli peace process, \nand it advocates the destruction of Israel. The U.S. has designated Iran as a state \nsponsor of terrorism. The U.S. broke diplomatic relations with Iran in April 1980, \nprohibits most trade with Iran, and uses multilateral sanctions and diplomatic pressure \nto contain the threats posed by Iran. Because Iran does not recognize dual citizenship, \nIranian-born, naturalized U.S. citizens are considered solely Iranian citizens by the \nIranian authorities, and they are required to enter and exit Iran on an Iranian passport. \nWhile traveling or residing in Iran, they are subject to surveillance, search, harassment, \narrest, and imprisonment. \n \n\n \n5 \n \n \nPolicies \n \n \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).  As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \ncontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d  Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended and modified.   \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the revised adjudicative guidelines (AG). These guidelines are not \ninflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these \nguidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s over-arching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial and common \nsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n \n \nThe government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the Applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d  See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is not necessarily a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant.  It is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance \n \n \nInitially, the government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994).  The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).   \n \n \nOnce the government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \n\n \n6 \n \n \nfacts.  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.  An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that \nit is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 \nU.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \n \nAnalysis \n \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant exercises dual citizenship with Iran and the U.S. (\u00b6 \n1.a); he possessed an Iranian passport issued in December 2004 when he answered \nDOHA interrogatories in October 2007 (\u00b6 1.b); and he was issued an Iranian passport in \nDecember 2004 after he became a U.S. citizen (\u00b6 1.c). The concern under Guideline C \nis as follows: \u201cWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may be prone to provide \ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United States.\u201d AG \n\u00b6 9.  \n \n \nDual citizenship standing alone is not sufficient to warrant an adverse security \nclearance decision.  ISCR Case No. 99-0454 at 5, 2000 WL 1805219 (App. Bd. Oct. 17, \n2000).  Under Guideline C, \u201cthe issue is not whether an applicant is a dual national, but \nrather whether an applicant shows a preference for a foreign country through actions.\u201d  \nISCR Case No. 98-0252 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep 15, 1999).  \n \nA disqualifying condition may arise from \u201cexercise of any right, privilege or \nobligation of foreign citizenship after becoming a U.S. citizen,\u201d including but not limited \nto \u201cpossession of a current foreign passport.\u201d AG \u00b6 10(a)(1). A disqualifying condition \nalso may arise from \u201cany statement or action that shows allegiance to a country other \nthan the United States.\u201d AG \u00b6 10(d). Applicant\u2019s possession of an Iranian passport after \nbecoming a U.S. citizen raises AG \u00b6 10(a)(1). His application for an Iranian passport \nafter becoming a U.S. citizen raises AG \u00b6 10(d). \n \n \nSince the government produced substantial evidence to raise the disqualifying \nconditions in AG \u00b610(a)(1) and (d), the burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence \nto rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. Applicant has the \nburden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to \nthe government.  See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).   \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline may be mitigated by evidence that \u201cdual \ncitizenship is based solely on parents\u2019 citizenship or birth in a foreign country.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n11(a). This mitigating condition is only partially established because Applicant derived \nhis Iranian citizenship from his parents and place of birth, but he remained in Iran until \nhe was a young adult, about 24 years old. \n \n\n \n7 \n \n \n \nSecurity concerns based on possession or use of a foreign passport may be \nmitigated if \u201cthe passport has been destroyed, surrendered to the cognizant security \nauthority, or otherwise invalidated.\u201d AG \u00b6 11(e). Applicant\u2019s destruction of his Iranian \npassport establishes this mitigating condition. \n \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \n \n \nThe SOR alleges Applicant\u2019s mother-in-law, father-in-law, sister-in-law, and a \nhalf-brother-in-law are citizens and residents of Iran (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a and 2.b). It also \nalleges he maintains contact with a college friend in Iran (SOR \u00b6 2.c). \n \nThe security concern relating to Guideline B is set out in AG & 6 as follows: \n \nForeign contacts and interests may be a security concern if the individual \nhas divided loyalties or foreign financial interests, may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway that is not in U.S. interests, or is vulnerable to pressure or coercion by \nany foreign interest. Adjudication under this Guideline can and should \nconsider the identity of the foreign country in which the foreign contact or \nfinancial interest is located, including, but not limited to, such \nconsiderations as whether the foreign country is known to target United \nStates citizens to obtain protected information and/or is associated with a \nrisk of terrorism.   \n \n \nA disqualifying condition under this guideline may be raised by \u201ccontact with a \nforeign family member, business or professional associate, friend, or other person who \nis a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion.\u201d AG \u00b6 7(a). A \ndisqualifying condition also may be raised by \u201cconnections to a foreign person, group, \ngovernment, or country that create a potential conflict of interest between the \nindividual\u2019s obligation to protect sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that information.\u201d AG \u00b6 \n7(b). Under the old guidelines, any risk of foreign influence was sufficient to raise a \npotentially disqualifying condition. The new guidelines require a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d \nApplicant had significant contact with his wife\u2019s mother until 1997 and infrequent, \nincidental contact since then. He has no direct contact with his wife\u2019s sister, father, or \nhalf-brother. He lives with his wife, who has frequent contact with her elderly mother and \noccasional contact with her sister. He has email contact with a former classmate in Iran \nwho works for the Iranian government. In light of the nature of Iran\u2019s government, these \ncontacts are sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (b).  \n \nFinally, a security concern may be raised if an applicant is \u201csharing living quarters \nwith a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship creates a \nheightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion\u201d AG \u00b6 7(d). \nA[T]here is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or obligation \nto, the immediate family members of the person's spouse.@ ISCR Case No. 01-03120, \n\n \n8 \n \n \n2002 DOHA LEXIS 94 at * 8 (App. Bd. Feb. 20, 2002). Applicant has rebutted this \npresumption for his wife\u2019s father and sister, but he has not rebutted it for his wife\u2019s \nmother. Given the nature of Iran\u2019s government, there is a heightened risk of pressure on \nApplicant\u2019s wife\u2019s mother, designed to induce his wife to manipulate or influence him. I \nconclude AG \u00b6 7(d) is raised. Since the government produced substantial evidence to \nraise the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), (b), and (d), the burden shifted to \nApplicant to produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.  \n \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States.  \u201cThe United \nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information \nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, \nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to \nthose of the United States.\u201d  ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004).  \n \n \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United \nStates over matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. \nFinally, we know friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, \nespecially in the economic, scientific, and technical fields.  See ISCR Case No. 00-\n0317, 2002 DOHA LEXIS 83 at **15-16 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002).  Nevertheless, the \nnature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the U.S., and its human rights \nrecord are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members are \nvulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is \nsignificantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian government, a family \nmember is associated with or dependent upon the government, or the country is known \nto conduct intelligence operations against the U.S. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under the new guidelines can be mitigated by showing that \n\u201cthe nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which these persons \nare located, or the positions or activities of those persons in that country are such that it \nis unlikely the individual will be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a foreign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of \nthe U.S.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(a). The totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well \nas each individual family tie must be considered.  ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. \nBd. Sep. 22, 2003). Applicant has virtually no contact with his wife\u2019s sister and no \ncontact with her father or half-brother. His contact with a former classmate is casual, \ninfrequent, and superficial. I conclude this mitigating condition is established for his \nsister-in-law, father-in-law, half-brother-in-law, and for his former classmate; but it is not \nestablished for his mother-in-law. Considering the totality of his relationships with \npersons who are citizens and residents of Iran, I cannot fully apply AG \u00b6 8(a). \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also can be mitigated by showing \u201cthere is \nno conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of loyalty or obligation to the \nforeign person, group, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such \ndeep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be \nexpected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(b). The \nAppeal Board has consistently held that an applicant with family members living in Iran \n\n \n9 \n \n \nhas \u201ca very heavy burden of persuasion\u201d to overcome the security concerns raised by \nthat fact. ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006). That burden of \npersuasion became a virtually impossible burden of persuasion under the old \nguidelines. Between January 9, 2007 and January 18, 2008, the Appeal Board decided \n36 appeals involving Iran under the old guidelines, and it reversed 20 decisions granting \nclearances and affirmed 15 decisions denying clearances.1 It reversed every decision \ngranting a clearance and affirmed every decision but one denying a clearance. One \ndecision denying a clearance was remanded because of a procedural error.2  \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(b) has no counterpart in the old guidelines. It is a fundamental change \nfrom the old guidelines, in which the potential for exploitation, manipulation, coercion, or \nduress could only be mitigated by showing the potential did not exist. In cases involving \nthe old guidelines, the Appeal Board held repeatedly that an applicant should not be put \nin a position requiring a choice between the interests of his family and the interests of \nthe U.S. and a foreign country. See ISCR Case No. 03-17620 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 17, \n2006); ISCR Case No. 03-24933 at 6 (App. Bd. Jul. 28, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-\n02382 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-15205 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 21, \n2005). Under the new guidelines, the administrative judge may weigh the conflict of \ninterests and may conclude, based on the evidence, that the applicant \u2018can be \nexpected\u201d to resolve the conflict in favor of the U.S. interest. In reviewing an \nadministrative judge\u2019s balancing, the Appeal Board \u201cshall give deference to the \ncredibility determinations of the Administrative Judge.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.32.1. Because the \n                                                          \n1 In 2005, the Appeal Board reversed all four appealed decisions granting clearances for Iranian-\nAmericans. See ISCR Case No. 03-24933 (App. Bd. July 28, 2005); ISCR Case No. 02-13595 (App. Bd. \nMay 10, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-02382 (App. Bd. Feb. 15, 2005); ISCR Case No. 03-15205 (App. Bd. \nJan. 21, 2005). It affirmed all nine appealed decisions that denied clearances.  See ISCR Case No. 03-\n24144 (App. Bd.

Feb. 28, 2005). In 2006, the Appeal Board reversed all five appealed decisions granting \nclearances for Iranian-Americans. See ISCR Case No. 04-08870 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2006);  ISCR Case \nNo. 04-12500 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006); ISCR Case No. 04-09541 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2006); ISCR Case \nNo. 04-11463 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006); ISCR Case No. 02-24566 (App. Bd.

May 10, 2006); ISCR Case No. 03-10954 (App. Bd. Mar. 8, \n2006). In 2007, the Appeal Board reversed ten decisions granting clearances. See ISCR Case No. 05-\n12088 (App. Bd.

In 2008, the \nAppeal Board reversed one decision granting a clearance See ISCR Case No. 05-02210 (App. Bd. Jan. \n18, 2008).  \n \n2 ISCR Case No. 04-12732 (App. Bd. Nov. 2, 2006) (violation of procedural rules required \nremand). \n \n\n \n10 \n \n \nadministrative judge\u2019s conclusion that an applicant is or is not \u201cexpected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest\u201d is not reviewed de novo, the Appeal \nBoard may not substitute its judgment for the administrative judge\u2019s. Instead, the \nadministrative judge\u2019s conclusion may be overturned only if it is \u201carbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.32.3. There is no direct appeal from an Appeal Board \ndecision. If the Appeal Board does not correctly apply the deferential standard of review \nmandated by the Directive, an applicant\u2019s only recourse is a collateral attack in federal \ndistrict court for failure to follow the Directive. See Nickelson v. United States, 284 \nF.Supp. 2d 387, 393 (E.D. Va. 2003)( requiring agency to follow its own rules in security \nclearance determinations). \n \nAs of April 24, 2008, the Appeal Board had considered seven cases under the \nnew guidelines, affirming four decisions denying clearances3 and reversing three \ndecisions granting clearances.4 The Appeal Board has considered only two cases \ninvolving the mitigating condition in AG \u00b6 8(b) involving Iran. In both cases, it recognized \nthat AG \u00b6 8(b) requires a balancing, but it disagreed with the administrative judges\u2019 \nbalancing and reversed the decisions granting clearances, thereby continuing its track \nrecord over the last three years of having never affirmed a decision granting a clearance \nto an applicant with family members in Iran.5  \n \n \nIn applying the AG \u00b6 8(b) balancing analysis to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case, I \nhave considered that he has lived in the U.S. since 1979, and he never returned to Iran, \neven for his parents\u2019 funerals. He has no living siblings in Iran. Two of his living siblings \nare citizens and residents of the U.S., one is a citizen and resident of Germany, and one \nis a citizen and resident of Canada.  \n \nI have considered that Applicant\u2019s older brother left Iran as a political refugee. \nThe fact that his family has been targeted in the past by Iranian authorities is a two-\nedged sword. On the one hand, it means that his family is known to Iranian authorities; \non the other hand, it means that his family has been subjected to Iranian mistreatment, \ndid not succumb to it, and knows how to deal with it. Moreover, it weighs against any \nvoluntary cooperation with Iranian authorities. \n \nI have considered that Applicant has never met his wife\u2019s father, sister, or half-\nbrother. His only familial contact in Iran is with his wife\u2019s mother. His only other contact \nin Iran is through his largely passive receipt of superficial and casual email messages \nfrom a former college classmate. Whether the classmate is an Iranian agent searching \nfor intelligence information or recruiting intelligence sources cannot be determined. \n                                                          \n3 ISCR Case No. 07-06952 (App. Bd. Arp. 24, 2008); ISCR Case No. 06-23479 (App. Bd. Nov. \n28, 2007); ADP Case No. 06-24818 (App. Bd. Oct. 24, 2007); ISCR Case No. 06-04371 (App. Bd. Oct. \n18, 2007). \n \n4 ISCR Case No. 06-18918 (App. Bd. Mar. 28, 2008); ISCR Case No. 06-25202 (App. Bd. Feb. \n22, 2008); ISCR Case No. 06-25183 (App. Bd. Feb. 21, 2008. \n \n5 ISCR Case No. 06-18918 (App. Bd. Mar. 28, 2008); ISCR Case No. 06-25202 (App. Bd. Feb. \n22, 2008).  \n\n \n11 \n \n \nWhat can be determined is that Applicant has not been offered any bait and would not \ntake it if offered.  \n \nI have considered that Applicant\u2019s wife has lived in the U.S. since 1977 and has \nreturned to visit her family in Iran only twice, that her mother and sister are citizens and \nresidents of Iran, and that her other siblings are citizens and residents of the U.S. and \nCanada. Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s strong connections to the U.S. make it less likely that she \ncould be manipulated directly or through her family members in Iran to influence \nApplicant.  \n \nFinally, I have considered that Applicant\u2019s destruction of his Iranian passport \nmakes it impossible for him to visit Iran and demonstrates his willingness to resolve a \npotential conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. Based on his deep and longstanding \nrelationships and loyalties in the U.S., I conclude AG \u00b6 8(b) is established. \n \n \nSecurity concerns under this guideline also may be mitigated by showing that \n\u201ccontact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and infrequent that there is \nlittle likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign influence or exploitation.\u201d AG \u00b6 8(c). \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that contacts with an immediate family member in a \nforeign country are not casual.  ISCR Case No. 00-0484 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, 2002). \nThis presumption does not apply to Applicant\u2019s contacts with his wife\u2019s mother, but his \nlong relationship with her shows that his contacts, though infrequent, are not casual. On \nthe other hand, his contact with his former Iranian classmate is casual. It is not \n\u201cinfrequent\u201d with respect to the messages initiated by his classmate, but the evidence \nindicates that Applicant has not responded to the emails, making his participation in the \nexchange \u201cinfrequent.\u201d I conclude AG \u00b6 8(c) is established for Applicant\u2019s contacts with \nhis former Iranian classmate. However, after considering the totality of his relationships, \nI conclude this mitigating condition cannot be fully applied. \n \nWhole Person Concept \n \n \nUnder the whole person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a):  \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n\n \n12 \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole person concept.  Some of the factors in \nAG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed above, but some warrant additional comment. \n \n \nApplicant is an exceptionally dedicated and talented engineer who decided many \nyears ago to make his life in the U.S. He never returned to Iran, even for his parents\u2019 \nfunerals. He obtained an Iranian passport primarily because of his devotion to his wife, \nnot because of any feelings of affection or obligation to her family. He was candid, \nsincere, and very credible at the hearing.  \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s wife followed a similar path, returning to Iran only twice in more than \n30 years. Applicant has no immediate family in Iran, and his wife has only her mother, a \nsister, a father with whom she has no relationship, and a half-brother she has never \nmet.  \n \n \nIn some respects, Applicant\u2019s brilliant career and international reputation make \nhim a high visibility target, but he has carefully controlled information about his research \nfunding and consulting contracts. He is certainly no more vulnerable to terrorism or \nintelligence gathering efforts than other prominent government and military officials. He \nnever used his most recent Iranian passport, and he readily destroyed it when he \nlearned it raised security concerns. \n \n \nApplicant has lived in the U.S. for almost 30 years without ever returning to Iran. \nHis wife and two children are U.S. citizens. He is deeply devoted to his wife and \nchildren, his work, and the United States. The only conduit for potential foreign influence \nis through his wife, who also has very strong ties to the U.S. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline C and B, and evaluating all the \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns based on foreign preference and foreign influence. Accordingly, I \nconclude he has carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nFormal Findings \n \n \nI make the following formal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set \nforth in the SOR, as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3: \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline C:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline B:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \nConclusion \n \n \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Under Guideline J, the SOR alleges the following criminal conduct: (1) an arrest for third-degree burglary, theft, and receiving stolen property, all felonies, in October 1981, which resulted in a sentence to incarceration; (2) an arrest for third-degree burglary, a felony, in April 1982; (3) an arrest for assault \u2013 domestic violence/ third- degree harassment stemming from an incident with his wife in May 2004; and (4) a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 by making a false statement to a federal agency as set forth under Guideline E. The SOR alleges under Guideline E that Applicant gave false answers in response to two questions about his police record when he completed a security-clearance application in April 2007. In his Answer, Applicant admitted the three arrests and denied the falsifications. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the following facts are established by substantial evidence. Applicant is a 44-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has worked for his current employer since April 2006. His recent employment record reflects average to above average performance (Exhibits A, B, and C). He is seeking to retain an industrial security clearance that he has held for several years, since about 1996.

Sykstus, Esquire \n                                \n______________\nDecision\n______________\nLEONARD, Michael H., Administrative Judge:\nApplicant contests the Defense Department\u2019s intent to deny or revoke his\neligibility for an industrial security clearance. Acting under the relevant Executive Order\nand DoD Directive,  the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued a\n1\nstatement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant on January 8, 2008. The SOR is equivalent to\nan administrative complaint and it details the factual basis for the action. The issues in\nthis case fall under Guideline J for criminal conduct and Guideline E for personal\nconduct (falsification of a security-clearance application). For the reasons discussed\nbelow, this case is decided against Applicant.\nIn addition to the Executive Order and Directive, this case is brought under the\nrevised Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified\nInformation (Revised Guidelines) approved by the President on December 29, 2005.\nJuly 11, 2008\n\n  See Memorandum from the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, dated August 30, 2006, Subject:\n2\nImplementation of Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information\n(December 29, 2005). \n See Attorney Sheldon I. Cohen\u2019s several articles on the origin, history, and repeal of 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986, the\n3\nso-called Smith Amendment, at www.sheldoncohen.com/publications. \n2\nThe Revised Guidelines were then modified by the Defense Department, effective\nSeptember 1, 2006. They supersede or replace the guidelines published in Enclosure 2\nto the Directive. They apply to all adjudications and other determinations where an SOR\nhas been issued on September 1, 2006, or thereafter.  The Directive is pending revision\n2\nor amendment. The Revised Guidelines apply here because the SOR is dated after the\neffective date.  \nApplicant\u2019s Answer to the SOR was received on February 5, 2008, and he\nrequested a hearing. The case was assigned to me on March 7, 2008. At the request of\nApplicant\u2019s counsel, the hearing took place on June 26, 2008. The transcript (Tr.) was\nreceived on July 7, 2008.\nProcedural Rulings\nThe government moved to withdraw the criminal conduct allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.d,\nwhich alleged that Applicant was disqualified as a matter of law from having a security\nclearance granted or renewed by the Defense Department under 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 986 (as\namended).  The statute was repealed effective January 1, 2008, several days before\n3\nthe SOR was issued to Applicant. Accordingly, the motion was granted.   \nFindings of Fact\nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleges the following criminal conduct: (1) an arrest\nfor third-degree burglary, theft, and receiving stolen property, all felonies, in October\n1981, which resulted in a sentence to incarceration; (2) an arrest for third-degree\nburglary, a felony, in April 1982; (3) an arrest for assault \u2013 domestic violence/ third-\ndegree harassment stemming from an incident with his wife in May 2004; and (4) a\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 by making a false statement to a federal agency as set\nforth under Guideline E. The SOR alleges under Guideline E that Applicant gave false\nanswers in response to two questions about his police record when he completed a\nsecurity-clearance application in April 2007. In his Answer, Applicant admitted the three\narrests and denied the falsifications. Based on the record evidence as a whole, the\nfollowing facts are established by substantial evidence.\nApplicant is a 44-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He has worked for\nhis current employer since April 2006. His recent employment record reflects average to\nabove average performance (Exhibits A, B, and C). He is seeking to retain an industrial\nsecurity clearance that he has held for several years, since about 1996.  \n\n The term nolle pros is a verb form of nolle prosequi, which \u201cdenotes either (1) the legal notice of\n4\nabandonment of suit, or (2) a docket entry showing that the plaintiff or the prosecution has relinquished the\naction.\u201d Bryan A. Garner, A Dictionary of Modern Legal Usage 591 (2  ed., Oxford University Press 1995).\nnd\n3\nApplicant has been married twice. His first marriage ended in a divorce in 1997.\nHe married the second time in 2002. Applicant has two children from his first marriage,\nhis wife has one from a previous marriage, and together they have one child. There are\ncurrently three children living in the household. \nApplicant graduated from high school in about June 1981. Since then, he has\nattended college periodically without earning a degree. He is now enrolled in an online\ncollege, and his goal is to obtain a business degree (Exhibit D).\nApplicant has a history of criminal conduct (Exhibits 2, 3, 4, and 5). In October\n1981, shortly after finishing high school, the then 18-year-old Applicant was arrested for\nthe first time. He and a friend got together and decided to break into a neighbor\u2019s home\nand steal items in an effort to collect on a debt (Tr. 41\u201342). The police were called and\ninvestigated. The police asked Applicant if he knew anything about the incident and he\nadmitted his involvement (Tr. 42). He was arrested and charged with third-degree\nburglary, theft, and receiving stolen property (Exhibit 4). His parents hired an attorney to\nrepresent Applicant and the case proceeded accordingly.\nOn April 19, 1982, Applicant appeared in court with his attorney and applied for\ntreatment as a youthful offender (Exhibit 4 at 1). The case was continued until June 14,\n1982 for a youthful offender hearing and/or trial. \nFive days later on April 24, the then 18-year-old Applicant was arrested for the\nsecond time and charged with third-degree burglary. The charge stemmed from an\nincident where Applicant and two others were discovered in a sports facility after hours\n(Tr. 43\u201344).  \nOn June 14, 1982, the initial case against Applicant was continued (Exhibit 4 at\n1). Subsequently, both cases were disposed of in September 1982 when the then 19-\nyear-old Applicant appeared in court with his attorney and pleaded guilty to an amended\ncharge of third-degree burglary stemming from the first case. The court found him guilty\nand sentenced him to imprisonment in the state penitentiary for five years. In addition,\nthe court ordered restitution and requested that Applicant be incarcerated at a youth\ncenter. The second case of third-degree burglary was nolle prossed  based on his guilty\n4\nplea in the first case. Applicant was incarcerated in a youth center from about October\n1, 1982, until paroled on January 9, 1984, a period of nearly 14 months. The court\u2019s\npaperwork does not indicate the disposition of Applicant\u2019s youthful-offender application\n(Exhibit 4). \nApplicant was arrested for the third time in May 2004. The arrest stemmed from\nan argument with his wife that ended with Applicant slapping his wife twice. She called\nthe police after the second slap. The police arrived at the home and met Applicant\n\n Department of Navy v.

He was placed under arrest, handcuffed, and taken to the local police station\nwhere he was processed and held for about 12 hours.  He was charged with assault \u2013\ndomestic violence/third-degree harassment. He and his wife went to court in June 2004,\nand Applicant agreed to enter a domestic violence intervention program. The case was\ndeferred while he was in the program. He completed the program\u2019s requirements on\nDecember 1, 2004. As a result, the criminal case against Applicant was nolle prossed\non December 8, 2004, when the court granted the prosecution\u2019s motion (Exhibit E).   \nApplicant completed a security-clearance application in April 2007 (Exhibit 1). In\ndoing so, he was required to answer Question 23, which is a six-part question seeking\ninformation about a person\u2019s police record. The instruction for the question provides that\ninformation must be reported regardless of whether the record in the case has been\nsealed or otherwise stricken from the court record except for certain convictions for\ncontrolled-substance offenses under federal law.  Applicant answered all six parts of\nQuestion 23 in the negative, thereby denying any police record within the scope of the\nquestions. In particular, he answered \u201cno\u201d to the following two questions:\n\u2022\nQuestion 23a\u2013Have you ever been charged with or convicted of any felony\noffense?\n\u2022\nQuestion 23f\u2013In the last seven years, have you been arrested for, charged with,\nor convicted of any offenses not listed in response to Questions 23a\u201323e, except\nfor traffic fines of less than $150 unless it was alcohol or drug related?\nHe did not report that he was charged with felonies, he did not report his conviction for\nthird-degree burglary, and he did not report his 2004 domestic-violence arrest. No\nmention of these matters was made anywhere in his security-clearance application. \nPolicies\nThis section sets forth the general principles of law and policies that apply to an\nindustrial security clearance case. To start, no one has a right to a security clearance.5\nAs noted by the Supreme Court in 1988 in the case of Department of Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe\nclearly consistent standard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if\nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d  A favorable decision establishes eligibility of an\n6\napplicant to be granted a security clearance for access to confidential, secret, or top-\nsecret information.  An unfavorable decision: (1) denies any application; (2)  revokes\n7\nany existing security clearance; and (3) prevents access to classified information at any\n\n Directive, \u00b6 3.2. \n8\n ISCR Case No. 02-18663 (App. Bd.

Dec. 19, 2002) (citations omitted).\n14\n Executive Order 10865, \u00a7 7.\n15\n5\nlevel.  Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt about whether\n8\nan applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be resolved in favor\nof protecting national security.\nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for\naccess to classified information.  The government has the burden of presenting\n9\nevidence to establish facts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted.  An\n10\napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate\nfacts that have been admitted or proven.  In addition, an applicant has the ultimate\n11\nburden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision.  In Egan, the Supreme\n12\nCourt stated that the burden of proof is less than a preponderance of the evidence.13\nThe agency appellate authority has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s\nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.14\nThe Revised Guidelines set forth adjudicative guidelines to consider when\nevaluating a person\u2019s security clearance eligibility, including disqualifying conditions\n(DC) and mitigating conditions (MC) for each guideline. In addition, each clearance\ndecision must be a fair and impartial commonsense decision based upon consideration\nof all the relevant and material information, the pertinent criteria and adjudication\nfactors, and the whole-person concept. A person granted access to classified\ninformation enters into a special relationship with the government. The government\nmust be able to have a high degree of trust and confidence in those persons to whom it\ngrants access to classified information. The decision to deny a person a security\nclearance is not a determination of an applicant\u2019s loyalty.  Instead, it is a determination\n15\nthat the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President has established for\ngranting eligibility for a security clearance.\n\n Revised Guidelines at 10\u201312 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n16\nconditions).  \n Revised Guidelines at 10.\n17\n6\nAnalysis\nPersonal conduct under Guideline E  includes issues of false statements and\n16\ncredible adverse information that may not be enough to support action under any other\nguideline. In particular, a security concern may arise due to:\nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or\nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations [that may] raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to\nprotect classified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide\ntruthful and candid answers during the security clearance process or any\nother failure to cooperate with the security clearance process.  \n17\nA statement is false when it is made deliberately (knowingly and willfully). An\nomission of relevant and material information is not deliberate if the person genuinely\nforgot about it, inadvertently overlooked it, misunderstood the question, or genuinely\nthought the information did not need to be reported. \nThe gravamen of the SOR is the truthfulness of Applicant\u2019s answers to Question\n23 in his security-clearance application, as it is undisputed that he was required to\nreport the felony charges, the felony conviction, and the more recent domestic-violence\narrest. He denies that his responses to Question 23 were intentionally false. For\nQuestion 23a about felony charges or convictions, Applicant contends that his answer\nwas based on his understanding of youthful-offender status or a misunderstanding of\ndisclosure requirements (Answer). For Question 23f about other offenses within the last\nseven years, Applicant contends that his answer was based on his understanding of\nnolle prosse or perhaps a misunderstanding (Answer). In his hearing testimony,\nApplicant further explained that he answered these two questions the way he thought\nhe was supposed to answer (Tr. 59\u201363). \nHis contentions and explanations are not credible. First, the youthful-offender\nstatus is not supported by the record because there is no indication that youthful-\noffender application was granted or denied. And his explanation, based on the youthful-\noffender status, is a non sequitur because Applicant was required to report any felony\ncharge, regardless of disposition.   \nSecond, given his age, background, and experience in the defense industry, he\nhad to know that his police record might be a problem for his security clearance. He\nsimply omitted the information hoping he would pass, as apparently he had before (he\nhas held a security clearance since about 1996). It is simply too difficult to believe that a\nman of his age, background, and experience\u2014who pleaded guilty to a burglary at the\n\n DC 1 is the \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from any personnel security\n18\nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct investigations, determine\nemployment qualifications, award benefits or status, determine security clearance eligibility or trustworthiness,\nor award fiduciary responsibilities.\u201d\n Revised Guidelines at 21\u201322 (setting forth the security concern and the disqualifying and mitigating\n19\nconditions). \n Revised Guidelines at 21. \n20\n DC 1 is \u201ca single serious crime or multiple lesser offenses.\u201d\n21\n DC 3 is the \u201callegation or admission of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally\n22\ncharged, formally prosecuted or convicted.\u201d\n7\nage of 19 and served more than a year of confinement followed by a period of\nparole\u2014could genuinely believe that it was correct and proper to submit a security-\nclearance application without mentioning his police record. This is also the case for the\nrelatively recent domestic-violence arrest in May 2004. The record evidence does not\nsupport a conclusion that Applicant misunderstood either question, genuinely thought\nthe information did not need to be reported, or made an honest mistake. His\nexplanations are merely after-the-fact rationalizations. But the record evidence does\nsupport a conclusion that he deliberately omitted, concealed, or falsified material facts\nabout his police record.   \n18\nAll of the MC under Guideline E have been reviewed and none apply in\nApplicant\u2019s favor. Making false statements to the federal government during the\nsecurity-clearance process is serious misconduct, and it is not easily explained away,\nextenuated, or mitigated. Accordingly, Guideline E is decided against Applicant. \nUnder Guideline J for criminal conduct,  the concern is that \u201ccriminal activity\n19\ncreates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very\nnature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules,\nand regulations.\u201d  \n20\nIn general, a security concern is raised by Applicant\u2019s history of criminal conduct.\nIn particular, DC 1  and DC 3  apply against Applicant as evidenced by his three\n21\n22\narrests, several charges, and burglary conviction. In addition, as described above,\nApplicant violated federal criminal law (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001) in 2007 when he gave false\nanswers on his security-clearance application. To sum up, the totality of the criminal\nconduct calls into question Applicant\u2019s judgment as well as his ability or willingness to\ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline also contains several conditions that could mitigate security\nconcerns. All the MC have been considered and none apply in Applicant\u2019s favor. In\nparticular, due consideration was given to the passage of time since Applicant\u2019s\noffenses in the early 1980s and 2004 as well as the evidence of reform and\nrehabilitation. But these circumstances are negated by Applicant\u2019s recent criminal\n\n8\nconduct in 2007 when he falsified his security-clearance application. Accordingly,\nGuideline J is decided against Applicant.\nTo conclude, Applicant did not present sufficient evidence to rebut, explain,\nextenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. Applicant did not meet his ultimate burden\nof persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance decision. In reaching this conclusion, the\nwhole-person concept (to include his good employment record and his favorable\ncharacter witnesses) was given due consideration and that analysis does not support a\nfavorable decision. \nIn addition, I acknowledge that an adverse clearance decision may have negative\nconsequences on Applicant\u2019s current employment, his future employment, and his\nability to provide for his family. Nevertheless, the agency appeal board has consistently\nruled that the adverse impact of a clearance decision on an applicant\u2019s personal\nsituation is not relevant and material to security clearance eligibility. Accordingly, any\npotential negative consequences have not been considered. This case is decided\nagainst Applicant. \nFormal Findings\nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR,\nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:\nParagraph 1, Guideline J:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a, 1.b, 1,c, 1,e:  \nAgainst Applicant\nSubparagraph 1.d:\nWithdrawn\nParagraph 2, Guideline E:\nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.a, 2b:\n \nAgainst Applicant\nConclusion\nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with national interest\nto grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified\ninformation is denied.  \nMichael H. Leonard\nAdministrative Judge \n",
