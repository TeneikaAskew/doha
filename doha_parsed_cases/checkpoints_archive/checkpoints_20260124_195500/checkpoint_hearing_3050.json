    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 64-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She is employed as a linguist. Applicant is married, and has three adult children. (TR at page 16 line 3 to page 19 line 6.) She attributes her current financial difficulties to difficulties in finding employment as a deployed linguist because of her age. (TR at page 19 line 10 to page 26 line 12.) Guideline F - Financial Considerations 1.a. Applicant admits that she has a past-due debt to Creditor A in the amount of about $6,733. Since the end of 2019, Applicant has been making monthly payments of $75 towards this debt, as evidenced by documentation from a successor creditor to this debt. Her current balance is $6,057.

Since the end of 2019, Applicant has been making monthly payments of \n$75 towards this debt, as evidenced by documentation from a successor creditor to this \ndebt. Her current balance is $6,057.

Despite having been given a month to address this admitted debt, \nApplicant has submitted nothing further in this regard. This allegation is found against \nApplicant. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations \nApplicant has admitted past-due indebtedness totaling about $38,000. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise these disqualifying conditions. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are ongoing. Although she has addressed her \ndelinquencies to one of her admitted creditors, Applicant has left two, with debts totaling \nover $30,000, unanswered. Mitigation under AG \u00b6 20 has not been established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is \nwell respected in the workplace. (AppXs C~G.) She performs well at her job. However, \noverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant failed to mitigate the Financial Considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b. and 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nRichard A. Cefola \nAdministrative Judge \n5 \n",

His \nadmissions are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nThe SOR also alleges foreign preference security concerns based on Applicant\u2019s \nintent to permanently relocate his family to Djibouti (SOR \u00b6 2.a.) and his active \nmembership in the Movement of Democratic Renewal (MRD), a Djibouti opposition party \n(SOR \u00b6 2.b.). Applicant denied both Guideline C allegations. After a careful review of the \npleadings, hearing transcript, and exhibits, I make the following findings of fact: \nApplicant is 43 years old. He was born in Djibouti. He married his spouse in Djibouti \nin 2006. He entered the U.S. in 2013, and both he and his wife became naturalized U.S. \ncitizens in 2019. They have three children, one a naturalized U.S. citizen, and the other \ntwo U.S. citizens by virtue of their birth in the United States. His employment offer for a \nlinguist position with a federal contractor is contingent on his eligibility for a DOD security \nclearance. (GE 1, GE 2, GE 3; Tr. 23, 73) \nApplicant has regular contact with some of his family members in Djibouti, and he \ntalks with his sister approximately twice monthly. His spouse has frequent, almost daily, \ncontact with her mother and some of her siblings. Over the years he has been contacted \nby several nieces, nephews, siblings, and his spouse\u2019s siblings for financial support. He \nhas provided occasional financial assistance to these family members, and he has \nprovided regular financial support ($200-$300 monthly) to his mother-in-law since 2013. \nSeveral family members are civil servants employed by the government of Djibouti, two \nserve in the Djibouti military, and one serves for the Republican Guard. (GE 1, GE 2, GE \n3; Tr. 23-46) \nIn approximately 2002, while Applicant worked in Djibouti as a teacher, he joined \nthe MRD, a political party opposed to the current Djibouti government. The MRD was \ndeclared illegal by the Djibouti government. In 2010, Applicant was arrested for being an \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nactivist in the MRD. He was held in prison awaiting trial. After being incarcerated for about \na month in inhumane conditions, his family was able to have Applicant released while his \ntrial was pending. He immediately fled the country and illegally entered Ethiopia to escape \nhis pending criminal trial and possible imprisonment. After about two months, he illegally \nre-entered Djibouti, and hid himself from police while waiting to hear the status of his wife \nand daughter, who had left Djibouti, and applied for asylum in the United States. In April \n2012, he secretly left Djibouti and illegally crossed over to Ethiopia with the help of drug \nsmugglers. For approximately one year he worked with the U.S. Embassy in Ethiopia until \nhe was eventually provided travel documents to enter the U.S. based on a spousal visa. \n(Tr. 47-62, 66-67; GE 2, GE 3) \nIn September 2010, Applicant\u2019s wife and their two-year-old daughter entered the \nUnited States on a tourist visa. His wife was about two months pregnant at the time. She \napplied for asylum due to political persecution in Djibouti, which was granted by the U.S. \nShe remained in the United States while Applicant was a fugitive, secretly hiding and \ntraveling between Ethiopia and Djibouti to avoid police detection. His spouse sponsored \nApplicant to come to the U.S. In March 2013, Applicant arrived in the U.S. and rejoined \nhis family. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in September 2019. (Tr. 63-71; GE 2, \nGE 3) \n \n \nApplicant did not go to trial for his pending criminal charge in Djibouti. Since April \n2012, he has never returned to that country. It is his belief that if he did return to Djibouti \nin the future he would no longer be considered a fugitive by the Djibouti government since \nhe was not an important or high-ranking leader in the MRD. The mission of MRD is to \npromote democratic values. In Djibouti there are restrictive voter-registration laws, and \nthe elections are not fair. He continued to participate in the MRD upon his arrival in the \nU.S. in 2013, but he stopped all participation in the MRD in 2018. It is his intention to \ncontinue to promote democratic values, not only to the people of Djibouti, but also to the \npeople in Africa living in countries that are not democratic. He believed his status as a \nU.S. citizen also bolstered his conviction to make all governments fair through the means \nof democracy. (Tr. 58-63; GE 2; AE A) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s January 2020 background interview, he told the DOD \nauthorized investigator that after his 2010 arrest, he went into hiding for about ten days, \nbut he was picked up by the police again. He was fingerprinted and released. He told the \ninvestigator that the reason he was smuggled by drug dealers out of Djibouti was due to \nhim being a teacher, since it was illegal for teachers to leave the country. During the \nhearing Department Counsel questioned Applicant about why he failed to mention to the \ninvestigator that he illegally fled the country due to a pending criminal trial for his \nparticipation in an illegal opposition political party and his fear of imprisonment in Djibouti. \nApplicant responded that he did not recall that information at the time he participated in \nhis background interview. (Tr. 72-76; GE 3) \nApplicant also told the investigator during his January 2020 background interview \nthat he did not want to renounce his Djibouti citizenship because possibly one day he \nwould like to return to Djibouti, perhaps even retire there. His loyalty was equally divided \nbetween Djibouti and the United States. During another interview Applicant stated that \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrenouncing his foreign citizenship would prevent him from being an effective advocate for \nthe Djibouti people. In his June 2021 response to DOHA interrogatories, Applicant \nreported that Djibouti is currently unsafe for him and his family. The only way he would \nlive in this country again depended on the establishment of a new democratic government \nin Djibouti free from dictatorship. (GE 3; Tr. 82-89) \nIn November 2020, Applicant participated in a counterintelligence (CI) interview by \nthe U.S. Army. During the interview Applicant told the investigator that his wife applied for \nasylum in the U.S. due to her being a woman educator (not due to political persecution). \nApplicant was asked if he had ever been in any country illegally; if he had ever served in \nany foreign political party; had he ever been held against his will by a foreign government; \nand whether he had ever been arrested, held, detained, or imprisoned in any country? \nApplicant responded \u201cNO\u201d to all of the questions listed above. He failed to disclose his \n2010 arrest in Djibouti; being held in a severely over-crowded jail for approximately one \nmonth before he was released; and his fleeing from the country to avoid prosecution in a \npending criminal trial with possible imprisonment. (GE 2) \nDuring the hearing, Applicant stated that if the U.S. government wanted him to \nrenounce his Djibouti citizenship in order to receive a DOD security clearance, he would \nbe willing to do so. He also stated his loyalty was to the U.S. only. Department Counsel \nquestioned Applicant about his significant change of heart concerning his earlier \nstatements provided during his background investigation. Applicant testified that he \nchanged his mind about his previous beliefs after he received the SOR. (Tr. 82-89) \nAdministrative Notice \nI have taken administrative notice of the following facts concerning Djibouti: \nThe 2020 Humans Rights report identified Djibouti as a republic with a strong \nelected president and a weak legislature. Djibouti has a multiparty political system in \nwhich parties must be registered and recognized by the ruling authorities. There are \nrestrictive voter registration laws, voter intimidation, inadequate ballot security, and lack \nof opposition observers. Most opposition groups did not characterize the past presidential \nelections as free and fair. Political power is shared by Djibouti\u2019s two largest ethnic groups, \nthe Somali-Issas and Afars. \nSignificant human rights issues included: unlawful or arbitrary killings including \nextrajudicial killings; cases of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by \nthe government; harsh and life-threatening prison conditions; arbitrary arrest or detention; \narbitrary or unlawful interference with privacy; serious restrictions on free expression, the \npress, and the internet, including violence, threats of violence, or unjustified arrests or \nprosecutions against journalists, censorship, site blocking, and the existence of criminal \nlibel laws; substantial interference with the freedom of peaceful assembly and freedom of \nassociation; and the worst forms of child labor committed throughout the country. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe United States\u2019 extraordinary commitment to Djibouti is balanced against the \ninherent dangers of the ongoing conflict in Djibouti to its citizens and residents and \nsignificant human rights issues. (AN 1) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6 as follows: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nTwo disqualifying conditions under this guideline (AG \u00b6 7) are relevant to this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual\u2019s obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology. \n\u201cThe United States has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding \n[sensitive] information from any person, organization, or country th\n \nat is not authorized to \nhave access to it, regardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests \ninimical to those of the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, \n2004).  \nTo establish AG \u00b6 7(a), the Government must demonstrate a \u201cheightened risk\u201d of \nexploitation due to Applicant\u2019s contacts with his family members in Djibouti, some who \nare employed by the Djibouti military and Djibouti Republican Guard. Given the activities \nof the Djibouti government and significant human rights violations, together with the \npossibility that Applicant may be considered by Djibouti to be a fugitive from justice, I find \nthe Government has established the requisite \u201cheightened risk\u201d and potential conflict of \ninterest regarding Applicant\u2019s contacts with his family members in Djibouti. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a), \nand 7(b) apply. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe following mitigating conditions under this guideline (AG \u00b6 8) are potentially \nrelevant: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nNot every foreign contact or tie presents the heightened risk under AG \u00b6 7(a). The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having a family \nmember or a spouse\u2019s family member living under a foreign government. The nature and \nstrength of the family ties or other foreign interests and the country involved (i.e., the \nnature of its government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights \nrecord) are relevant in assessing whether there is a likelihood of vulnerability to \ngovernment coercion. The risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater \nif the foreign country has an authoritarian government; a family member is associated \nwith, or dependent on, the foreign government; or the country is known to conduct \nintelligence operations against the United States. In considering the nature of the foreign \ngovernment, the administrative judge must take into account any terrorist activity in the \ncountry at issue. See generally ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 7, 2006). \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, his or her immediate family members, and this presumption includes in-\nlaws. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-06030 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 19, 2008); ISCR Case No. \n05-00939 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 3, 2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-03120 at 4 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 20, 2002).   \nApplicant has regular contact with some of his family members living in Djibouti, \nand he has frequent contact with his sister. Applicant and his spouse were born in Djibouti, \nand she also has frequent contact with her family members. Together they have family \nmembers who have served in or been employed by the Djibouti military and government. \nHe has also provided financial support to his family members over the years, and he \ncurrently provides financial support to his mother-in-law.

The evidence shows that Applicant did not provide full and candid \ninformation during his security investigation about his 2010 arrest in Djibouti due to his \nillegal association with the MRD, and his unlawful entries and exits between Djibouti and \nEthiopia in order to escape his pending trial. His failure to fully disclose these facts during \nhis investigation, when required, taken together with his family members living in Djibouti, \nshows that he is subject to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation. \nOverall, the facts show there is a possibility that Applicant could be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of his foreign family members and the \ninterests of the United States. His ties to the United States, established over only the last \nnine years, are not enough to fully mitigate the risk of undue foreign influence. AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n8(a), 8(b), and 8(c) do not apply. \nGuideline C, Foreign Preference \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 9 as follows: \nWhen an individual acts in such a way as to indicate a preference for a \nforeign country over the United States, then he or she may provide \ninformation or make decisions that are harmful to the interests of the United \nStates. Foreign involvement raises concerns about an individual\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness when it is in conflict with U.S. \nnational interests or when the individual acts to conceal it. By itself; the fact \nthat a U.S. citizen is also a citizen of another country is not disqualifying \nwithout an objective showing of such conflict or attempt at concealment. \nThe same is true for a U.S. citizen\u2019s exercise of any right or privilege of \nforeign citizenship and any action to acquire or obtain recognition of a \nforeign citizenship. \nAlthough the SOR alleged that Applicant intended to permanently relocate his \nfamily to Djibouti, Applicant has denied this statement and there is no evidence in the \nrecord to support the allegation. During his January 2020 background interview, Applicant \nstated that maybe one day he would return to Djibouti, possibly to retire. Applicant clarified \nhis statement by testifying that the only way he would return to Djibouti to live was if the \ngovernment of Djibouti is democratic and not ruled by a dictator. Djibouti now is not safe \nfor him or his family. (GE 3) \nThe SOR also alleged that Applicant remained a member of a Djibouti opposition \nparty, (MRD), after relocating to the United States. Although he is no longer a member of \nthe MRD, it is important to note that the mission of the MRD is to promote democratic and \nfair representation of the people, which is in conflict with the ruling government of Djibouti, \nbut not in conflict with U.S. national interests. Applicant testified that it is his hope to \npromote democratic values not only to the people of Djibouti, but to all people in Africa \nliving in a country without the benefit of a fair democratic process. Applicant has \nsuccessfully refuted the foreign preference security concerns. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the adjudicative guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline \nB, Guideline C, and the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) in this whole-person analysis. \nApplicant\u2019s connections to Djibouti are substantial and ongoing. Applicant\u2019s \nrelationship with the United States must be weighed against the potential conflict of \ninterest created by his relationships with relatives who are citizens and residents of \nDjibouti. His and his spouse\u2019s families reside in Djibouti, and some of these family \nmembers serve in the Djibouti military or are employed by the Djibouti government. Like \nevery other resident of Djibouti, they are at risk from human rights violations by the \nDjibouti government. His and his spouse\u2019s relationships with residents of Djibouti raise \nsignificant foreign influence security concerns. \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. Although Applicant successfully refuted \nforeign preference security concerns, I conclude foreign influence concerns are not \nmitigated.

He did not provide any evidence of \npayments. Any doubts must be resolved in favor of the Government. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants national security eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or \nsensitive information. Finally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO \n10865, \u201cAny \ndetermination under this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and, \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d) . \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by any of the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant has unresolved delinquent debts that are \nnot paid. The debts are recent. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not established. Applicant reported no circumstances beyond his \ncontrol. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are not established. Applicant did not provide any \ndocumentation of obtaining financial counseling or evidence of any good-faith efforts to \nshow what he has done to address the debts. He did not provide documentation of any \nkind to support his claims. That is not sufficient mitigation in this case. \nApplicant failed to meet his burden to mitigate the financial concerns set out in the \nSOR due to insufficient evidence and documentation. For these reasons, I find he has not \nmitigated the security concerns under the financial considerations guideline. After \nconsidering the mitigating conditions outlined above, none of them apply in this case. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \napplicable guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. \nAn administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \n\u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F and in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context \nof the whole person, including Applicant\u2019s military service, I conclude that Applicant has \nnot presented evidence of mitigation under the financial considerations guideline. \nClearance is denied. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \n\u00b6 1, Guideline F Financial Considerations):  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1:a-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \n   Conclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information under the financial consideration \nguideline.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the SOR factual allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.s). However, at hearing, she disputed all the delinquent medical accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g through 1.s. Her documentation established that she was injured at work, filed for workmen\u2019s compensation, and received disability payments. She claimed all medical expenses were supposed to be paid under her disability claim. Based on her testimony and evidence, I found for Applicant under SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g through 1.s. Applicant\u2019s SOR admissions, and those at her hearing, are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant is 39 years old. She graduated from high school in 2001, and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2005. She married in 2009 and divorced in 2017. She has a nine- year-old disabled son (autistic-nonverbal). Applicant was employed between 2006 and 2013. Her son was born in March 2013. She testified she was in disability-maternity leave between March and September 2013. (Tr. 18-19) When her maternity leave ended and she was not able to return to work, her employer terminated her employment. She was hired in June 2014 and was employed until February 2019. She testified that between March 2019 and October 2020, she had two operations and was placed under the protection of the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) and placed on long-term-disability (LTD).

Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted her first security clearance application (SCA) on October 2, \n2020, and an investigator from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) interviewed \nher on December 9, 2020. After reviewing the information gathered during the \nbackground investigation, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DCSA CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging security concerns under Guideline F (financial considerations) on July 21, 2021. \nApplicant answered the SOR on July 22, 2021, submitted a one-page document, and \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe case was assigned to me on March 18, 2022. The Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) issued a notice of video teleconference hearing (NOH) on April 18, \n2022, scheduling the hearing for May 18, 2022. \nPrior to the hearing, the Government submitted Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5, which I \nadmitted into the record without objection. GE 5 is the Government\u2019s discovery letter, \ndated September 13, 2021, which was marked and admitted into the record, but it is not \nsubstantive evidence. \nApplicant testified, as reflected in the transcript received on May 27, 2022. Post-\nhearing, Applicant submitted emails dated May 18 and June 3 2022, with documents, \nwhich I collectively marked as Applicant Exhibit (AE) A, and admitted into the record \nwithout objections. \nProcedural Issue \nAt the end of the hearing, I amended SOR \u00b6 1.a by deleting the years 2018 and \n2019, and substituting the years 2012 and 2020, respectively. The amendment brought \nthe SOR allegation in conformity with the evidence presented. (Tr. 28-30; 43-44) \nFindings of Fact \nIn her answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted all the SOR factual allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a through 1.s). However, at hearing, she disputed all the delinquent medical accounts \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g through 1.s. Her documentation established that she was injured \nat work, filed for workmen\u2019s compensation, and received disability payments. She claimed \nall medical expenses were supposed to be paid under her disability claim. Based on her \ntestimony and evidence, I found for Applicant under SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g through 1.s.  \nApplicant\u2019s SOR admissions, and those at her hearing, are incorporated herein as \nfindings of fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following \nadditional findings of fact: \nApplicant is 39 years old. She graduated from high school in 2001, and earned a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in 2005. She married in 2009 and divorced in 2017. She has a nine-\nyear-old disabled son (autistic-nonverbal).  \nApplicant was employed between 2006 and 2013. Her son was born in March \n2013. She testified she was in disability-maternity leave between March and September \n2013. (Tr. 18-19) When her maternity leave ended and she was not able to return to work, \nher employer terminated her employment. She was hired in June 2014 and was employed \nuntil February 2019. She testified that between March 2019 and October 2020, she had \ntwo operations and was placed under the protection of the Family Medical Leave Act \n(FMLA) and placed on long-term-disability (LTD).

She is making about $85,000 a year. (Tr. 26) In Section 26 (Financial \nRecord) of her 2020 SCA, Applicant disclosed that she had financial problems that \nincluded owing income taxes to her state and a car repossessed in 2017. \nApplicant explained that her financial problems resulted from her period of \nseparation and divorce, her periods of medical disability when she was earning only 60 \npercent of her salary, underemployment, and the expensive, special medical treatment \nand medicines required for her disabled son. \nApplicant stated she filed federal income tax returns for tax years (TY) 2007 \nthrough 2011. She did not file federal income tax returns for TY 2012 through 2021. She \ndid not file state income tax returns for TY 2018 through 2019. She owes her state about \n$14,000 for taxes, as evidenced by liens filed against her in 2007, 2015, and 2016. As of \nher hearing date, Applicant had not filed her delinquent federal or state income tax \nreturns. She had not contacted the state tax authority to establish a payment plan to pay \nher delinquent income taxes. She testified that she owes her state income taxes for TY \n2008 through 2021. (Tr. 21) \nApplicant averred she was not sure whether she had to file federal or state income \ntax returns for some of the years in question because she was only making a little over \n$30,000 a year from her disability payments. According to IRS regulations, in 2012, a \nperson making over $9,750 gross income had to file an income tax return, and in 2021, \nthe filing threshold was $12,550 gross income. Applicant did not present documentary \nevidence to show she was below the IRS or her state filing threshold for the years in \nquestion. \nWhen asked at her hearing why she did not file her federal and state income tax \nreturns, Applicant testified that after her son was born in 2013, he became her first priority \nand filing her tax returns was not a priority. She claimed she did not have the financial \nmeans to pay an accountant or tax preparer, or to pay her taxes. Because of her low \nincome, she was more concerned about paying the family\u2019s living expenses than her \ndebts. She noted that the expenses associated with her divorce, her and her son\u2019s \nmedical problems, her periods of unemployment and underemployment, and she being \nthe sole provider for her family made her financial situation difficult. \nApplicant claimed a prospective employer offered her a job paying over $100,000, \nprovided she is eligible for a clearance. She believes that if she is granted clearance \neligibility, she will be able to resolve all of her financial problems. She noted she was been \nupfront and truthful during the clearance process. Her intent is to file all her delinquent \nincome tax returns and pay her delinquent taxes. She acknowledged there were periods \nwhere she could have been more proactive addressing her taxes and her delinquent \ndebts. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges an unpaid judgment for $294 filed against Applicant in 2019. \nShe claimed she received the court notice sometime during the pandemic and started to \ninvestigate the collection. She claimed she called the creditor two weeks before her \nhearing to discuss a settlement. She presented no documentary evidence of her contacts \nwith the creditor. She has not paid the judgment. (Tr. 33) \nAt hearing, Applicant disputed all the delinquent medical accounts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.g through 1.s. Her documentation established that she was injured at work, filed for \nworkmen\u2019s compensation several times, and received disability payments. She is in the \nprocess of disputing the collections and resubmitting her medical bills to her worker\u2019s \ncompensation insurance carrier. Based on her testimony and evidence, I considered SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.g through 1.s mitigated. (Tr. 36 \u2013 41) \nShe promised to be financially responsible in the future. She presented no \nevidence to show that she is following a budget or that she has participated in financial \ncounseling. Applicant was honest and upfront during the security clearance process and \ndisclosed her tax issues and financial problems in her 2020 SCA, during her background \ninvestigation interview with government investigators, and at her hearing. \nPolicies \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June 8, 2017. \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The \nU.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in \nregulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno one \nhas a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 \n(1988). \nThe AGs list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition \nis not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AGs should be followed where a case can be \nmeasured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to classified \ninformation. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration \nof the whole person and the factors listed in Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) \n4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and 2(f).

The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, the \nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling\ninterest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and\ntrustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. The \u201cclearly\nconsistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt\nabout an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \u201c[S]ecurity\nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S.\nat 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance decisions are not\na determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are merely an indication\nthat the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the Government has established\nfor issuing a clearance. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems:  \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . ..  \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances.

She failed to timely \nfile federal income tax returns for TY 2012 through 2020, and state tax returns for TY \n2018 and 2019. She owes her state about $14,000 for unpaid taxes as evidenced by liens \nfiled against her in 2007, 2015, and 2016. Additionally, she has an unpaid $294 judgment \nfiled against her in 2019. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts;\u201d \u201c(c) a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations;\u201d and \u201c(f) failure to file . . . annual Federal, state, or local income tax \nreturns . . . or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d The \nrecord established these disqualifying conditions, requiring additional inquiry about the \npossible applicability of mitigating conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance.

After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013). \nApplicant stated that her failure to file her income tax returns, pay the tax liens, \nand pay the judgment was caused by a combination of factors. After her son was born in \n2013, he became her first priority and filing her tax returns was not a priority. She did not \nhave the financial means to pay an accountant or tax preparer, or to pay her taxes. \nBecause of her low earnings, she was more concerned about paying the family\u2019s living \nexpenses than her debts. She noted that the expenses associated with her divorce, her \nand her son\u2019s medical problems, her periods of unemployment and underemployment, \nand she being the sole provider for her family made her financial situation difficult. \nI have considered as circumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control her divorce, her \nand her son\u2019s medical problems, her periods of unemployment and underemployment, \nand she being the sole provider. These circumstances could have adversely affected her \nability to timely file her income tax returns, albeit for a short period, or aggravated her \nfinancial situation. I do not find her failure to file her tax returns as a circumstance beyond \nher control. \nAs of the day of her hearing, Applicant had taken no action to file her delinquent \nincome tax returns, pay her state taxes, or to pay the 2019 judgment filed against her. \nHer evidence is insufficient to establish that she has been financially responsible under \nthe circumstances. \nApplicant disclosed her tax problems in her October 2020 SCA. She also answered \nquestions about her tax problems when she was interviewed in December 2020. These \nincidents should have crystalized for Applicant the security concerns raised by her failure \nto file income tax returns, and the importance for her to do so. Notwithstanding, she has \ndone nothing to file her delinquent federal and state income tax returns and presented no \nevidence to show he has paid her state taxes. \nAbout the failure to timely file federal and state income tax returns, the DOHA \nAppeal Board has commented: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002).

She failed to establish full mitigation of the \nfinancial considerations security concerns. I am unable to find that Applicant acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that she made a good-faith effort to timely file her \nincome tax returns or pay her taxes. Applicant\u2019s financial issues are recent and ongoing. \nThey continue to cast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person concept. \nSEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). Under AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of \nwhether to grant a security clearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My \ncomments under Guideline F are incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline but some warrant additional \ncomment. \nApplicant, 39, seeks clearance eligibility for the first time. The evidence against \ngrant of Applicant\u2019s security clearance is substantial. She failed to timely file federal \nincome tax returns for many years, and she failed to pay delinquent state taxes. Her \nfinancial problems are recent and not under control. \nApplicant knew that she needed to file her federal income tax returns and pay her \nincome taxes. Whether she knew she was going to receive refunds or had sufficient or \ninsufficient funds to pay any taxes owed, she had a legal requirement to timely file her tax \nreturns. She did not fully understand or appreciate the importance of timely filing of tax \nreturns in security clearance determinations. Applicant\u2019s promises of future financial \nresponsibility are insufficient to fully mitigate the financial considerations security \nconcerns. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Unmitigated financial considerations security concerns \nlead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not warranted at this \ntime. This decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g - 1.s: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant or \ncontinue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

After a review of the pleadings and \nevidence, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 47-year-old employee of a federal contractor performing the duties \nof a chief systems engineer. He began working at his present job in November 2016. He \nearned his bachelor\u2019s degree in 2008 (attending from 2004-2008), his master\u2019s degree in \n2010 (attending from 2008-2010), and his doctorate (Ph.D.) in 2016 (attending from 2011 \nto 2016).

He has seven children, including two former stepchildren \nand reported that he provides financial assistance to the younger two children. He served \nin the Air National Guard from 2009 to 2017 when he was honorably discharged. (Tr. 6, \n21-22, 24-26, 40; GE 1, 3) \nThe SOR alleged eight delinquent DOE student loans totaling approximately \n$98,042. The debts are established by a credit report from September 2020 and \nApplicant\u2019s personal subject interview (PSI) with a background investigator in November-\nDecember 2020, including documents provided by Applicant to the investigator after his \ninterview. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.h) (GE 2-3) \nApplicant\u2019s student loan history is somewhat confusing. The SOR only alleged that \nhis DOE loans were in collection status and therefore delinquent. A November 30, 2020 \nletter from a loan servicing company corroborates that the same eight DOE student loans \nlisted in the SOR were the loans Applicant sought to rehabilitate. An August 9, 2021 letter \nto Applicant from DOE indicated that the same eight student loans were successfully \nrehabilitated. As for the student loans serviced by the PL, correspondence to the \nApplicant from the PL indicated that 11 student loans (with different loan numbers and \namounts due versus his DOE loans) were placed into a \u201cforbearance\u201d status for \nnonpayment on November 25, 2020. (Since these delinquent student loans were not \nalleged in the SOR, I will not consider them for disqualification purposes, but I may \nconsider them in determining the applicability of any mitigating conditions and in making \nassessments using the whole-person factors.) (GE 2, see attached thereto documents \nlabeled \u201cAttachment 1, Item 003, Page 3, 4, 8, 9 of 9\u201d; Answer to SOR attachment \nthereto). \nApplicant testified that his undergraduate student loans were deferred during his \nmilitary service. During his background interview, he stated that he never made any \npayments toward his PL student loans before or after his military service.

(Tr. at 22-23; GE 2 (PSI p. 3)) \nDuring his testimony, Applicant claimed that earlier in April 2022 he made his first \npayment of $289, under what he believed was the total consolidation of all his student \nloans, including both from DOE and the PL. I asked Applicant to provide documentation \nof this payment and documentation showing the latest payment agreement he had \nconcerning his student loans. Applicant responded with a post-hearing email dated May \n20, 2022. (See AE A1-A25) Listed in Applicant\u2019s email as an item attached thereto was a \ndocument he called \u201cProof of payment toward Student Loan.\u201d However, the supporting \ndocumentation does not show the April student-loan payment of $289 he referenced in \nhis hearing testimony. Moreover, none of the documents comprising AE A1- A25 show \nany agreements toward paying his student loans, or any actual payments toward his \nstudent loans. What the documentation shows is that Applicant entered an agreement \nwith a commercial service to submit requests on his behalf seeking student loan \nconsolidation or requests for repayment plans. The agreement called for Applicant to \nmake monthly payments of $248 from April 2022 through September 2022, followed by \nmonthly payments of $39 from October 2022 to March 2023. These payments are called \n\u201cdocument preparation services and fees\u201d of this company and do not go toward any \nstudent-loan payments. (AE A8) One of the documents (AE A15) is a request for \nadditional forbearance and a request to stop making payments because of \u201cfinancial \ndifficulties.\u201d None of these documents, or any other documentation in the record, show \npayments toward Applicant\u2019s DOE or Pl student loans. The documents show that his total \nstudent-loan debt is greater than $160,000. (AE A 24) (AE A1-A25) \nApplicant provided spreadsheets for April and May 2022, listing his monthly \nexpenses for each month. It is not a budget because it does not track his income against \nhis expenses. Both months show expenses of $248, which he labels as \u201cschool loan,\u201d but \nwhich is for the payment of the document preparation services for the commercial service. \nThere are no other entries for student-loan payments. The spreadsheet also shows \nApplicant is making minimal monthly payments on 12 credit cards. The combined balance \non those cards is approximately $34,000. An earlier budget from November 2020 that \nApplicant submitted during his background interview, shows that he was operating at a \nmonthly deficit after paying all his expenses for the month. (GE 2, see attached thereto \ndocuments labeled \u201cAttachment 1, Item 002, Page 1 of 5\u201d; AE B1-B2) \nApplicant provided letters from two coworkers in support of Applicant seeking a \nleadership position in a local civic organization. They described Applicant as honest, \nforthcoming, dependable, and responsible. (AE C1-C2) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b619 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred multiple student loans beginning in approximately 2004, of \nwhich none have been paid. I find both disqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \nAlthough President Biden extended a pause on the collection of federal student \nloans due to COVID-19, thus creating a deferment period on federal student-loan \npayments \n(https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-\n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \nreleases/2021/01/20/pausing-student-loan-payments/), that action does not excuse \npreviously delinquent student loans. (See ISCR Case No. 20-01527 at 2 (App. Bd. June \n7, 2021)) \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent because they are ongoing. While Applicant should be \ncommended for his pursuit of higher education, he did so funding his education with \nstudent loans, which he has failed to pay back. Over an 18-year period, there is little to \nno evidence reflecting that he met his payment obligations on those loans. His lack of \naffirmative action to address his student loans casts doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable. \nApplicant did not describe any conditions beyond his control as contributing to not \nallowing him to pay his student loans. Even if his child-support payments fell into that \ncategory, he did not act responsibly when he took no action to address his student loans \nover an 18-year period. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully applicable. \nApplicant did not present evidence of financial counseling. His track record to date \ndoes not support a good financial picture. Additionally, he failed to put forth a good-faith \neffort to resolve his student loans. Perhaps someday, student loans such as Applicant \nincurred will be forgiven, but that day is not today. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are not \nunder control. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and AG 20(d) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nI considered Applicant\u2019s contractor experience, his honorable military service, and \nhis efforts to support his children. However, I also considered that he has made \ninsufficient efforts to resolve his student loans. He has not established a meaningful track \nrecord of debt management, which causes me to question his ability to resolve his debts. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. I \nconsidered the exceptions under Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Appendix \nC, dated June 8, 2017, and determined they are not applicable in this case. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(Items1-3) \nBecause there is a lack of documented information from Applicant in the record \nto assess what plans she has to address her SOR-listed delinquent debts (both now \nand in the future), no favorable inferences can be drawn as to any future prospects she \nmight harbor for resolving her debts. Based on the lack of any payment history and \nlimited information developed in the record to date, Applicant\u2019s payment prospects for \naddressing her delinquent accounts remain unclear at best. Absent documentation from \nApplicant of her addressing her outstanding delinquent accounts with pay-offs and \npayment plans, or successfully resolving any disputes she may still have with any of the \nlisted SOR creditors, resolution of Applicant\u2019s disputed accounts cannot be favorably \nestablished. \nPolicies \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. These AG guidelines must \nbe considered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive \nreliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in \narriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \n3 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                         \n \n \n          The Concern: Failure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of \nwhich \ncan \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated by, \nand thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personal \nsecurity concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is  \nalso a security concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, \nincluding espionage.

The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \n \n Financial Considerations\n  Burdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information.

On the strength of the evidence presented, two disqualifying \nconditions of the Adjudicative Guidelines (DCs) for financial considerations apply to \nApplicant\u2019s situation: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s admitted debt delinquencies require no independent proof to \nsubstantiate them. See Directive 5220.6 at E3. 1.1.14; McCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 262 \n(6th  ed. 2006). Her admitted debt delinquencies are fully documented and create  \njudgment issues as well over the management of her finances. See ISCR Case No. 03-\n01059 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004) \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified and sensitive \ninformation is required to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security \nclearance that entitles the person to access classified and sensitive information. While \nthe principal concern of a security clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties \nis vulnerability to coercion to classified information or to holding sensitive position, \njudgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving debt delinquencies. \nHistorically, the timing and resolving of debt delinquencies are critical to an \nassessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability and good judgment in following \nrules, regulations, and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified ad \nsensitive information or to holding a sensitive position.

Gainfully employed \nsince 2009 (except for a brief period of unemployment in December 2020), she provided \nlittle documentation as to how she budgeted and addressed her debts following her \nseparation from her ex-husband of two years in 2013. Whether her ex-husband \nprovided any financial assistance for her two children (since emancipated) is unclear. \nWhy Applicant did not begin to address her delinquent accounts in a material \nway with the resources available to her is not explained in her SOR response in \nsufficient detail to facilitate any meaningful assessments about the current condition of \nher finances and her failure to make any progress in resolving her delinquent accounts. \nWith so little financial information to work with relative to the circumstances prompting \nher to fall behind with her SOR-listed delinquent accounts and later fail to address them \nresponsibly with payments and payment plans with the income resources available to \nher from her full-time employment, no meaningful extenuation credit can be assigned to \nher at this time. \nAfforded opportunities to provide clarification of her financial conditions and \nexplanations of her lack of payment progress on her delinquent accounts, Applicant \nprovided insufficient information for (a) how she allowed her debts to become delinquent \nwith her past and current income available to her and (b) why she has failed to take \nmore documented steps to address her delinquent accounts once her finances had \nimproved. To date, she has not paid or otherwise resolved any of the listed delinquent \naccounts in the SOR. Promises (express or implied) by an applicant to pay or otherwise \nresolve delinquent debts in the future without well-developed repayment plans do not \nmeet Appeal Board requirements for establishing for establishing a track record for \npaying debts in a timely manner and otherwise acting in a responsible way. See ISCR \nCase No.  17-04110 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 26, 2019); ISCR Case No. 09-05252 at 3 (App. \nBd. Dec. 3, 2010). \nFor lack of any documented repayment or financial counseling initiatives by \nApplicant, other potentially available mitigating conditions cannot be applied to \nApplicant\u2019s situation. Based on her failure to date to establish a meaningful track record \nof addressing her delinquent accounts, it is too soon to make safe predictive \nassessments as to whether Applicant can restore her finances to stable levels \nconsistent with minimum requirements for holding a security clearance. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether Applicant\u2019s failure to adequately address her delinquent debts \nare otherwise compatible with DoD requirements for holding a security clearance.

This debt was incurred jointly by \nApplicant and his wife to buy a recreational vehicle. The account was opened in \nNovember 2015. The last payment was in May 2019. (FORM Item 4 at 4.) In Applicant\u2019s \nanswer to the SOR, he stated that the vehicle was surrendered to the bank because his \nwife would not agree to sell it. The divorce decree provides that each party is responsible \nfor 50% of this debt. (AX E.) In Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he stated that he had \ncontacted the bank about a settlement. The debt is not resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: child-support arrearage of $22,018. Based on Applicant\u2019s response \nto the SOR and the evidence in the December 2021 credit report, Department Counsel \nconceded that the security concerns raised by this debt have been mitigated. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c: car loan charged off for $8,428. In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, \nhe stated that the car was surrendered to the bank because his ex-wife would not agree \nto sell it. The divorce decree provides that each party is responsible for 50% of this debt. \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, he stated that he had agreed to start making \npayments on his portion of the debt in January 2022. He submitted some handwritten \nnotes pertaining to his promise and reflecting an agreed amount to settle the debut, but \nno documentary evidence of a payment agreement or any payments. (AX F.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d: credit-card account charged off for $1,776. In Applicant\u2019s answer \nto the SOR, he stated that he was making monthly payments on this debt. In his response \nto the FORM, he submitted evidence of monthly payments of $66 from January to \nDecember 10, 2021, shortly before he answered the SOR. (AX C.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e: home mortgage loan past due for $58,377, with an outstanding \nbalance of $723,607. Applicant\u2019s ex-wife lived in the marital home for about a year but \ndid not make any payments on the mortgage loan. Applicant lived in a recreational vehicle \ncampground during this time. (FORM Item 3 at 12.) The divorce decree required \nApplicant\u2019s ex-wife to sign a quitclaim deed for her interest in the home, but she has not \ncomplied with this requirement. (AX L.) Applicant began making monthly loan payments \nof $3,800 when he reoccupied the home, which are being applied to the past-due balance. \n(Response to FORM; AX N; FORM Item 7 at 8.)

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \n4 \n\n \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

Sep. 22, 2005).  \n \n \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the FORM establish two \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy \ndebts\u201d) and AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established. Applicant\u2019s marital breakup was a condition largely \nbeyond his control. He has acted responsibly by working multiple jobs and negotiating \nresolution of the delinquent debts that resulted from his marital breakup. \nAg \u00b6 20(d) is established for the child-support arrearage alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, \nwhich is resolved. Applicant is making regular payments on the car loan alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.c, the credit-card account alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, and the delinquent home mortgage \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e. The loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a is not resolved, but Applicant has \nbeen in contact with the creditor and proposed a settlement. The creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a is \nthe same creditor as the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.c, with whom he has an ongoing relationship \nand has successfully negotiated a settlement. \nContrary to the assertion of Department Counsel in her submission, the \nadjudicative guidelines do not require that an individual establish resolution of every debt \nalleged in the SOR, make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously, or pay the \ndebts alleged in the SOR first. An applicant is not required to be debt-free. All that is \nrequired is than an applicant act responsibly to develop a reasonable plan for repayment, \naccompanied by concomitant conduct, i.e., actions which evidence a serious intent to \ncarry out the plan. ISCR Case No. 15-02903 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017). Applicant has \na plan and has taken significant steps to execute it. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment. Applicant served honorably in the U.S. Army for many years, \nincluding a deployment to a combat zone. He continues to serve in the U.S. Army \nReserve. He has held a security clearance and SCI eligibility for many years, apparently \nwithout incident. He is working multiple jobs to generate sufficient income to fully resolve \nhis delinquent debts. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under \nGuideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information and \nSCI. Clearance is granted. \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges that, as of June 29, 2021, Applicant owed charged-off debts of $14,237 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), $12,495 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), $4,415 (SOR \u00b6 1.d), $4,301 (SOR \u00b6 1.e), and $10,534 (SOR \u00b6 1.f); and a collection debt of $8,423 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). When Applicant answered the SOR, he admitted five of the six alleged debts. He denied the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f on the basis that it has been paid. He provided a document from a collection entity showing that the debt had been settled on April 8, 2020, on receipt of a final resolution payment of $4,740. He explained that he was working through a debt-resolution company to address his delinquent accounts. (Item 1.) After considering Items 1 through 7, I make the following findings of fact: 3 Applicant is 66 years old and unmarried. He has no children. He has worked in the field of physical security since at least January 1991. He began working for his current employer, a defense contractor, in March 2019. As of July 2020, he was a guard site supervisor for the U.S. Army. (Item 7.) Applicant indicated on a March 21, 2020 Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) that he had been granted a security clearance at the secret level, although he did not know the date. (Item 2.) In response to the SOR, Applicant stated that he has been a security clearance holder since the early 1980s. (Item 1.) On his March 2020 SF 86, Applicant listed charged-off credit-card debts of $14,237 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), $16,796 (two accounts SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.e), $",

He submitted an undated response to \nthe SOR allegations and requested a decision on the written record in lieu of a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \nOn November 16, 2021, the Government submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM) \nconsisting of a statement of the Government\u2019s position and eight documents pre-marked \nas Item 1 through Item 7. The SOR and Applicant\u2019s SOR response were included as Item \n1. On November 17, 2021, DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant and \ninstructed him that any response was due within 30 days of receipt. Applicant received the \nFORM on November 26, 2021. The December 26, 2021 deadline for Applicant\u2019s response \npassed without any documents having been received from him in response to the FORM. \nOn February 2, 2022, the case was assigned to me to determine whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance \nfor Applicant. I received the case file and assignment on February 11, 2022. \nEvidentiary Rulings \nDepartment Counsel submitted as Item 7 in the FORM a summary report of a \npersonal subject interview (PSI) of Applicant conducted on July 8, 2020, by an authorized \ninvestigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The summary report of the \nPSI was included in a DOD report of investigation (ROI) in Applicant\u2019s case. Under \u00b6 \nE3.1.20 of the Directive, a DOD personal background ROI may be received in evidence \nand considered with an authenticating witness, provided it is otherwise admissible under \nthe Federal Rules of Evidence. The summary report did not bear the authentication \nrequired for admissibility under \u00b6 E3.1.20. \nIn ISCR Case No. 16-03126 decided on January 24, 2018, the DOHA Appeal Board \nheld that it was not error for an administrative judge to admit and consider a summary of a \nPSI where the applicant was placed on notice of his or her opportunity to object to \nconsideration of the summary; the applicant filed no objection to it; and there is no \nindication that the summary contained inaccurate information. In this case, Applicant was \nprovided a copy of the FORM and advised of his opportunity to submit objections or \nmaterial that he wanted the administrative judge to consider. In the FORM, Applicant\u2019s \nattention was directed to the following notice regarding Item 7: \nIMPORTANT NOTICE TO APPLICANT: The attached summary of your \nPersonal Subject Interview (PSI) is being provided to the Administrative \nJudge for consideration as part of the record evidence in this case.

Pro se \napplicants are not expected to act like lawyers, but they are expected to take timely and \nreasonable steps to protect their rights under the Directive. See ISCR Case No. 12-10810 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2016). See also ADP Case No. 17-03252 (App. Bd. Aug. 13, 2018) \n(holding that it was reasonable for the administrative judge to conclude that any objection \nhad been waived by an applicant\u2019s failure to object after being notified of the right to \nobject). \nApplicant was advised in \u00b6 E3.1.4 of the Directive that he may request a hearing. In \n\u00b6 E3.1.15, he was advised that he is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, \nor mitigate facts admitted by him or proven by Department Counsel and that he has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision. While the \nDirective does not specifically provide for a waiver of the authentication requirement, \nApplicant was placed on sufficient notice of his opportunity to object to the admissibility of \nthe interview summary report, to comment on the interview summary, and to make any \ncorrections, deletions, or updates to the information in the report. Applicant did not submit \na response to the FORM. \nGovernment officials are entitled to a presumption of regularity in the discharge of \ntheir official responsibilities. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-07539 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, 2018). \nApplicant can reasonably be held to have read the PSI summary in Item 7, and there is no \nevidence that he failed to understand his obligation to file any objections to the summary if \nhe did not want the administrative judge to consider it. Accordingly, I find that Applicant \nwaived any objections to the PSI summary. Items 1 through 7 are accepted as evidentiary \nexhibits subject to issues of relevance and materiality in light of the entire record. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges that, as of June 29, 2021, Applicant owed charged-off debts of \n$14,237 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), $12,495 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), $4,415 (SOR \u00b6 1.d), $4,301 (SOR \u00b6 1.e), and \n$10,534 (SOR \u00b6 1.f); and a collection debt of $8,423 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). When Applicant \nanswered the SOR, he admitted five of the six alleged debts. He denied the debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.f on the basis that it has been paid. He provided a document from a collection entity \nshowing that the debt had been settled on April 8, 2020, on receipt of a final resolution \npayment of $4,740. He explained that he was working through a debt-resolution company \nto address his delinquent accounts. (Item 1.)

Applicant indicated on a March 21, 2020 \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) that he had been granted a security \nclearance at the secret level, although he did not know the date. (Item 2.) In response to \nthe SOR, Applicant stated that he has been a security clearance holder since the early \n1980s. (Item 1.) \nOn his March 2020 SF 86, Applicant listed charged-off credit-card debts of $14,237 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a), $16,796 (two accounts SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.e), $8,423 (SOR \u00b6 1.c), and \n$10,534 (SOR \u00b6 1.f).

As of April 2020, the debt was listed on his credit report as a charge-off \nand as a collection balance. (Item 4.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f \u2014 $10,534 \nOn May 11, 2016, Applicant opened a credit-card account with a $10,670 credit \nlimit. The account was charged off for $10,534 on December 19, 2017. (Items 2, 3.) On \nApril 8, 2020, Applicant paid $4,740, which was accepted in full settlement of the debt. \n(Item 1.) \nWhen interviewed by an authorized investigator for the OPM on July 8, 2020, \nApplicant stated that he was contacted by an unknown person in 2016 and offered a \nbusiness opportunity. In return for an initial investment of cash in an amount he could not \nrecall, Applicant would receive a percentage from the company\u2019s sales. One month after \nhis initial investment, Applicant received $500, which was enough to persuade him that the \nbusiness opportunity was legitimate. Applicant invested a total of $16,000 on credit, even \nthough he did not receive another payment for his investments. He then stated that he \nreceived an unsolicited offer from another company, claiming that it could \u201cset up a false \ncompany for him\u201d through which the business expenses could be written off to clear the \ndebts. Applicant paid $14,000 into that venture. He denied any susceptibility to future \nscams as he had become weary of business ventures and knows that offers that sound too \ngood to be true probably are scams. Applicant stated that he had no paperwork or \nelectronic correspondence about the dealings. He did not report the scams to the police. \n(Item 7.) \nApplicant admitted that he owed the past-due debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e. He \nstopped paying on the accounts because the minimum monthly required payments \nbecame too high for him to pay them and also meet his living expenses. He paid a debt-\nresolution company $360 a month for about a year from 2018 to 2019 to address the \ndebts, but then began to suspect that he was being scammed. After learning from his \ncreditors that no efforts had been made to negotiate with them, he stopped paying the \ndebt-resolution firm. Aware of the charge offs, he had not contacted his creditors in over \nthree years. He expressed that he did not plan to pay the defaulted balances, but if \ncontacted, he would attempt to settle the debts for less than their full balances. (Item 7.) \nApplicant told the OPM investigator that his base annual income is $35,000, but with \novertime he can earn up to $60,000 a year. He estimated his monthly take-home income at \n$2,288 from which he pays his monthly expenses totaling $1,850. He did not maintain a \nsavings account but had about $17,482 in his checking account.

Applicant had continued to make \ntimely payments on his mortgage, which had a balance of $19,294. In September 2021, he \npaid off his car loan with his payment of $4,135. In June 2021, he paid off an unsecured \nloan obtained in September 2019. He had no open credit-card accounts. (Item 6.) \nIn response to the June 29, 2021 SOR, Applicant admitted that he had financial \ndifficulties largely because he \u201cwas taken advantage of by a debt relief agency.\u201d He \nexplained that he was contacted by the debt-resolution company, which promised to \nhandle everything with his creditors in return for monthly payments of $360. After he had \nmade several months of payments, he learned that his creditors had not been contacted. \nHe asserts that shortly after he stopped paying the first debt-resolution firm, he contacted \nanother debt-relief company, who instructed him to cancel his credit cards and stop paying \nthem. Applicant authorized the debt-relief company to handle his defaulted accounts. He \nprovided proof that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f had been settled, and stated that he was still \nworking with the debt-relief firm to settle his remaining delinquent debts. As evidence of his \nfinancial responsibility, Applicant cited the recent pay off of his vehicle loan \u201cwell in \nadvance of the loan terms.\u201d Additionally, he was making his monthly mortgage and utility \npayments on time and in full. (Item 1.) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nApplicant presented no details about his monthly payments to the second debt-relief \nfirm and no evidence showing progress toward resolving the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e, even \nthough he had an opportunity to update the evidentiary record in response to the FORM. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness\nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an\nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or\nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated\nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security\nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance\nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially\noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise\nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nGuideline F security concerns are established when an individual fails to pay \nfinancial obligations according to terms. Applicant defaulted on the six accounts listed in \nthe SOR, although he settled the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f for less than its full balance in April \n2020, well before the SOR was issued. While that debt is no longer a source of financial \npressure for Applicant, the federal government is still entitled to consider the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding his conduct in incurring and failing to satisfy the debt in a timely \nmanner. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-03991 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 1, 2015). The Appeal \nBoard has held that the administrative judge is not precluded from considering whether the \ncircumstances underlying a debt impugn an applicant\u2019s judgment or reliability. See, e.g., \nADP Case No. 14-022-6 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 15, 2015). An applicant\u2019s financial history and \ncircumstances are relevant in assessing his or her self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national interest as well as the vulnerabilities inherent in \nthe circumstances.  Applicant has yet to satisfy the majority of his delinquent debts, which \ntotal $43,871. Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca \nhistory of not meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply. \nThe Government had a legitimate case for application of AG \u00b6 19(b), \u201cunwillingness \nto satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so,\u201d as of July 2020. Applicant expressed \nduring his PSI that he had no plan to pay his charged-off debts, although he would attempt \nto negotiate settlements if contacted by his creditors. His settlement of the debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.f shows some willingness to pay his legitimate obligations, albeit on terms that appear to \nbe favorable to him. \nApplicant has the burdens of production and persuasion in establishing sufficient \nmitigation to overcome the financial concerns raised by his loan and credit-card defaults. \nOne or more of the following conditions under AG \u00b6 20 may apply in whole or in part: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) cannot reasonably apply in mitigation. Applicant has resolved only one \n(SOR \u00b6 1.f) of his established delinquent debts. An applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts \nevidence a continuing course of conduct and are considered recent. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 17-03146 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-08779 at 3 (App. Bd. \nNov. 3, 2017)). \nRegarding AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant maintains that his financial issues were caused, in \nlarge part, by the fact that he was taken advantage of by a debt-relief agency. A contractual \nviolation by the debt-relief company would be mitigating of his lack of progress toward \nresolving his debts from 2018 to 2019, when he was paying the company $360 a month to \ndeal with his creditors for him. It would not trigger AG \u00b6 20(b) with respect to his initial \ndefaults. Applicant took on a substantial amount of credit card debt in 2016 in what he \ndescribed as a \u201cbusiness investment.\u201d For his initial outlay of an unrecalled amount, he \nreceived $500, which apparently was enough to persuade him that it was a legitimate \nbusiness opportunity. He paid about $16,000 to the company, using his personal credit \ncards, despite seeing no additional return from his investments. His debts largely resulted \nfrom his questionable financial judgment and not because of a circumstance beyond his \ncontrol. The security concerns in that regard are further compounded if, as he stated, he \npaid a second, unsolicited company $14,000, to \u201cset up a false company for him\u201d through \nwhich the business expenses could be written off to clear the debt. AG \u00b6 20(b) has minimal \napplicability in this case. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) are established only with respect to the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f, \nwhich was settled for less than its full balance in April 2020. While Applicant explained in \nthe summer of 2021 that he is working through another debt-relief company to address his \nremaining delinquencies, his credit report of November 2021 showed no progress on those \naccounts. An applicant is not required to establish that he or she has paid off each debt in \nthe SOR, or even that the first debts paid be those in the SOR. See ISCR Case No. 07-\n06482 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). However, \u201can applicant must demonstrate a plan for debt \nrepayment, accompanied by concomitant conduct, that is, conduct that evidences a \nserious intent to resolve the debts.\u201d  See, e.g., ADP Case No. 17-00263 at 4. Applicant \nprovided no documentation of his agreement with the debt-relief firm or of any efforts the \ncompany may have made on his behalf. As recently as his PSI in July 2020, Applicant had \nabout $17,482 in his checking account and no plan to pay his charged-off balances. The \nfinancial considerations security concerns are not adequately mitigated. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Those factors are: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nThe analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some \nof the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment. \nThe security clearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed at collecting an \napplicant\u2019s personal debts. It is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness with regard to his fitness or suitability to handle classified \ninformation appropriately. See ISCR Case No. 09-92160 at 5 (App. Bd. June 21, 2010).\nApplicant is credited with paying his living expenses, including his mortgage, vehicle loan,\nand utilities on time. His November 2021 credit report shows that he made a lump-sum\npayment of $4,135 in September 2021 to pay off his vehicle loan ahead of time. Assuming\nthat he has a credible plan in place with the debt-relief firm to settle his outstanding\ndelinquencies, he showed a vulnerability to investment scams that raises serious doubts \nabout whether he can be counted on to exercise the judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness that must be expected from those persons granted access to classified \ninformation. It is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security\nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). Based on the\nevidence of record, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant\nor continue security clearance eligibility for Applicant. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nFor Applicant \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

Kent, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Eric Leckie, Esq. \n05/12/2022 \nDecision \nFOREMAN, LeRoy F., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guidelines G (Alcohol \nConsumption) and J (Criminal Conduct). Eligibility for access to classified information is \ngranted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application on October 26, 2020. On July \n21, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guidelines G and J. The CAF acted under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines (December 10, 2016). \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 14, 2021, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). \n1 \n\n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDepartment Counsel was ready to proceed on September 30, 2021. Scheduling of the \nhearing was delayed by travel and duty restrictions imposed in response to the COVID-\n10 pandemic. The case was assigned to me on March 8, 2022. After coordinating with \nApplicant\u2019s attorney, I scheduled the hearing to be conducted by video teleconference on \nApril 4, 2022. I convened the hearing as scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through \n6 were admitted in evidence without objection. Applicant testified and submitted \nApplicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through E, which were admitted without objection. I kept the \nrecord open until April 15, 2022, to enable him to submit additional evidence. He did not \nsubmit anything further. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on April 13, 2022. \nLegal Issues \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he asserted that the SOR was legally defective \nbecause it did not \u201cprovide the disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions for each \nadjudicative guideline cited,\u201d as required by DOD Manual 5200.02, paragraph 10.4.2. I \noverruled Applicant\u2019s objection to the SOR on the ground that DOD Manual 5200.02 is \nnot applicable to employees of defense contractors. I noted that Department Counsel\u2019s \nletter to Applicant dated March 30, 2021 (Hearing Exhibit I) and the letter transmitting the \nSOR to Applicant dated July 26, 2021 (Hearing Exhibit II) specifically advised Applicant \nof the allegations and the applicable adjudicative guidelines. \nIn Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR, he also submitted the equivalent of a motion \nin limine, objecting to the admission of court records that had been expunged in \naccordance with state law. Department Counsel responded by citing 5 U.S.C. \u00b6 9101, \nwhich requires all criminal agencies to provide records upon request by specified federal \nofficials. Department Counsel argued that state law does not bind the federal government. \nHe also pointed out that when Applicant submitted his SCA, he signed an authorization \nfor release of criminal records and that he voluntarily submitted the expunged records in \nhis answer to the SOR. I noted that the instructions for Section 22 of the SCA require \ndisclosure of information regardless of whether the record has been sealed, expunged, \nor otherwise stricken from the court record. I overruled the objection. \nAmendment of SOR \nAt Applicant\u2019s request and with the concurrence of Department Counsel, the first \nsentence of SOR \u00b6 1.d was amended to cite SOR subparagraph 1.c instead of \nsubparagraph 1.b. As amended, the first sentence of SOR 1.d alleges, \u201cYou received \nnon-judicial punishment for Article 92 failure to report/obey a lawful order for failing to \nimmediately report the arrest as set for in subparagraph 1.c.\u201d (Changed language in bold.) \n(Tr. 16.) \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.f \nand 2.a, and denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g-1.i and 2.b. His admissions are \nincorporated in my findings of fact. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant is a 25-year-old engineer hired by a defense contractor in October 2020, \ncontingent on his ability to obtain a security clearance. (Tr. 39.) He served on active duty \nin the U.S. Navy from December 2015 to November 2018 and received an honorable \ndischarge. He held a security clearance in the Navy. He has been a university student \nfrom January 2019 to the present, using his GI Bill educational benefits and seeking a \ndegree in electrical engineering. (Tr. 39-40.) He was married from March 2018 to October \n2020. He has no children. \nIn March 2016, Applicant received non-judicial punishment for underage alcohol \nconsumption. His punishment was restriction to the base for 45 days and forfeiture of \none-half of his pay per month for two months. He was required to attend a 20-hour alcohol \nand drug impact course, which he completed. (GX 2 at 11.). At the hearing, he testified \nthat this incident occurred after he had completed his engineering school, where he was \nthe top graduate, and he was celebrating with several classmates. After he and his \nclassmates returned to their barracks, they were unruly and rowdy. When questioned, \nApplicant\u2019s classmates identified him as one of the participants at the graduation \ncelebration. He was 19 years old at the time, and he was punished for underage drinking. \n(Tr. 25-27.) \nApplicant was arrested in September 2017 and charged with driving while \nintoxicated (DWI), first offense, and refusal of a blood or breath test. The blood or alcohol \ntest refusal was disposed of by nolle prosequi. (GX 6 at 1.) He was convicted of \nmisdemeanor DWI and appealed the conviction. In April 2019 he withdrew his appeal. He \nwas sentenced to 180 days in jail (suspended) and fines and costs of $546. His driver\u2019s \nlicense was suspended for one year and restricted to use for work and medical treatment, \nand he was required to install an ignition interlock device. (GX 6 at 3-6.) At the hearing, \nApplicant stated that he intends to apply for expungement of the court records of this \nincident. The petition for expungement submitted at the hearing showed no indicia that it \nhad been filed. (AX E.) I have taken judicial notice that the law of the jurisdiction where \nApplicant was charged limits expungement to cases where there was an acquittal, a nolle \nprosequi , or dismissal of the charge. (\u00a719.2-392.2.) \nIn April 2018, Applicant received non-judicial punishment for failure to report his \nSeptember 2017 arrest to his command. He was reduced from paygrade E-4 to paygrade \nE-3, restricted for 45 days, required to perform extra duty for 45 days, forfeited one-half \nof a month\u2019s pay for one month, and ordered to receive treatment in a substance abuse \nrehabilitation program (SARP). He received treatment and was diagnosed with Alcohol \nUse Disorder-Mild. Treatment at Level 1 was recommended. (GX 4 at 7.) He completed \nthe Level 1 treatment at a military medical facility in April 2018. (GX 2 at 9; GX 3.) The \nrecord reflects that he was briefed on the mandatory one-year aftercare program, but it \ndoes not reflect whether he completed it. (GX 2 at 10.) \nIn June 2018, Applicant was arrested and charged with public intoxication. He \ntestified that he and a group of friends were asked to leave a bar, but he returned to the \nbar to retrieve his cellphone, became involved in a discussion about his reason for \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nreturning to the bar, and was arrested. (Tr. 34-35.) He appeared in court with an attorney, \nand the charge was dismissed. (GX 2 at 14.) \nIn January 2020, Applicant was waiting for a rideshare service outside a bar, and \nhe became involved in a loud argument after someone made a derogatory comment \nabout his cousin, whose funeral was earlier in the day, and was charged with public \nintoxication. In February 2020, the charge of public intoxication was dismissed, and in \nJune 2020, the record was expunged. (AX B at 3-4.) \nIn March 2020, Applicant was arrested and charged with public intoxication after \nhe and an intoxicated family member were involved in an altercation. He completed \ntreatment through a SARP program in April 2020. In July 2020, the charge of public \nintoxication was dismissed, and in October 2020, the record was expunged. (AX B at 1-\n2.) \nAfter Applicant\u2019s non-judicial punishment in April 2018, he was required to attend \nAlcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings as part of his treatment. He continued to attend AA \nmeetings sporadically through 2019. During an interview with a security investigator in \nJanuary 2021, he stated that he was consuming four or five beers at a sitting once a \nmonth. (GX 2 at 15.) In response to DOHA interrogatories in May 2021, he stated that he \nwas consuming one to three beers once a week or every two weeks. (GX 2 at 6.) He \nresumed regular AA attendance in May 2021. (Tr. 32-33.) He testified that, after a \u201clot of \ntrial and error with responsible drinking,\u201d he stopped drinking alcohol in May 2021. At the \ntime of the hearing, he had stopped attending AA meetings. He testified that AA is very \nhelpful, but over time it becomes very depressing and its value is diminished. (Tr. 41.) He \nhas separated himself from his Navy friends, found new hobbies, and worked on physical \nfitness. (Tr. 28-29.) \nApplicant\u2019s former division officer aboard a Navy ship for two years considers him \nan honest, reliable, and inspiring sailor. (AX D at 5.) A chief petty officer who has known \nApplicant for about five years describes him as \u201ctirelessly hard working, trustworthy, \ncourteous, and honest.\u201d He believes that Applicant always achieves what he decides to \ndo \u201cwith dedication and sheer force of will.\u201d He is aware of the allegations in the SOR and \nbelieves that they will not be repeated. (AX D at 2.) A retired chief petty officer who was \nApplicant\u2019s leading petty officer believes that the conduct alleged in the SOR is not a true \nrepresentation of Applicant\u2019s character and that it will not recur. (AX D at 6.) A first class \npetty officer who has known Applicant for about three years states that Applicant had a \nreputation as one of the most hard-working and trustworthy sailors in the engineering \ndepartment of their ship. (AX D at 3). A former shipmate and personal friend considers \nApplicant honest, dependable, and trustworthy. (AX D at 4.) A fellow petty officer third \nclass states that Applicant was one of the hardest working, trustworthy, well-respected, \nand honest sailors in the command. (AX D at 1.) \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \n5 \n\n \n \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \u201cExcessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control \nimpulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \nfollowing disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol use or \nwhether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder; \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \nAG \u00b6 22(d): diagnosis by a duly qualified medical or mental health professional \n(e.g., physician, clinical psychologist, psychiatrist, or licensed clinical social \nworker) of alcohol use disorder. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable; \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or judgment; \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; and \nAG \u00b6 23(d): the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established pattern \nof modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with treatment \nrecommendations. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 23(a) is established. Applicant\u2019s alcohol-related incidents were not infrequent \nand they did not occur under unusual circumstances making recurrence unlikely, leaving \nonly the question whether \u201cso much time has passed.\u201d This prong of AG \u00b6 23(a) focuses \non whether the conduct was recent. There are no bright line rules for determining when \nconduct is recent. The determination must be based on a careful evaluation of the \nevidence. If the evidence shows a significant period of time has passed without any \nevidence of misconduct, then an administrative judge must determine whether that period \nof time demonstrates changed circumstances or conduct sufficient to warrant a finding of \nreform or rehabilitation. See ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). \nApplicant\u2019s last alcohol-related incident was more than two years ago, which is a \n\u201csignificant period of time.\u201d During that time, he has returned to college and is working \ntoward an engineering degree. He has found new hobbies and interests. He attended AA \nmeetings for a while but stopped because he believed that their value had diminished. He \nhas not consumed alcohol for one year, since May 2021. He has been offered a \nresponsible job with a defense contractor, contingent on receiving a security clearance. \nHe has convinced the state court that his two incidents of public intoxication should be \nexpunged. I am satisfied that his alcohol-related conduct is mitigated by the passage of \ntime. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 23(b) and 23(d) are established. Applicant has acknowledged his \nmaladaptive alcohol use, completed a SARP program, moderated his alcohol \nconsumption until May 2021, and thereafter has abstained from alcohol until the present. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.g-1.i are cross-alleged under this guideline. \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \u201cCriminal activity creates doubt \nabout a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into \nquestion a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations.\u201d \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nBoth mitigating conditions are established, for the reasons set out in the \nabove discussion of Guideline G. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines G and J in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered Applicant\u2019s \nmilitary service and the accolades he has received regarding his personal traits and the \nquality of his military service. He was sincere, remorseful, and credible at the hearing. His \nlast conviction was more than four years ago. His last arrest was more than two years \nago. He has abstained from alcohol for a year. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guidelines G and J, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns \nraised by his alcohol consumption and criminal conduct. \n8 \n\nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information. Clearance \nis granted. \nLeRoy F. Foreman \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

(Tr. at 7, 22-30; GE 1, 4) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had two delinquent student loans totaling $30,599 \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c), seven delinquent consumer debts totaling $30,448 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.e, \n1.h, 1.m, 1.o, 1xx, 1.yy), and 42 delinquent medical debts totaling $14,587 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, \n1.f, 1.g, 1.i - 1.l, 1.n, 1.p - 1.ww). The SOR allegations are established by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions in her Answer, in her October 2020 security clearance application (SCA), and \nin her January 2021 background interview; and by credit bureau reports from 2020 and \n2022.

The 2022 credit bureau report reflects that Applicant paid six medical debts totaling \n$3,120. (Answer; GE 1-4) \nApplicant attributed her delinquent debts to the following factors: (1) her period of \nunemployment from December 2016 to August 2017; (2) minimal income from August \n2017 to September 2020; (3) medical issues related to a condition for which she was \ndiagnosed in 2014, the birth of her eldest child in 2015, and medical expenses incurred \nduring her period of unemployment when she did not have medical insurance; (4) \npersonal issues, to include moving costs she incurred in 2021 when she left her children\u2019s \nfather; and (5) being a single mother of three children. She acknowledged that her \nfinancial mismanagement also contributed to her delinquent debts. (Tr. at 22-30, 50-55, \n60-61; GE 1, 4) \nApplicant earned approximately $45,000 annually from December 2014 to \nDecember 2016, before becoming unemployed. When she experienced medical issues \nrelated to the birth of her eldest child in November 2015, she took leave for approximately \nsix months. She received short-term disability insurance for one month and was unpaid \nfor five months.

She testified that since \nspeaking with a U.S. Department of Education (DOE) representative in approximately \n2020 about placing her student loans in deferment, she believed that her student loans \nwere deferred. She did not understand why they were reported as delinquent while they \nwere in deferment. She intended to set up a payment plan to repay her student loans. \nShe also testified that an unrecalled amount of her student loans were associated with a \ncollege that went out of business, and she was in the process of trying to obtain student \nloan forgiveness for the associated student loans since speaking with the DOE \nrepresentative in 2020.

These medical debts are \nassociated with routine medical appointments for Applicant\u2019s children. A February 2022 \naccount payment history from the collection agency reflects that Applicant made \npayments totaling $1,664 between August 2019 and February 2021, and her outstanding \nbalance was $680.

(Tr. at 51-52, 55, 58-62, 64; AE A, B) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . .. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant was unable to pay her debts. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c). \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control contributed to her financial problems. The\nfirst prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), she must provide \nevidence that she acted responsibly under her circumstances. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.xx and 1.yy are \nduplicates of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.b, respectively, and I find SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.xx and 1.yy in \nApplicant\u2019s favor. Applicant began paying her medical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.j, 1.l, 1.n, \n1.p through 1.s, 1.u through 1.z, 1.bb through 1.ee, 1.ii, and 1.kk through 1.oo in August \n2019, and she intended to continue to resolve them. I therefore find those SOR debts in \nApplicant\u2019s favor.  \n \nApplicant did not provide corroborating documentation of her efforts to resolve her \noutstanding student loans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1a and 1.c; her consumer debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.e, \n1.h, 1.m, and 1.o; and her remaining medical debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.g, 1.i, 1.k, 1.t, 1.aa, \n1.ff, 1.gg, 1.hh, 1.jj, 1.pp, 1.qq, 1.rr, 1.ss, 1.tt, 1.uu, 1.vv, and 1.ww. She has not \nestablished good-faith efforts to repay these debts. While she received financial \ncounseling in 2019, her finances are not under control, and her remaining financial issues \ncontinue to cast doubt on her judgment, trustworthiness, and reliability. I find that \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), \n20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) do not apply to these SOR debts. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \n7 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e - 1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.j: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.m: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.n: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.o: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.p - 1.s: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.t: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.u - 1.z: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.aa: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.bb - 1.ee: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.ff - 1.hh: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.ii: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.jj: \nAgainst Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.kk - 1.oo: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.pp - 1.ww: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.xx-1.yy: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

When \nApplicant was interviewed by a government investigator in December 2020, he confirmed \nthat he used marijuana four to six times in the previous seven years, and that most of the \nuse occurred by smoking it through a pipe, although he did consume an edible on one \noccasion. He used marijuana recreationally, at home, while he was relaxing, and his wife \nobtained it from a friend. He did not clarify which wife had obtained the marijuana. \n(Answer; GE 1 at 62-63; GE 2; Tr. 28-30) \nAt the hearing, Applicant testified that he used marijuana approximately two times \nin 2015, once with his first wife and once with a friend. He testified that his next use \noccurred over the holidays in 2019 with his second wife, and he attributed his use to \nanxiety and the stress of dealing with a blended family. Applicant also consumed an edible \nform of marijuana provided to him by his current wife in April 2020. He attributed his most \nrecent usage to stress and anxiety related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

He has continued to attend counseling sporadically for the past seven years \nand sought other avenues such as exercise, meditation, and social interactions to \naddress his stress and anxiety, but he continued to use marijuana occasionally until April \n2020.

In Applicant\u2019s state of residence, medicinal and recreational marijuana use is illegal. \nHe did not report his 2015 to 2020 marijuana use to his supervisor or FSO, but he knew \nhis use was inconsistent with holding a DOD security clearance. At the hearing, during \nhis interview, and in his 2020 SCA, Applicant stated that he does not intend to use \nmarijuana in the future.

He also provided evidence of his stable \nfinancial record and excellent performance record. (AE C-D; H-O; Tr. 18-22, 43-46) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted \nin this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant admitted he used marijuana four to six times between February 2015 \nand April 2020. He applied for and was granted a secret security clearance in \napproximately 2010. That he did not actually access classified materials during the time \nthat he used marijuana is irrelevant as to whether his behavior is disqualifying under the \nDirective. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence established the following \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); and  \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nThe burden shifted to Applicant to prove mitigation of the resulting security \nconcerns. AG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nAppellant\u2019s decision to use marijuana, an illegal drug, multiple times, while holding \na secret security clearance, cannot be considered a minor lapse in judgment, but rather\na pattern of behavior that reflects his unwillingness to follow rules and regulations.\nSecurity clearance decisions are not limited to conduct during duty hours. Off-duty\nconduct, especially where it reflects poor judgment, provides a rational basis for the \ngovernment to question an appellant\u2019s security worthiness. (See, e.g., Cole v. Young, 351\nU.S. 536, 550 n.13 (1956); Croft v. Department of Air Force, 40 M.S.P.R. 320, 321 n.1\n(1989)). Applicant\u2019s behavior showed a disregard for the law, regulations, and the \nfiduciary relationship he voluntarily entered into with the Government.  \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant used marijuana at least twice in 2015, once in 2019, and once in 2020. \nHe used marijuana with both of his wives and with a friend. The record shows that he did \nnot disclose his drug involvement to the Government until he completed an SCA in \nNovember 2020. He did not report his 2015 to 2020 marijuana involvement to his \nemployer or security officer. He acknowledged that his employer has a policy against \nillegal drug use, and he was subject to drug testing. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant credibly testified that he intends to no longer use marijuana; however, \nhe was in his mid-forties when he resumed his use of marijuana, and he sporadically used \nfor a five-year period with both of his wives. All of his drug involvement occurred while he \nwas working for his current employer, after he had completed a security clearance \napplication, and held a security clearance. Therefore, Applicant\u2019s assertions that he has \nstopped using illegal drugs were insufficient to overcome the concerns with respect to his \npast drug involvement. At this time, he did not demonstrate a lengthy enough pattern of \nabstinence, given the circumstances under which he chose to use marijuana. Applicant \nfailed to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and 26(b). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guidelines E and H in my \nwhole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s favorable character evidence, \nincluding his letters of recommendation. \nApplicant chose to use marijuana while working for his current employer and \nholding a secret security clearance. He used marijuana while he was in his mid-forties, \nduring both of his marriages, while he was a father, and when he was a manager at his \ncompany. There has not been a sufficient passage of time to overcome the concerns with \nhis drug involvement. I conclude Applicant has not met his burden of proof and \npersuasion. He did not mitigate the drug involvement or substance misuse security \nconcerns or establish his eligibility to maintain a security clearance. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of \nthe United States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to \nclassified information.

He abstained from illegal drugs for \napproximately six years. Then, from June 2015 to January 2021, Applicant consumed \nmarijuana edibles for recreational purposes and to help him relax and sleep. He used \nmarijuana about once every two months for a total of about five times over five and a \nhalf years. Applicant used marijuana at home while alone or with his cohabitant.

He \nclaimed that he never purchased marijuana or other illegal drugs, and that he no longer \nintends to use illegal drugs in the future.

He provided a December 2021 negative \ndrug test, a positive character reference from his cohabitant, and a signed statement of \nintent to abstain from all illegal drug and substance misuse.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued an October 25, 2014 \nmemorandum concerning adherence to federal laws prohibiting marijuana use. In doing \nso, the DNI emphasized three things. First, no state can authorize violations of federal \nlaw, including violations of the Controlled Substances Act, which identifies marijuana as \na Schedule I controlled drug. Second, changes to state law (and the laws of the District \nof Columbia) concerning marijuana use do not alter the national security adjudicative \nguidelines. And third, a person's disregard of federal law concerning the use, sale, or \nmanufacture of marijuana remains relevant when making eligibility decisions for \nsensitive national security positions. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position; and \n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the Government\u2019s exhibits established that from \n2015 to January 2021, Applicant purchased, possessed, and used marijuana while he \nheld a security clearance. The Government\u2019s exhibits also established that Applicant \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \ninitially expressed his intent to continue using marijuana, but then changed his mind. \nMarijuana is a controlled substance and is illegal under federal law. The above \ndisqualifying conditions are applicable. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; \nApplicant's illegal drug use about every two months from 2015 to 2021 was \nfrequent and occurred while Applicant was a mature adult. Throughout this period, \nApplicant held a security clearance. He knew that using marijuana was illegal and a \nsecurity concern as he was questioned about it and other illegal drug use during his \n2011 clearance process. While he last used an illegal drug in January 2021, this period \nof abstinence is significantly less than his period of use while holding a clearance. \nApplicant volunteered his marijuana involvement in his SF 86 and during his \nbackground interview. However, in both, despite being on notice that marijuana \ninvolvement is a security concern, he asserted that he planned to continue to use \nmarijuana. Applicant changed his position on future marijuana use only after receiving \nan SOR. I find that this timing undermines the veracity of his more recent assertion that \nhe will not use it in the future. Given the circumstances, Applicant has not abstained \nfrom illegal drug use for an appropriate period, and I am unable to conclude that illegal \ndrug use is unlikely to recur. AG \u00b6 26(a) is not established. \nWhile Applicant acknowledged his past drug involvement and substance misuse, \nfor the reasons provided in my analysis of AG \u00b6 26(a), he failed to establish a pattern of \nabstinence. He also failed to provide sufficient evidence of disassociation from drug-\nusing associates and contacts. Applicant stated in his subject interview that, at times, he \nwas with his cohabitant in his home while he used marijuana. It is unclear whether she \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \nused marijuana with him, and, if so, whether she continues to use. It is Applicant\u2019s \nburden to provide proof of mitigation. As he has not affirmatively proven whether his \ncohabitant used or continues to use marijuana, AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(b)(1) and 26(b)(2) are not \nestablished. AG \u00b6 26(b) is not established. \nNone of the mitigating conditions are applicable, and Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use \nis not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline H in my whole-person analysis. \nThe adjudicative guidelines give me the authority to grant conditional eligibility \n\u201cdespite the presence of issue information that can be partially but not completely \nmitigated, with the provision that additional security measures shall be required to \nmitigate the issue(s).\u201d I have not done so as I have concluded that it is not appropriate \nin this case for the aforementioned reasons. \nThe adjudicative guidelines also give me the authority to recommend approval of \na security clearance with a warning if I decide that the security concerns are not serious \nenough to warrant a recommendation of denial of eligibility. Pursuant to the analysis \nherein, I have not done so, as I found that the security concerns are serious enough to \ndeny eligibility. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

He started as a machinist helper/toolmaker apprentice. With no formal education, \nover the years, Applicant has worked himself up to a senior level quality engineering \nposition. In 2013, while employed for another defense contractor, Applicant applied for \na TS/SCI clearance through OPM. An SOR was issued to the Applicant, but it never \nwent to hearing because Applicant left the company before the matter was adjudicated, \nand his sponsorship stopped. (Tr. p. 59.)  \nIn August 2018, Applicant was terminated by his previous employer for excessive \ntardiness and absences as a result of his alcohol abuse which also affected his physical \nhealth. (Government Exhibit 1, page 35, and Tr. p. 59-62.) When Applicant lost his job, \nhe was unable to pay his bills, and they became delinquent. Applicant also lost his wife, \nand went through a difficult divorce. Applicant testified that even prior to losing his job, \nhis financial situation was \u201cvery tight\u201d and \u201cstressed.\u201d He explained that his financial \nsituation has been difficult for a long time. Applicant acknowledges that he was living \nbeyond his financial means for a long time. His family helped him and his ex-wife get \ninto an expensive house that they could not afford. His two vehicles were repossessed, \nand other bills became delinquent. \nApplicant\u2019s physical heath also suffered. The \nsnowball effect of these things caused a number of his debts to become delinquent. \nApplicant could not afford to pay for the cost of alcohol and drug treatment \nrehabilitation.  So, his father paid for the cost.

To cope with a difficult \nmarriage, Applicant stated that he \u201cself-medicated\u201d by drinking excessively. \nIn 2017, after ignoring intestinal and abdominal pain for several weeks, Applicant \nwas diagnosed with pancreatitis, and checked himself into a drug and alcohol \nrehabilitation program. This was Applicant\u2019s third time entering into and completing an \ninpatient treatment program for drug and alcohol recovery. Applicant completed a 28 \nday in-patient treatment program followed by an aftercare program which involved \ncontinued abstinence and structured meetings with psychologists, therapists, and a \ncommunity-based 12-step program. \nApplicant stated that he has been completely \nabstinent from alcohol since January 23, 2019.  (Tr. p. 41.) \nIn March 2019, Applicant began working for his current employer. He completed \na security clearance application dated June 4, 2020. After the SOR was issued in this \nmatter, Applicant started to address his financial issues by paying off some of his debts, \ntrying to settle others, and having others removed from his credit report. Applicant hired \na credit repair company and paid them $1,200 to assist in resolving his debts. (Tr. p. \n42.)  \nThe following delinquent debts listed in the SOR were delinquent: \n1.a.  A delinquent debt was charged off in the approximate amount of $19,982. After \nlosing his job, Applicant\u2019s car was repossessed and sold at auction. The deficiency \nbalance was owed. A recent settlement offer was reached in the amount of $915. \nInitially, Applicant agree to make three separate payments of $304.90, but then elected \nto pay off the entire debt in full, which he has recently done. The debt has been \nresolved. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits A and Q.) \n1.b. A delinquent debt was charged off in the approximate amount of $10,203. A \nsecond car was repossessed and sold at auction.  The deficiency balance was owed. A \nrecent settlement offer was reached in the amount of $4,100. Applicant is required to \nmake monthly payments of $227.78 until February 23, 2023. Applicant has made three \npayments under the agreement. He still owes about $3,419. Applicant plans to resolve \nthe debt within the next 18 months. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit B and Tr. pp. 44 and 50.) \n1.c. A delinquent debt was placed for collection in approximate amount of $3,563. \nApplicant was evicted for failing to pay his rent and breaking his lease. He owes back \nrent and associated fees. Applicant admitted that he left the apartment, and went into \nalcohol rehabilitation. After completing rehabilitation, he went back to work, and was \nadvised that the creditor had obtained a judgment against him and a writ of garnishment \nwas issued. The debt remains owing. Applicant plans to resolve the debt within the \nnext 18 months. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits C and D and Tr. pp. 49 and 50.) \n1.d. A delinquent debt was placed for collection in the approximate amount of $2,455. \nThis debt is related to the circumstances set forth in allegation 1.c.

He states that he \nfiled these income tax returns in June 2020, but the IRS did not acknowledge the filing \nuntil July 2021. Applicant recently learned that he owes the Federal government $925 \nin late tax filing penalties and interest. A payment on this debt is due December 21, \n2021. (Tr. p. 57.)  \nApplicant\u2019s history includes three separate stints at three reputable inpatient \ntreatment centers in the country. \nFrom June 2004 to September 2004, Applicant \ncompleted his first inpatient treatment program for alcohol and drug recovery. This was \na 90-day treatment program.  (Tr. p. 66.)  Applicant abstained from drinking alcohol for a \nperiod, before he returned to abusing alcohol. \nIn January 2009, Applicant attended a second 90-day treatment program for \nalcohol and drug recovery. \nThis was also an inpatient treatment program. \nAfter \ncompleting this program, Applicant was able to abstain from consuming alcohol for a \nperiod before he returned to consuming alcohol. \nApplicant testified that he has \nsporatically attended Alcoholics Anonymous over the years, until the last two and a half \nyears when he has taken it very seriously. His third inpatient treatment program, his \nmost recent one, was discussed earlier in this decision. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquencies related in part to his alcohol \nproblem. His large indebtedness and irresponsible conduct shows a history and pattern \nof poor judgment and an inability to meet his financial obligations. The evidence is \nsufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under Financial Considerations are potentially \napplicable under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent  or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce, or \nseparation, clear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity \ntheft), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue.  \nSince issuance of the SOR, Applicant has been working to resolve his delinquent \ndebts. He is commended for making some progress. However, Applicant still owes a \nsignificant amount of money in delinquent debt, in excess of $10,000. Furthermore, the \nlikelihood that he will become excessively delinquently indebted again is highly \nprobable. Applicant is a recovering alcohol who has not shown that he can beat his \ndisease. He was terminated from previous employment related to his drinking. His \ndivorce was related to his drinking. \nHe has undergone three separate inpatient \ntreatment programs because of his drinking. He still has delinquent debts because of \nhis drinking. \nEach time following inpatient alcohol treatment, Applicant had been sober for a \nperiod, and then returns to drinking. \nHis excessive drinking pattern has had a \ndetrimental impact on his finances. Until recently, Applicant has not been in control of \n7 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhis finances. Applicant\u2019s finances and his alcohol consumption seem to go hand and \nhand. When Applicant is drinking, his finances are in disarray. When he goes into \ntreatment, he stops drinking, and cleans up his credit. Applicant has been abstinent \nsince January 2019, over two years, and his finances have improved and are somewhat \nunder control.  However, a sustained history of financial responsibility is needed in order \nto meet the eligibility requirements for access to classified information. Applicant needs \nmore time to prove that he can be financially responsible. Accordingly, the financial \nconsideration security concern has not been mitigated. This guideline is found against \nApplicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant has been working on \nresolving his indebtedness. He currently owes in excess of $10,000 in delinquent debt, \nincluding what he owes to the IRS. \nApplicant has more work to do to show the \nGovernment that he can be consistently responsible with his financial affairs, in order to \nmeet the eligibility requirements for access to classified information. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has not \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concern. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a., and 1.b. \n \nSubparagraphs 1.c., and 1.d. \nSubparagraphs 1.e, through 1.n. \n For Applicant \n     Against Applicant \n  For Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national \nsecurity eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from approximately October 2003 to about May 2020 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), including after he was granted a DOD security clearance in July 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). (Item 1.) When he answered the SOR, Applicant admitted that he used marijuana in the past, but not while employed by the U.S. government.

The DCSA CAF explained in the SOR why it was unable to find it clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him. The \nDCSA CAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense \n(DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuidelines (AG) effective June 8, 2017, applicable to all adjudications for national security \neligibility or eligibility to hold a sensitive position. \nOn October 15, 2021, Applicant answered the SOR allegations and requested a \ndecision on the written record in lieu of a hearing before a Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) administrative judge. The Government submitted a File of Relevant \nMaterial (FORM) on December 17, 2021, consisting of a statement of its position and five \nexhibits pre-marked as Items, which included the SOR as Item 1 and the SOR response as \nItem 2. DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant on December 20, 2021, and \ninstructed him that any response was due within 30 days of receipt. Applicant received the \nFORM on January 15, 2022. No response was received by the February 14, 2022 \ndeadline. \nOn March 18, 2022, the case was assigned to me to determine whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance \nfor Applicant. I received the case file on March 28, 2022. \nEvidentiary Rulings \nDepartment Counsel submitted as Item 4 in the FORM a summary report of a \npersonal subject interview (PSI) of Applicant conducted on November 16, 2020, by an \nauthorized investigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The summary \nreport of the PSI was included in a DOD report of investigation (ROI) in Applicant\u2019s case. \nUnder \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the Directive, a DOD personal background ROI may be received in \nevidence and considered with an authenticating witness, provided it is otherwise admissible \nunder the Federal Rules of Evidence. The summary report did not bear the authentication \nrequired for admissibility under \u00b6 E3.1.20. \nIn ISCR Case No. 16-03126 decided on January 24, 2018, the DOHA Appeal Board \nheld that it was not error for an administrative judge to admit and consider a summary of a \nPSI where the applicant was placed on notice of his or her opportunity to object to \nconsideration of the summary; the applicant filed no objection to it; and there was no \nindication that the summary contained inaccurate information. In this case, Applicant was \nprovided a copy of the FORM and advised of his opportunity to submit objections or \nmaterial that he wanted the administrative judge to consider. In the FORM, Applicant\u2019s \nattention was directed to the following notice regarding Item 4: \nIMPORTANT NOTICE TO APPLICANT \nThe attached summary of your Personal Subject Interview (PSI) (Item 4) is \nbeing provided to the Administrative Judge for consideration as part of the \nrecord evidence in this case. In your response to this [FORM], you may \ncomment on whether the PSI summary accurately reflects the information \nyou provided to the authorized OPM investigator(s) and you may make any \ncorrections, additions, deletions, and updates necessary to make the \nsummary clear and accurate.

If no objections are raised \nin your response to the FORM, or if you do not respond to this FORM, \nthe Administrative Judge may determine that you have waived any \nobjections to the admissibility of the summary and may consider it as \nevidence in your case. \nConcerning whether Applicant understood the meaning of authentication or the legal \nconsequences of waiver, Applicant\u2019s pro se status does not confer any due process rights \nor protections beyond those afforded if he was represented by legal counsel. Pro se \napplicants are not expected to act like lawyers, but they are expected to take timely and \nreasonable steps to protect their rights under the Directive. See ISCR Case No. 12-10810 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2016). See also ADP Case No. 17-03252 (App. Bd. Aug. 13, 2018) \n(holding that it was reasonable for the administrative judge to conclude that any objection \nhad been waived by an applicant\u2019s failure to object after being notified of the right to \nobject). \nApplicant was advised in \u00b6 E3.1.4 of the Directive that he may request a hearing. In \n\u00b6 E3.1.15, he was advised that he is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, \nor mitigate facts admitted by him or proven by Department Counsel and that he has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision. While the \nDirective does not specifically provide for a waiver of the authentication requirement, \nApplicant was placed on sufficient notice of his opportunity to object to the admissibility of \nthe interview summary report, to comment on the interview summary, and to make any \ncorrections, deletions, or updates to the information in the report. Applicant did not submit \na response to the FORM. \nGovernment officials are entitled to a presumption of regularity in the discharge of \ntheir official responsibilities. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-07539 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, 2018). \nApplicant can reasonably be held to have read the PSI summary in Item 4, and there is no \nevidence that he failed to understand his obligation to file any objections to the summary if \nhe did not want the administrative judge to consider it. Accordingly, I find that Applicant \nwaived any objections to the PSI summary. Items 1 through 5 are accepted as evidentiary \nexhibits subject to issues of relevance and materiality in light of the entire record. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant used marijuana with varying \nfrequency from approximately October 2003 to about May 2020 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), including \nafter he was granted a DOD security clearance in July 2006 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). (Item 1.) When \nhe answered the SOR, Applicant admitted that he used marijuana in the past, but not while \nemployed by the U.S. government. After resigning from federal civilian service in July 2011 \nand moving abroad for his now ex-wife\u2019s education, he resumed using marijuana \n\u201csporadically.\u201d (Item 2.)

(Item 3.) \nIn October 2013, Applicant relocated to his present area. He worked part time in the \nrestaurant industry primarily. He also worked part-time for a tech shop from March 2015 to \nFebruary 2016, when he was laid off; and from July 2016 to June 2017, as a self-employed \nproduct engineer for a start-up company that went out of business.

In September \n2020, he accepted an offer of employment as an engineer and developer for a defense \ncontractor. The job is contingent on him obtaining a DOD secret clearance. (Item 3.) \nOn September 30, 2020, Applicant completed and certified as accurate a \nQuestionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86). He responded affirmatively to an SF \n86 inquiry concerning any illegal drug use in the last seven years and reported that he had \nused marijuana.

He affirmed \nhis SF 86 disclosure of having used marijuana from zero to three times per week; \ncharacterized his marijuana use as solely recreational; and related that it occurred in his \napartment with lots of friends, who brought the drug with them. He found marijuana to be \ncalming and relaxing.

He \nstated that he \u201cdid not use marijuana at all\u201d as a federal employee, but after resigning his \nposition in July 2011, he moved to country X for his now ex-wife\u2019s graduate education \n\u201c[w]here [he] imbibed a marijuana cigarette.\u201d In response to SOR \u00b6 1.b, Applicant stated \nthat he used marijuana sporadically after he resigned from his federal job: \nOutside of employment with the Federal Government and with no interaction \nwith any former government employees or government entities is when I \nagain used marijuana sporadically. But at NO time during my employment as \na Federal Government Employee was marijuana used. (Item 2.) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concerns about drug involvement and substance misuse are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe \nany of the behaviors listed above. \nIn addition to the above matters, I note that marijuana remains a Schedule I \ncontrolled substance under federal law pursuant to Title 21, Section 812 of the United \nStates Code. Schedule I drugs are those which have a high potential for abuse; have no \ncurrently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States; and lack accepted safety \nfor use of the drug under medical supervision. Section 844 under Title 21 of the United \nStates Code makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly or intentionally possess a \ncontrolled substance not obtained pursuant to a valid prescription. On October 25, 2014, \nthe then Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued guidance that changes to laws by \nsome states and the District of Columbia to legalize or decriminalize the recreational use of \nmarijuana do not alter existing federal law or the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand that an individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the use, sale, or manufacture \nof marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in national security determinations. \nApplicant has admitted that he used marijuana in college, starting around October \n2006. It is unclear whether he used any marijuana during the year following his college \ngraduation in May 2005. He abstained from marijuana for five years while a federal civilian \nemployee with a DOD secret clearance. After moving abroad with his now ex-wife in 2011, \nhe resumed using marijuana. He provided no details about the circumstances or the \nfrequency of his marijuana use in the foreign country. Similarly, apart from indicating that \nhe smoked marijuana with many friends in his apartment, he provided little specifics about \nhis use of marijuana after he returned to the United States in July 2013. He asserts a last \nuse in May 2020, and there is no evidence to the contrary. On his SF 86, he indicated a \nfrequency of marijuana use \u201c0 \u2013 3\u201d times a week.\u201d It may reasonably be found that there \nwere weeks when he used marijuana three times. His marijuana use (SOR \u00b6 1.a) is \npotentially disqualifying under AG \u00b6 25(a), \u201cany substance misuse.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 25(c), \u201cillegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of drug \nparaphernalia\u201d is triggered only in that he had physical possession of marijuana when he \nsmoked it. He stated during his PSI that his friends provided the marijuana that he used. \nThere is no evidence that he purchased marijuana. \nThe evidence does not establish AG \u00b6 25(f), \u201cany illegal drug use while granted \naccess to classified information or holding a sensitive position.\u201d Applicant has repeatedly \nasserted that he abstained from marijuana while he was working as a federal employee \nholding a secret clearance. Marijuana use during that time cannot be inferred. While \nApplicant gave dates for first and last marijuana use of October 2003 and May 2020, \nrespectively, it does not necessarily mean that he used marijuana throughout the entire \ntime. Applicant indicated during his PSI that there was a long period where he abstained \ncompletely, and that he did not use marijuana while holding a security clearance. The \nevidence is undisputed that Applicant relapsed into marijuana use after he left his federal \njob. However, he had no need for a security clearance in any subsequent employments \nbefore he applied for the position with the company currently sponsoring him for security \nclearance eligibility. SOR \u00b6 1.b is unsubstantiated in that it alleges that Applicant \n\u201ccontinued\u201d his use of marijuana after he was granted a DOD security clearance in July \n2006. \nApplicant bears the burden of establishing that matters in mitigation apply of his \nmarijuana use. AG \u00b6 26 provides for mitigation as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non an individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \nillegal drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging \nthat any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness during \nwhich these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including, \nbut not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without \nrecurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical \nprofessional. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) cannot reasonably apply in mitigation. When Applicant completed his \nSF 86, he indicated that he used marijuana \u201coccasionally\u201d for recreation or to reduce \nanxiety and help him sleep. During his PSI, Applicant reportedly stated that he could not be \nmore specific about the number of times that he used marijuana because it was different \neach week. In response to the SOR, he described his marijuana use as sporadic. While \nthere was no regular pattern to his marijuana use, and he abstained for some five years \nwhile working as a federal employee from 2006 to 2011, he stated that he used the drug \nwith too many friends to name during his PSI. It was certainly recurrent. Moreover, \nApplicant\u2019s use of marijuana in May 2020 was recent as of his September 2020 SF 86. \nRegarding AG \u00b6 26(b), Applicant indicated during his PSI that he no longer has any \ncommunications with the many friends with whom he used marijuana because he wants to \nfocus on his career. He denied any intention to use marijuana in the future. While the \ndisassociation from drug-using friends provides for some mitigation in AG \u00b6 26(b), it is \ntroubling that Applicant relapsed into using marijuana on occasion after he left his federal \nemployment. His abstention from the drug while holding a DOD clearance is indication that \nhe knew marijuana use was incompatible with his federal employment and clearance. \nApparently, the federal prohibition against marijuana was not a concern for Applicant until \nhe decided that it was in his best interest to abstain for his career. \nWhile there is no evidence of any marijuana use by Applicant in almost two years, \nthere is also a paucity of evidence of his current circumstances, activities, and \nassociations. Having chosen a decision on the written record, it was incumbent on \nApplicant to provide sufficient mitigation to overcome the security concerns raised by his \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nuse of marijuana for recreational purposes, but also to relax and help him sleep. His \nresponse to the SOR, where he admitted to sporadic use of marijuana, is difficult to \nreconcile with his PSI account of having used marijuana with friends too numerous to list \nduring his PSI. Applicant has been in a cohabitant relationship since October 2018. It is \nunclear whether he used marijuana with his girlfriend. The risk of recurrence cannot be \ncompletely ruled out, given the limited evidence about the extent and circumstances of his \nmarijuana use. The drug involvement and substance misuse security concerns are not fully \nmitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept  \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nThe Government must be assured that those persons granted access to classified \ninformation can be counted on to fulfill their responsibilities consistent with laws, \nregulations, and policies, including federal drug laws and security clearance requirements. \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use was not confined to college. After his marriage broke up, he \nmade a new life for himself in his current area. That life included socialization with many \nfriends who supplied him with marijuana. He was in his 30s, so his marijuana use cannot \nbe excused as youthful indiscretion. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th  Cir. 1990). For the reasons \npreviously discussed, doubts persist as to whether it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________ \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant eligibility for a security clearance for Applicant.

He has worked for \nhis current employer since December 2019. He attended a trade school from 2010 until \n2011 and earned a trade certificate. He has never been married and has no children. \n(Tr. 21; GE 1, 2) \nIn about August 2006, Applicant was charged with driving under the influence of \nalcohol (DUI) in State A. He had been drinking mixed drinks at a party and was \nimpaired. He claimed that he gave his keys to another individual in order to drive him \nhome, but that person was also impaired. Whoever was driving Applicant\u2019s car hit a \ntelephone pole and police arrived on the scene. Applicant claimed that the driver fled \nthe scene and he was in the passenger seat. He told police he had not been driving. He \nclaimed that, despite the fact that he had not been driving, police arrested him for DUI \nbecause his car had been involved in the accident and he had a blood alcohol content \n(BAC) over the legal limit. He was convicted of DUI. Based upon the self-serving nature \nof his story and his arrest and conviction, I find Applicant\u2019s claim that he was not driving \nhis car strains credulity. He was driving under the influence of alcohol during this \nincident. His driver\u2019s license was suspended for nine months and he was placed on \nprobation. He was also required to attend court-ordered alcohol-related classes and he \nhad to pay $1,600 in fines. He claimed that he has satisfied all the requirements of this \nDUI conviction. He went to Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings for about a year after \nthis arrest. However, he drank alcohol during the time period he was attending these \nmeetings. (Tr. 18, 23, 25, 33, 37-38, 52; Answer; GE 1-3) \nIn about July 2010, Applicant was charged with DUI in State A. He was pulled \nover after driving home from a concert where he had been drinking beer. He claimed \nthat he had only had four beers over a five-hour period. He was given a breathalyzer \ntest, resulting in a .08 BAC. He was arrested and spent the night in jail. He pleaded \nguilty and was convicted of DUI. As a result of his conviction, he was fined and ordered \nto take 18 months of weekly DUI instructional classes. He attended these classes until \nabout 2011, but transportation issues and scheduling conflicts resulted in his failing to \ncomplete the courses. He was also ordered to install an ignition interlock device on his \nvehicle, which he failed to do. Applicant lost his job as a driver as a result of this DUI. As \nof the date of the hearing, he still had not complied with the terms of his sentence as he \nhas yet to complete the DUI instructional courses or install an ignition interlock system \non his car. He claimed that he has not completed these requirements because of the \ntime and money it would cost him. He also acknowledged missing these classes \nbecause he was being foolish.

He obtained a valid \ndriver\u2019s license in State C through their application process that involved a \u201cTermination \nAction\u201d of his State A driver\u2019s license suspension. Despite arguably not being eligible for \nthe Termination Action in State A pursuant to the language in its own forms (ineligible if \nindividual has not complied with an ignition interlock requirement), Applicant was \ngranted his request for a Termination Action in State A and obtained a driver\u2019s license in \nState C. He is not permitted to drive in State A because he has not complied with (at \nleast) the ignition interlock portion of his 2010 DUI conviction. He claimed that he has \nnot driven on a suspended license after his 2018 charge in State B. He also claimed \nthat he has not consumed alcohol and driven after his 2010 DUI arrest. (Tr. 44-51; \nAnswer; AE A) \nApplicant claimed that he has steadily cut back on his drinking after his 2010 DUI \narrest and conviction. He was drinking about a six-pack of beer every day prior to his \n2010 DUI. In 2020, he claimed that he was drinking a 12-pack of beer two weekends \nper month. During the hearing, he testified that, after he obtained his driver\u2019s license in \nState C in 2020, he only drinks one or two beers at a sitting. However, he also testified \nthat he drank four beers at a sitting about three weeks before the hearing. He claimed \nthat he no longer drinks to the point of intoxication. However, he testified that he was \nlast intoxicated in December 2021 after drinking 11 beers at one sitting while visiting his \nfamily in State A. He acknowledged that, at some point in the past, he had a problem \nwith alcohol and considered himself to be an alcoholic, but he has never been \ndiagnosed by a qualified professional as having an alcohol use disorder. He claimed \nthat he has never tried to abstain from alcohol completely, but may when he is married \nand has children. (Tr. 23-28, 52-56) \nApplicant provided a character-reference letter from his facility security officer \n(FSO) praising Applicant for his honesty, hard work, and responsibility. His FSO claimed \nthat he believed that Applicant has learned from his mistakes and should be entrusted \nwith a security clearance.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n(g) failure to follow any court order regarding alcohol education, \nevaluation, treatment, or abstinence.   \nApplicant was charged with and convicted of DUI in 2006 and 2010. Applicant \nfailed to comply with his court-ordered alcohol education classes from his 2010 DUI \nconviction. These facts render the foregoing disqualifying conditions applicable and shift \nthe burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment;  and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations.   \nApplicant has not been charged with an alcohol-related offense in 12 years. \nThere is no evidence that he has driven a vehicle while impaired during this time. He \nunderstood that he had a problem with alcohol and modified his consumption by \ngradually drinking less and less often over the years. He went from drinking a six-pack \nevery day to only drinking a few beers per month. Based on these considerations, I find \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nthat AG \u00b6 23(a) and AG \u00b6 23(b) are applicable. Applicant has mitigated the alcohol \nconsumption security concerns. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; \nand \n(c) violation or revocation of parole or probation, or failure to complete a \ncourt-mandated rehabilitation program. \nApplicant engaged in criminal behavior in 2006 and 2010 by driving while \nimpaired by alcohol. He also engaged in criminal behavior by driving while his driver\u2019s \nlicense was suspended from 2011-2018. He failed to comply with the requirements of \nhis 2010 DUI conviction by not attending court-mandated classes and not installing an \nignition-interlock device on his car. These facts render the foregoing disqualifying \nconditions applicable and shift the burden to Applicant to mitigate those concerns. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has not been charged with a crime after 2018. However, as he has not \ntaken the required alcohol-related classes or installed an ignition interlock system on his \ncar, he still has not complied with the sentencing requirements of his 2010 DUI \nconviction. This continued lack of compliance precludes him from mitigating his criminal \nbehavior through the passage of time without recurrence or by showing successful \nrehabilitation. \nHis \ncontinued \nnon-compliance \ncasts \ndoubt \non \nhis \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines G and J in my whole-person analysis. I have also \nconsidered Applicant\u2019s positive character reference. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant \nmitigated the alcohol consumption security concerns, but did not mitigate the criminal \nconduct security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraph 2.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.c:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

Scheduling of the hearing was delayed by COVID-19 \nhealth precautions. The case was assigned to me on February 15, 2022. On March 28, \n2022, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the \nhearing was scheduled to be conducted by video teleconference on April 6, 2022. On \nApril 4, 2022, Applicant\u2019s attorney entered an appearance and requested that the hearing \nbe postponed for two months. I granted the request. \nOn March 28, 2022, DOHA notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled to \nbe conducted by video teleconference on June 21, 2022. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through H, which \nwere admitted without objection. I kept the record open until July 21, 2022, to enable \nApplicant to submit additional evidence. He timely submitted AX I through N. AX N \nconsisted of two MP4 film clips that could not be printed, but the parties agreed on a \nnarrative description of the content of the film clips. (HX II.) DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript (Tr.) on June 30, 2022. The record closed on July 21, 2022. \nAmendment of SOR \nAt the hearing, Department Counsel moved to amend the SOR as follows: \nAmend SOR \u00b6 1.c by replacing the words \u201cprior to March 2019\u201d with the words, \u201cin \nMarch 2019.\u201d \nAmend SOR \u00b6 1.d by replacing the words \u201cyour son\u201d with the words, \u201cyour wife\u2019s \nson.\u201d \nAmend SOR \u00b6 2.b by replacing \u201cCaptain\u2019s Mask\u201d with Captain\u2019s Mast,\u201d and \nreplacing \u201cunder Other Than Honorable Conditions\u201d with \u201cwith a general discharge under \nhonorable conditions.\u201d \nAdd SOR \u00b6 1.h alleging as follows: \u201cIn January 2021, you were arrested and \ncharged with assault and battery, and a show cause order was issued against you for a \nprotective order violation.\u201d \nAdd SOR \u00b6 1.i alleging as follows: \u201cIn September 2020, you were charged with \nviolation of a protective order.

(HX III.) \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations under Guidelines \nJ and D, with exculpatory explanations. He did not expressly admit or deny the Guideline \nE allegations, which cross-allege the allegations under Guidelines J and D. His limited \nadmissions are incorporated in my findings of fact and discussed in more detail below. \nApplicant is a 39-year-old business systems analyst employed by defense \ncontractors since December 2017. He was terminated by another defense contractor in \nMay 2019 for using a government computer for personal email and was briefly \nunemployed. (Tr. 111-12.) He worked for other defense contractors from June 2019 until \nhe was hired by his current employer in April 2020. He received a security clearance in \nAugust 2019. (Tr. 120-21.) \nApplicant was born in a foreign country. He immigrated to the United States with \nhis mother and two sisters in 1991, and his father stayed behind in their native country. \nApplicant became a U.S. citizen in 2014. (Tr. 22.) He graduated from high school in 2001, \nattended college for one semester, and then enlisted in the U.S. Navy. (Tr. 23-24.) He \nserved on active duty in the Navy from January 2002 to December 2017 and received a \ngeneral discharge under honorable conditions. While on active duty, he received the Navy \nand Marine Corps Achievement Medal five times, the Good Conduct Medal three times, \nand multiple service ribbons and qualification badges. (AX E.) He received a security \nclearance in about 2012. (Tr. 30.) He has a 90% disability for multiple stress injuries to \nhis limbs, feet, and back, as well as depression and anxiety. (Tr. 34-35.) \nApplicant married in February 2015, separated in December 2018, and divorced \nin March 2020. He has a 16-year-old daughter from a previous relationship and two \nchildren with his ex-wife, ages eight and six. (Tr. 26.) \nIn 2008, Applicant was charged with felony kidnapping and assault. In his answer \nto the SOR, he admitted he was charged, but he denied that he was guilty. He testified \nthat he was in a relationship with an older woman and the relationship became toxic when \nshe started having conversations with an ex-boyfriend. During an argument, he attempted \nto leave their residence, but she blocked the door. She hit him, scratched him, and spat \nat him. He grabbed her by both arms and pinned her down on the bed. After he released \nher and started to leave, she called the police. Applicant waited in his car for the police to \narrive, believing that she would be arrested. (Tr. 55-59.) Court records reflect that he was \nfound not guilty of felony kidnapping. Disposition was deferred on the assault charge, \nconditioned on him having no contact with the woman for one year. After a year had \npassed, the assault charge was dismissed. (GX 4 at 1-2.) \nIn 2010, Applicant was charged with destruction of property. In his answer to the \nSOR, he stated that his cohabitant was upset about his long working hours and she \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nchanged the lock on the door of their residence while he was at work. He came home \nfrom work at about 3:00 or 4:00 a.m. and found that his cohabitant had changed the door \nlock. He called the police and showed the police officer a bank statement reflecting that \nhe lived there. According to Applicant, the police officer advised him that he was entitled \nto break in and recover his belongings but that he might be responsible for repairing the \ndoor. He broke in, retrieved some clothing and personal affects, put them in his car, and \nleft. (Tr. 61-64.) He was charged with intentional damage to property. He was convicted \nand sentenced to 30 days in jail (suspended) and unsupervised probation. He was \nrequired to pay restitution to repair the door. (GX 4 at 2.) In his answer to the SOR and at \nthe hearing, he stated that the judge told him to take his legal advice from an attorney \nand not from a police officer. (Tr. 65.) \nIn 2012, Applicant, then a petty officer first class, was accused of sodomizing a \nfemale shipmate, a petty officer second class, without her consent. He admitted having \nanal intercourse with the female sailor, but he maintained that it was consensual. The \nfemale sailor recanted her initial complaint and stated that they initially engaged in \nconsensual anal intercourse, but that she changed her mind and tried to move away but \ndid not tell Applicant to stop. Investigators concluded that the female sailor\u2019s accusation \nwas unfounded. Applicant\u2019s commander imposed nonjudicial punishment on both parties \nfor violating an order prohibiting sexual activity between sailors on the ship. Applicant\u2019s \npunishment was a reduction from petty officer first class to petty officer second class, \nrestriction for 45 days, 45 days of extra duty, and forfeiture of one half of his pay per \nmonth for two months. The female sailor\u2019s punishment was forfeiture of one half of her \npay for two months, and her recommendation for advancement was withdrawn. (GX 2 at \n1-2.) \nAt some time not reflected in the record, Applicant was promoted back to petty \nofficer first class. In July 2016, while Applicant was still married, he was accused by a \nfemale sailor, a petty officer second class, of sexual harassment by \u201cplay fighting\u201d with \nher, placing his hands around her neck and shaking her, and putting his hand on her thigh \nwhile they were riding in a military vehicle. Applicant testified that he and the female sailor \nworked together and became friendly. According to Applicant, their friendship became \nflirtatious and \u201csemi-sexual,\u201d to the point where she sent him \u201cracy\u201d photos of herself. He \ndenied asking the female sailor to have sex with him. (Tr. 36-40.) He believes that the \nfemale sailor made a report of sexual harassment in order to obtain a reassignment. (Tr. \n42.) However, he admitted at the hearing that, even if there had been no sexual \nharassment, his relationship with the female sailor was inappropriate. (Tr. 46.) In April \n2017, he received nonjudicial punishment for sexual harassment. He was reduced from \npetty officer first class to petty officer second class and processed for administrative \nseparation. (GX 2 at 3-4.) In December 2017, he received a general discharge under \nhonorable conditions. (AX E.) \nApplicant and his wife separated in December 2018 and divorced in March 2020. \nApplicant testified that after the divorce, his ex-wife would taunt him by calling him while \nshe was having sex with her boyfriend, sending him photos of her and her boyfriend \nhaving sex, and threatening him with violence. She told their son that he would never see \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhis father again because she intended to make sure that he would go to jail. (Tr. 70-71.) \nApplicant\u2019s divorce attorney described his ex-wife as \u201cone of the most spiteful, vindictive \nand caustic personalities I\u2019ve come across in 19 years of representing clients in family \nlaw issues.\u201d (AX I.) \nAfter Applicant and his wife separated, she moved out of the family home, but she \nleft clothing and other possessions in the home. In early March 2019, after repeatedly \nasking her to remove her belongings, Applicant decided to come up with the most \nhyperbolic statement he could think of to get her attention, and he told his wife that he \nwould burn her possessions if she did not remove them from the home. (Tr. 72.) She \nresponded to the threat by obtaining a protective order on March 7, 2019, with an \nexpiration date of March 11, 2019. (GX 3 at 7-8.) \nOn March 10, 2019, Applicant\u2019s wife accused Applicant of threatening to kill her \nsister and injure her son, and Applicant was charged with violating the protective order \nand using profane and threatening language. (GX 3 at 9.) Applicant denied making threats \nor using profane and threatening language. (Tr. 80.) He testified that when his son was \nthree or four years old, he was afraid of many things, and Applicant encouraged him to \nconfront his fear. Applicant testified that he would ask his son, \u201cWhy are you scared of \nthis? You want daddy to beat it up?\u201d During a video telephone call, his son said that he \nwas afraid of \u201cauntie\u201d and his mother\u2019s older son\u2019 Appellant\u2019s wife heard the conversation \nand interpreted it to mean that Applicant offered to beat up \u201cauntie\u201d and her son. (Tr. 81-\n82.)  \nApplicant\u2019s wife obtained another protective order on May 1, 2019, prohibiting \n\u201chostile contact\u201d with his wife and prohibiting all contact with her son. On May 10, \nApplicant was charged with violating the order. (GX 3 at 10.) The record does not reflect \nthe factual basis for this charge. On May 30, 2019, the charge was dismissed due to \ninsufficient evidence. (GX 3 at 3, 11.) The protective order violation was nolle prosequi \non May 30, 2019. (GX 4 at 2; AX I at 1.) \nAnother show cause order was issued against Applicant in August 2019 for \nviolating protective orders. The evidentiary basis for this order appears to have been \nApplicant\u2019s unwelcome visits and messages regarding visitation with his son. When \nApplicant learned that he was charged with violating protective orders, he turned himself \nin. (Tr. 77-78.) In November 2019, his wife\u2019s attorney requested that the show cause order \nbe removed from the hearing docket because the parties had resolved the matter. (AX F; \nTr. 157.) The show cause order was dismissed in on November 19, 2019. (GX 3 at 15.) \nApplicant and his ex-wife now communicate solely by email. (Tr. 97.) \nIn his post-hearing submission, Applicant submitted screen shots of Facebook \npages and film clips showing his ex-wife\u2019s boyfriend belittling him, threatening him, and \nharassing him when he met with his ex-wife to pick up his son for visitation. (AX L, M, and \nN.) In September 2020, the boyfriend accused Applicant of assaulting him. Applicant \ntestified that he was in front of a police station waiting to pick up his son from his ex-wife, \nwhen the boyfriend began directing abusive language toward him and attempted to block \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nhim for leaving his car. Applicant had agreed to pick up his son for visitation in front of the \npolice station instead of the daycare center because his ex-wife had suggested it. (Tr. \n162.) Applicant was able to get past the boyfriend, and he went into the police station and \nfiled a complaint against the boyfriend. The police reviewed the camera footage from the \nfront of the police station and charged the boyfriend with assault. The boyfriend then \naccused Applicant of assault. On March 10, 2021, both parties agreed to withdraw their \ncomplaints, and the charge against Applicant was dismissed. (AX H; Tr. 91-95.) \nWhen Applicant filed his complaint against his ex-wife\u2019s boyfriend, he discovered \nthat his ex-wife had filed a complaint in another jurisdiction, alleging violation of the May \n2019 order prohibiting \u201chostile contact.\u201d At the hearing, Applicant admitted violating the \norder when he responded to hostile emails and messages by calling her \u201ca lot of choice \nwords.\u201d He was charged with using profane and threatening language. The trial was \ndelayed by COVID-19. In September 2021, he pleaded \u201cno contest\u201d and was sentenced \nto one day in jail. (Tr. 88-89.) \nApplicant sought and received therapy from about June 2019 to January 2020. He \ntestified that he realizes that he was bitter because he wanted to keep the family together \nbut his ex-wife refused to do her part. (Tr. 155.) He now attends church regularly and has \na good relationship with his pastor. (Tr. 99.) He also has increased his contact with his \nparents, nieces, nephews, and sister for guidance and support. He has established \ncontact with his father, who remained in Applicant\u2019s country of birth, and has received \nhelpful guidance about dealing with his personal problems. (Tr. 98-103.) He testified that \nhe has learned that his ex-wife \u201cknows exactly how to push my buttons.\u201d (Tr. 184.) In his \ngroup therapy sessions, he has learned from people having similar issues and hearing \nhow they deal with them. He knows that if he gets upset, he has enough support from his \nfamily, his church, and his therapists to help him deal with it. (Tr. 188.) \nA former shipmate who has known Applicant for more than 17 years respects him \nas a former mentor and a trustworthy friend. (AX D at 4.) Applicant\u2019s immediate supervisor \nfor the past four years describes him as energetic, hard-working, reliable, honest, mature, \nand patient. (AX D at 1.) Another supervisor, a retired Navy commander, describes him \nas thoughtful, kind, poised, reliable, and mature. (AX D at 2.)

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations.\u201d \nThe evidence is not sufficient to establish the kidnapping alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, but \nit is sufficient to establish the assault. It is sufficient to establish the destruction of property \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b and to establish that Applicant threatened to burn his wife\u2019s property \nas alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c. It is sufficient to establish that the protective orders alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 1.i and the show cause order alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f were issued, \neven if some of them were unwarranted. It is sufficient to establish the arrest for assault \nand battery and the show cause order alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h and the violation of a show \ncause order alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.i. Finally, it is sufficient to establish that the sexual \nbehavior cross-alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g occurred. \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are established by the \nevidence: \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \nAG \u00b6 32(c): no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed \nthe offense; and \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 32(a) is established for the conduct in 2008 and 2010, which was the product \nof dysfunctional relationships with women with whom he terminated contact. It is \nestablished for the two Navy incidents in 2012 and 2017, which both involved violations \nof military orders and which, as such, are unlikely to recur. It is not established for the \nvarious protective orders and show cause orders. Although Applicant\u2019s marriage has \nbeen terminated, the potential for continued discord over the custody of Applicant\u2019s son \nremains.  \nAG \u00b6 32(c) is established for the charge of felony kidnapping in 2008 and the \nalleged threats that were the basis for violation of a protective order in 2019. It is not \nestablished for the other criminal conduct alleged in the SOR. \nAG \u00b6 32(d) is established. Applicant is apparently well-regarded at work. His \nturbulent marriage has ended, and more than three years have passed since the last \nencounter between him and his ex-wife. He has sought and received counseling, and he \nhas gained a better understanding of how to deal with situations where his ex-wife \n\u201cpushes the right button.\u201d \nGuideline D, Sexual Behavior \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG 12: \nSexual behavior that involves a criminal offense; reflects a lack of judgment \nor discretion; or may subject the individual to undue influence of coercion, \nexploitation, or duress. These issues, together or individually, may raise \nquestions about an individual's judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 13(a): sexual behavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the \nindividual has been prosecuted; \nAG \u00b6 13(c): sexual behavior that causes an individual to be vulnerable to \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and \nAG \u00b6 13(d): sexual behavior of a public nature or that reflects lack of \ndiscretion or judgment. \nAG \u00b6 13(a) is established. Although Applicant was not punished for sexual \noffenses under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), his sexual conduct on both \noccasions violated an order prohibiting sexual activity between sailors aboard the ship. \nHis disobedience violated Article 92, UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 892, a criminal statute. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 13(c) is established. In each of the two sexual incidents, Applicant was a \npetty officer first class in a supervisory position, and his sexual partner was a sailor junior \nto him, leaving him vulnerable to exploitation by threats to disclose his conduct. \nAG \u00b6 13(d) is established. Applicant\u2019s conduct was not public, but it reflected a \nlack of judgment. \nThe following mitigating conditions are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 14(b): the sexual behavior happened so long ago, so infrequently, or \nunder such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 14(c): the behavior no longer serves as a basis for coercion, \nexploitation, or duress; and \nAG \u00b6 14(d): the sexual behavior is strictly private, consensual, and discreet. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 14(b) and 14(c) are established. The most recent security-significant sexual \nbehavior was five years ago and no longer serves as a basis for exploitation because \nApplicant is no longer in the Navy. \nAG \u00b6 14(d) is not established. While Applicant\u2019s sexual activity may have been \nprivate, the 2017 conduct was not consensual, and neither instance of sexual behavior \nwas discreet. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \u201cConduct involving \nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules \nand regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. . . .\u201d \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress \n10 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nby a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes . . . engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nAG \u00b6 16(c) is established. Applicant has a long history of dysfunctional and \nsometimes violent relationships with women, resulting in a multitude of minor offenses \nreflecting bad judgment and lack of self-control. \nAG \u00b6 16(e) is established. Applicant\u2019s sexual behavior while in the Navy affected \nhis personal and professional standing, resulting in reductions in rate and the eventual \npremature termination of his military service. His history of domestic violence and multiple \nviolations of protective orders could affect his professional and community standing in \nthe civilian community. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate \nthe stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \nAG \u00b6 17(f): the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of \nquestionable reliability. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) is established. Most of the domestic incidents involved minor \nmisconduct, such as profanity and name-calling. The last incident resulting in a show \ncause order was in August 2019, more than three years ago. \nAG \u00b6 17(d) is established. Applicant has acknowledged that he overreacted to his \nex-wife\u2019s taunting. He sought and received counseling, and he gained insight into the \nreasons for his earlier behavior. He has a reputation among his colleagues at work for \nbeing thoughtful, reliable, patient, and mature. \nAG \u00b6 17(f) is established for the allegation of kidnapping alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a, the \nalleged threats alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d, and the assault alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h. It is not \nestablished for the other allegations in the SOR. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines J, D, and E in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, \nbut some warrant additional comment. Applicant was candid, sincere, and credible at the \nhearing. It is clear that he was involved in a series of dysfunctional relationships that were \nthe causes of the conduct alleged in the SOR. It is also clear that he was the victim of \nrepeated harassment by his vindictive ex-wife and her boyfriend. His toxic marriage is \nover, and he and his ex-wife have minimized their contact. He accepted responsibility for \nthe last domestic incident in August 2019 that was eventually adjudicated in September \n2021. He has obtained counseling and understands how he should have reacted to his \nwife\u2019s behavior. He now enjoys a reputation as a thoughtful, reliable, mature, and patient \nadult. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines J, D, \nand E, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude \nApplicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his criminal conduct, sexual \nbehavior, and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.i: \nFor Applicant \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nParagraph 2, Guideline D (Sexual Behavior): \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a and 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline E (Personal Conduct):  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

(Tr. at 6, 14-20; 108) \nFindings of Fact \nIn her Answer, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e; she admitted, in part, \nand denied, in part, SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g. At the hearing and without objection, Applicant \namended her Answer to SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.g, admitting both allegations. She is 29 years \nold. As of the date of the hearing and since November 2021, she was separated from her \nspouse, whom she married in 2011, at age 18. She has a child from a previous \nrelationship, a minor, who has special needs. (Answer; Tr. at 7, 21-29, 46-47, 57, 80-81; \nGE 1, 3) \nApplicant graduated from high school in 2011. She earned an associate\u2019s degree \nin 2015 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in aerospace engineering in 2017. As of the date of the \nhearing, she was working towards her master\u2019s degree in aerospace engineering and \nmechanics. She worked for her employer, a DOD contractor, since March 2019. She \ninitially worked 12-hour rotating shifts as a satellite controller, but she was promoted in \napproximately November 2020 to a satellite engineer. She was granted a security \nclearance in approximately 2019. (Answer; Tr. at 7, 21-29, 75, 79-81, 89; GE 1-3; AE A, \nF) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant used: marijuana from approximately August 2008 \nto September 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.a); illegal stimulants (primarily ecstasy) from approximately \nAugust 2011 to August 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); hallucinogens (including mushrooms, LSD, and \nlab/synthetic hallucinogens) from August 2011 to August 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); cocaine from \nMarch 2015 to August 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); and prescription medication Adderall, not \nprescribed to her, from September 2010 to March 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.e). It also alleged that \nApplicant purchased hallucinogens on the dark web and then resold them between \nSeptember 2011 and August 2019 (SOR \u00b6 1.f); and purchased illegal stimulants on the \ndark web and then resold them between September 2011 and March 2017 (SOR \u00b6 1.g). \nApplicant acknowledged that curiosity would likely have led her to try drugs, but \nshe attributed the extent of her drug involvement to her spouse\u2019s influence. She described \nhim as an \u201cincredibly chronic\u201d marijuana user. When she met him, he was already \nsupplying and selling drugs.

He suffered from depressive episodes. \nDuring an episode, he consumed large quantities of alcohol \u201cand other things,\u201d and he \nabused her. She endured his abuse throughout their relationship, and his abuse \nworsened during the COVID-19 pandemic. After an abusive incident that left her \u201creally \nscared\u201d and felt different than before, she left him and took her son with her. Her fear of \nher spouse affected her ability to function, both while she was with him and since leaving \nhim. Since leaving him, she attended weekly individual and group therapy, through which \nshe learned coping mechanisms. She had no future intent to have any contact with him \nand she intended to seek a divorce. She had anxiety, difficulty concentrating, and memory \nloss, especially concerning anything related to him. She stated:  \n[I]t\u2019s hard for me to remember anything that\u2019s like associated with my \nhusband.

After SCA 1, she was \ninterviewed by a background investigator in January 2020 and May 2020. After SCA 2, \nshe was interviewed by the same background investigator in September 2020. Applicant \ndid not have a copy of SCA 1 or SCA 2 to reference during the interviews. She received \nand responded to GE 2, in which she adopted the ROIs that summarized her interviews \nwith the background investigator, during the COVID-19 pandemic and the height of her \nspouse\u2019s abuse. She did not review GE 2 as closely as she could have, she remembered \nthings incorrectly, and she did not reference SCA 1 or SCA 2 when reviewing GE 2. She \nstated that her drug disclosures on SCA 1 most accurately reflected her drug involvement, \nsince it was the closest in time to the period in which she was using, buying, and selling \ndrugs.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of Exec. Or. \n10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nExec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or \nsensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes the following applicable conditions that could raise security \nconcerns under AG \u00b6 25: \n(a) any substance misuse . . . ; and, \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia. \nApplicant used marijuana from 2008 to 2015, and in 2019. She used illegal \nstimulants between 2011 and 2019. She used ecstasy from 2011 to 2015, and in 2019. \nShe used cocaine from 2015 to 2019. She used prescription medication Adderall, not \nprescribed to her, from 2010 to 2015. She used hallucinogenic drugs from 2011 to 2016, \nand in 2019. She purchased illegal stimulants and hallucinogenic drugs on the dark web \nand then resold them between 2011 and 2015. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) and 25(c) are established. \nConditions that could mitigate the drug involvement and substance misuse security \nconcerns are provided under AG \u00b6 26. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant testified that she had no intention to use, purchase, or sell illegal drugs \nin the future. She submitted a signed statement of intent in August 2021 that she would \nabstain from any drug involvement and substance misuse, and that violation of such \nwould be grounds for revocation of her national security eligibility. She no longer \nsocializes with individuals who use, buy, or sell drugs, to include her spouse from whom \nshe separated in November 2021 with an intent to divorce. She also no longer frequents \nplaces where drugs are used or sold. \nHowever, Applicant\u2019s drug involvement spanned a period of 11 years. As recently \nas 2019, when she was working for her current employer, she used marijuana, ecstasy, \ncocaine, and hallucinogens. She also purchased and sold illegal stimulants and \nhallucinogenic drugs on the dark web and then resold them between 2011 and 2015. \nGiven her lengthy past drug involvement, the record evidence continues to raise doubts \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. I find that AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a), \n26(b)(1), 26(b)(2), and 26(b)(3) are not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-\nperson analysis. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the security concerns involving drug involvement and substance misuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.g:   \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

(GE 2, 3, 4) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant petitioned for Chapter 13 bankruptcy in May \n2020, in which he claimed approximately $331,810 in outstanding liabilities, and that his \nbankruptcy petition was dismissed in June 2020 based upon his motion for dismissal \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a).

In addition to his admissions in his Answer, Applicant\u2019s \nbankruptcy case and consumer debts are established by bankruptcy court records. He \nalso disclosed and discussed his delinquent debts on SCA 2 and during background \ninterviews from March 2020 and September 2020. A credit report from March 2020 also \nreports Applicant\u2019s delinquent consumer debts. (GE 1 - 11) \nWhen Applicant completed SCA 1, he disclosed that he was experiencing \nfinancial problems. He attributed them to his period of unemployment from 2009 to \n2011. He supported himself with personal savings and unemployment benefits. He \nstated that he had worked with a debt settlement company (Company A) since early \n2010, and Company A provided him with credit counseling; was negotiating settlements \nfor five of his delinquent debts that totaled $57,300; and settled two of his five debts.

(GE 3) \nIn SCA 2 and during his March 2020 background interview, Applicant again \ndisclosed that he was having financial problems. He cited his divorce as the reason for \nhis delinquent debts and bankruptcy. In addition to his living expenses, he was assigned \nresponsibility for the debts incurred during his marriage and he was ordered to pay \nattorney\u2019s fees for his ex-spouse and alimony. He became overwhelmed. He \nacknowledged during his March 2020 background interview that he did not live within \nhis means while maintaining his and his ex-spouse\u2019s households, and stated that he \nmade changes that would allow him to resolve his debts. He stated in SCA 2 and during \nhis March 2020 background interview that he contracted with a credit counseling service \n(Company B) from May 2019 through July 2023, at $894 monthly. Company B provided \nhim with credit counseling; was negotiating settlements for five of his debts that totaled \n$67,571; and settled one of his five debts. The September 2020 background interview \nreflected that Applicant provided documentation corroborating his contract and \npayments to Company B beginning in May 2019. (GE 2, 4; AE A) \nIn May 2020, Applicant petitioned for Chapter 13 bankruptcy, as previously \ndiscussed (SOR \u00b6 1.a). He listed as liabilities all of his consumer debts alleged in the \nSOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b - 1.g). Court records reflect that Applicant voluntarily sought dismissal \nof his Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition in June 2020, \u201cas he is unable to move forward at \nthis time,\u201d and the court dismissed his case without a discharge. He stated in his \nAnswer that he was working with a credit counseling service (Company C) to \u201cremove \nthis item.\u201d He also explained that he chose to withdraw his bankruptcy petition because \nhe and his ex-spouse agreed that she would instead petition for bankruptcy, and he \nwould pay her additional money in alimony monthly to help her pay the outstanding \nmortgage so that she could obtain a loan to buy the house from under him. (GE 1, 6, 7, \n8; AE A) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b is for a $12,087 account in collection. Applicant acknowledged in SCA \n2 that he had a debt to this creditor for approximately $13,000, and he indicated during \nhis March 2020 background interview that he overlooked and then forgot about this \ndebt, and he would pay it when he was able to do so. He listed this debt in his Chapter \n13 bankruptcy petition. In November 2021, he entered into an agreement with a debt \nrelief service (Company D) to assist him with settling this debt. (GE 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c is for a $10,761 account in collection. Applicant indicated during his \nMarch 2020 background interview and stated in his Answer that Company B was in the \nprocess of negotiating a settlement on this debt. He listed this debt in his Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy petition. In March 2021, he agreed to settle this debt for $4,842. He did not \nprovide proof of payment.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. Section 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern pertaining to financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information.

An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. AG \u00b6 19(a), an \u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d Applicant has a history of not paying his debts and being \nunable to do so. The above disqualifying conditions apply. \nI have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 and find the \nfollowing relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nConditions beyond Applicant\u2019s control, as previously discussed, contributed to \nhis financial problems. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), he must provide evidence \nthat he acted responsibly under his circumstances. He received financial counseling \nthrough his Chapter 13 bankruptcy. However, although he petitioned for Chapter 13 \nbankruptcy in May 2020 in an attempt to get control of his finances, his bankruptcy \ncase was voluntarily dismissed within a month of his petition because he was unable to \nmove forward. His claims that he sought dismissal of his bankruptcy petition in order to \nassist his ex-spouse with her bankruptcy petition so that she could resolve the \noutstanding mortgage and buy the house from him, and that he paid the outstanding \nmortgage through an inheritance, are uncorroborated. He did not provide \ndocumentation to corroborate his claimed efforts to resolve his delinquent consumer \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndebts through Company B, C, or D. He did not provide proof of payment to corroborate \nhis claim that he settled SOR \u00b6 1.c for $4,482. I find that Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties \ncontinue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) are not applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with \nquestions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nFor all these reasons, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

(Tr. at 38-42; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 3) \nAn arrest warrant was issued, and Applicant was charged with two felony counts \nof property damage. Pursuant to a plea bargain, in about February 2022, he pleaded \nguilty to two misdemeanor counts of property damage. He was required to make \nrestitution of $1,625 and $1,490 to the two victims, and he was sentenced to probation \nfor one year. Terms of the probation included no contact with the victims and payment \nof court costs. (Tr. at 15, 38-41; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 3, 6, 7; AE 1) \nApplicant testified that he has not had any alcohol since the incident in February \n2020. He admitted that he told a background investigator in August 2020 that he \ncontinued to regularly drink until shortly before the interview.

He failed to report any of his criminal arrests or charges under any of the \npertinent questions. (Tr. at 29-30; GE 1) \nApplicant was interviewed for his background investigation in August 2020. When \nasked if he had been arrested within the last seven years, if he had ever been charged \nwith a felony, and if he had ever been charged with a drug or alcohol-related offense, he \nanswered \u201cno\u201d to each question. He discussed his 2016 DWI after being specifically \nconfronted with it. He stated that he did not report the DWI on the SF 86 and discuss it \nwith the investigator because he did not know if it would show up on a records check. \nApplicant then also discussed his 2015 and 2020 offenses. He stated that he did not \nreport the 2020 arrest and charges on the SF 86 because he thought if his current \nemployer knew about the charges, he would not have been hired. (Tr. at 30-32; GE 1, \n2) \n \nApplicant denied intentionally providing false information on the SF 86. In his \nresponse to the SOR, he wrote that he \u201cdid not fully understand what charge meant,\u201d \nand that he thought that since he had a lawyer and the charges were reduced, he was \nnot being charged at the time. When asked at hearing why he did not report that he had \nbeen arrested, he testified: \u201cI believe negligence of the law. I thought - - I felt like I was \njust being like in a hold, and I hadn\u2019t gotten arrested yet, like until my case got to trial.\u201d \nHe testified that he thought the 2016 DWI charge had been reduced to littering. Other \nthan Applicant\u2019s testimony, there is no evidence that the DWI charge had been reduced \nto littering. Applicant could not explain why he did not report a conviction for littering. \n(Tr.at 14-15, 27-30, 33-34, 46-47; Applicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process.

Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15, as follows: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified information. Of special interest is any failure to provide truthful \nand candid answers during the security clearance process or any other \nfailure to cooperate with the security clearance process. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying.

AG \u00b6 16(a) is applicable. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant denied that he lied on the SF 86.

It would be inconsistent to find his conduct mitigated.1 \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern for alcohol consumption is set out in AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 22. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or \nother incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \n(c) habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nApplicant was arrested in September 2016 with a .19% BAC and charged with \nDWI. He broke both of his wrists in a motorcycle accident in about 2017 after he had \nbeen drinking. He was drunk in February 2020 and \u201ckeyed\u201d his friend\u2019s car and his \nfriend\u2019s girlfriend\u2019s car. The above disqualifying conditions are applicable. \n1 See ISCR Case 03-22819 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 20, 2006), in which the Appeal Board reversed the \nAdministrative Judge\u2019s decision to grant Applicant\u2019s security clearance: \nOnce the Administrative Judge found that Applicant deliberately falsified a security \nclearance application in September 2002, the Judge could not render a favorable security \nclearance decision without articulating a rational basis for why it would be clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant \ndespite the falsification. Here, the Judge gives reasons as to why he considers the \nfalsification mitigated under a \u201cwhole person\u201d analysis, namely that Applicant has \nmatured, has held a position of responsibility, recognizes how important it is to be candid \nin relation to matters relating to her security clearance, and has changed her behavior so \nthat there is little likelihood of recurrence. However, the Judge\u2019s conclusion runs contrary \nto the Judge\u2019s rejection of Applicant\u2019s explanations for the security clearance application \nfalsification. At the hearing (after earlier admitting the falsification in her March 2003 \nwritten statement to a security investigator), Applicant testified that she had not \nintentionally falsified her application. Given the Judge\u2019s rejection of this explanation as \nnot being credible, it follows that the Judge could not have concluded Applicant now \nrecognizes the importance of candor and has changed her behavior. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThere is no evidence that alcohol was a factor in the 2015 assault charge. SOR \u00b6 \n1.b is concluded for Applicant.  \nConditions that could mitigate alcohol consumption security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 23. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations; and \n(d) the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along \nwith any required aftercare, and has demonstrated a clear and established \npattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \nApplicant provided inconsistent statements about his drinking. He told a \nbackground investigator in August 2020 that he had continued to regularly drink until \nshortly before the interview. He testified that he has not had any alcohol since the \nincident in February 2020. He then testified he lied to the investigator so that he would \nnot receive a clearance. I have no confidence in any of Applicant\u2019s testimony. None of \nthe mitigating conditions are sufficient to overcome concerns about his alcohol use, \nreliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol-related conduct is cross-alleged under criminal conduct. He \nwas also arrested for assault, which was not alcohol related. The above disqualifying \ncondition is applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant has several criminal offenses; he is on probation until February 2023; \nand he cannot be trusted to tell the truth. I am unable to determine that criminal conduct \nis unlikely to recur. His conduct continues to cast doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. I have unmitigated concerns under the same \nrationale discussed in the alcohol consumption analysis. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guidelines E, G and J in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c\u00ad 1.g, and 1.j. He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.h, and 1.i. His admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 41-year-old help-desk representative employed by defense contractors since November 2016. He was hired by his current employer in February 2022. (Tr. 12.) He held non-federal jobs as a mail clerk from May 2005 to December 2010, a part-time recruiter for a college from July 2013 to November 2016, and a site representative for a major corporation from August 2013 until November 2016, when he was hired by a defense contractor. (GX 1 at 13-17.) His SCA does not reflect whether he was employed between December 2010 and July 2013. He has never married and has no children. Applicant earned about $12 per hour and worked 40 hours per week from August 2013 to November 2016. His pay increased to about $23 per hour when he began working for defense contractors.

On May 13, 2022, the Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was scheduled \nto be conducted by video teleconference on June 14, 2022. I convened the hearing as \nscheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 6 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through F, which \nwere admitted without objection. I kept the record open until June 30, 2022, to enable him \nto submit additional documentary evidence. He timely submitted AX G through H, which \nwere admitted without objection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on June 22, 2022. \nThe record closed on June 30, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.c\u00ad\n1.g, and 1.j. He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.h, and 1.i. His admissions are \nincorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 41-year-old help-desk representative employed by defense \ncontractors since November 2016. He was hired by his current employer in February \n2022. (Tr. 12.) He held non-federal jobs as a mail clerk from May 2005 to December 2010, \na part-time recruiter for a college from July 2013 to November 2016, and a site \nrepresentative for a major corporation from August 2013 until November 2016, when he \nwas hired by a defense contractor. (GX 1 at 13-17.) His SCA does not reflect whether he \nwas employed between December 2010 and July 2013. He has never married and has \nno children. \nApplicant earned about $12 per hour and worked 40 hours per week from August \n2013 to November 2016. His pay increased to about $23 per hour when he began working \nfor defense contractors. (Tr. 27-29.). \nApplicant attended college from August 1999 to May 2004, January to May 2006, \nand August 2015 to October 2016. He did not receive a degree, but he received a \ncertificate as a dental assistant in in November 2016. (GX 1 at 11-12; AX D.) He recently \ncompleted an online course and received a certificate in workplace diversity and inclusion. \n(Tr. 26.) \nApplicant served in the U.S. Air Force Reserve (USAFR) from December 2010 to \nJanuary 2016 and received an honorable discharge. He was a senior airman (pay grade \nE-4), serving as an aircraft crew chief. He received a security clearance in February 2012. \nThe document notifying him that his application for a clearance was granted cautioned \nhim about the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts and failure to fully disclose \nthe debts in his SCA. (GX 5.) \nApplicant underwent surgery for a brain tumor in December 2019 and was unable \nto work until early February 2020. (Tr. 32.)

(AX B.) \nThe SOR alleges two delinquent student loans (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.j), five \ndelinquent medical debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.g), and three consumer debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.h, \nand 1.i). The delinquent debts are reflected in credit reports from December 2020, June \n2021, and April 2022. (GX 2, 3, and 4.) The evidence concerning the debts is summarized \nbelow. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a: student loan placed for collection of $62,237. This loan first became \ndelinquent in November 2017 (GX 3 at 3.) Payments on this loan were about $350 per \nmonth. Collection of this loan was deferred until August 31, 2022. Applicant made two \npayments on the debt that were returned to him because of the deferment. (AX H; Tr. 16.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b: credit-card account placed for collection of $791. This debt first \nbecame delinquent in September 2015, and it was charged off in December 2020. (GX 3 \nat 2). He made a payment on this debt after he was interviewed by a security investigator \nin February 2021. (GX 6 at 4.) It was paid in full in April 2022. (AX G; Tr. 17-18.) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.g: medical debts for $809, $349, $273, $225, and $348, totaling \n$2,004, placed for collection by the same collection agency. Applicant testified that \nthese medical debts were incurred in December 2019, when he underwent surgery for a \nbrain tumor. (AX A.) His surgery was covered by his medical insurance, and the amounts \nalleged in the SOR are copayments. (Tr. 44.) They were referred for collection in \nDecember 2020. (GX 2 at 3.) He was making payments on his medical debts when he \nwas interviewed by a security investigator in February 2021. (GX 6 at 3.) He is now paying \n$30-$40 per month to the collection agency. One of the debts has been paid and four \ndebts remain delinquent. (AX I; Tr. 19-20, 40.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: telecommunication service bill placed for collection of $406. This \ndebt was incurred for failure to return equipment. It was placed for collection in November \n2020. (GX 2 at 3.) Applicant paid it in full shortly after he was interviewed by a security \ninvestigator in February 2021. (GX 6 at 3; Tr. 21, 39.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.i: credit-union debt placed for collection of $499. This debt was \ncharged off in February 2018. (GX 2 at 5.) Applicant told a security investigator that he \npaid it in 2018. (GX 6 at 2.) However, the evidence he submitted at the hearing reflects \nthat he did not pay it in full until June 2022. (AX C; Tr. 39.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.j: student loan placed for collection of $24,370. This student loan was \ntransferred to the same creditor as the loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. (AX J.) It first became \ndelinquent in June 2015. (GX 3 at 3.)

He completed a personal income and expense analysis reflecting total \nmonthly income of $4,483 and expenses of $3,719. He lives in a rental property and owns \na car that is fully paid for. He has budgeted $375 per month for student loans once the \ndeferment ends. (AX L.) \nApplicant\u2019s neighbor has known him for about 18 months and considers him a \ncaring and reliable friend, and he trusted Applicant to take care of his apartment during a \ntwo-month absence.

A Navy lieutenant who has known Applicant \nfor 15 years describes him as dependable, responsible, honest, and courteous. (AX K.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). The following mitigating \nconditions are potentially applicable: \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established. Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous, recent, \nand were not incurred under circumstances making recurrence unlikely. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is partially established. Applicant\u2019s medical problem was a condition \nlargely beyond his control. However, it is not applicable to his delinquent student loans \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a and 1.j, the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b, or the debt alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.i, which were delinquent before his medical problems arose. It is not applicable to the \ncommunications debt in SOR \u00b6 1.h, because his failure to return equipment was unrelated \nto his medical problem. It is applicable to the medical debts that were not fully covered by \nhis medical insurance. Applicant has acted responsibly regarding the medical debts by \nmaking regular payments on them. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is partially established. Applicant sought and received credit \ncounseling. He has resolved the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.h, and 1.i, and he is \nmaking payments on the medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.g. He has devised a \nbudget that will enable him to begin making payments on the student loans alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.a and 1.j when the deferment ends. Notwithstanding the forbearance, \nAppellant\u2019s student loans had been delinquent for several years before the forbearance \nwent into effect. Accordingly, there is a continuing concern that Appellant will not make \nthe required payments on his student loans when they are no longer in forbearance. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not established. Applicant was warned in February 2012 that his \ndelinquent debts were a concern, but he did not seriously address them until he was \nquestioned about them by a security investigator in February 2021 and he realized that \nhis delinquent debts were an impediment to holding a security clearance. He has been \nemployed steadily since at least August 2013 and his income increased substantially \nwhen he was employed by a defense contractor in November 2016.

May 30, 2018). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant was sincere and candid at the \nhearing. I have considered his service in the USAFR and the fact that he held a security \nclearance in the USAFR. \nApplicant demonstrated at the hearing that he is capable of sound financial \nmanagement, but he has not yet established a track record of doing so. I am not \nconvinced that he will continue his recent responsible conduct after the pressure of \nkeeping his security clearance is removed. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his \ndelinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.g: \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.h-1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

The case was assigned to me on March 18, 2022. The initial notice \nof hearing was issued on May 13, 2022, convening a hearing for June 1, 2022. Before \nthe hearing, Applicant was injured in an accident and requested a postponement, which \nI granted. I convened the rescheduled hearing on June 17, 2022.

He stated he had sufficient time to prepare for the hearing and was ready to \nproceed. (Tr. 10) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 29 years old. He graduated from high school in 2010. He enlisted in \nthe Army in 2012, and served on active duty four years. He was a sergeant (E-5) at the \ntime of his honorable discharge in February 2016. He married in 2015, and he has two \nchildren ages seven and four. He attended college, on and off, between 2016 and August \n2020, but he has not earned a degree. \nFollowing his discharge, Applicant was unemployed for about two weeks. He then \nworked for two different employers for short periods. His current employer and security \nclearance sponsor hired him in November 2016. He has not had any periods of \nunemployment or underemployment since. The Department of Defense (DOD) granted \nhim eligibility for a clearance in 2012. He stated that he never had any security issues or \nconcerns, except for those in the SOR. \nWhen he started working with his current employer in 2016, Applicant was making \nabout $50,000 a year. Shortly thereafter, he was promoted and his earnings increased to \n$75,000, and then to $100,000. He and his wife each have been making $100,000 a year \nsince at least 2019. Their combined income is $200,000 annually. (Tr. 41-42) He has a \nmonthly net remainder of over $1,700. (Tr.45) \nApplicant submitted his most recent security clearance application (SCA) on \nAugust 3, 2020, seeking the continuation of his clearance eligibility required for his job. In \nSection 26 (Financial Record) of his 2020 SCA, he disclosed he \u201chad issues after he took \nout a loan\u201d in 2017, and defaulted on it. He claimed he was working to resolve his \ndelinquent debt. \nThe subsequent background investigation revealed the 12 delinquent accounts \nalleged in the SOR (four charged-off and eight in collection), totaling about $43,000. In \nhis answer to the SOR, Applicant denied SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.d, 1.e, 1.h, 1.j, and 1.k. He \nadmitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.f, 1.g, 1.i, and 1.i. He stated that he had been resolving his \ndelinquent debts and promised that if he had not resolved some of them, he was willing \nto do so. All of the SOR allegations are established by his admissions and the record \nevidence. \nAt his hearing, Applicant testified that he started to contact his creditors and sought \nto settle or pay his delinquent debts, after he received the SOR. He claimed he paid SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.g, 1.k, and 1.l, and disputed 1.h.

He \ntook no action to resolve his debts after he submitted his 2020 SCA, received the July \n2021 SOR, or after his hearing. He presented no evidence to establish that he has \nparticipated in any recent financial counseling. \nApplicant explained that his financial problems were the result of him being young \nand immature. He accrued most of the SOR debts when he was in the service. It was his \nfirst time away from home, and he did not know how to handle his finances. He did not \ntake his financial responsibilities seriously, did not pay his debts, and he let the accounts \nbecome delinquent. He stated he was careless and irresponsible because he did not \naddress his delinquent debts. (Tr. 48) He claimed that he now understands the severity \nof the consequences caused by his financial irresponsibility, and how his financial \nirresponsibility could be a concern to the Government. \nApplicant described his current financial situation as good. He and his wife were \nconsidering buying a home. He believes that he should be able to pay his delinquent \naccounts in the near future by using the services of a debt consolidation company. He \nstated he has never been the type to shy away from hard work or to make excuses. He \ntakes responsibility for his financial problems, promised to fix them and not to allow it to \nhappen again in the future. \nIn July 2021, Applicant contacted a debt relief company and requested information \nabout the process to retain their services. (AE 1) His documentary evidence does not \nshow that he retained the services of the debt relief company. There is no documentary \nevidence that he signed a contract, or of any payments made to the debt relief company \nfrom July 2021 to present. He averred he and his wife are in the process of establishing \na new budget including his delinquent accounts. \nApplicant testified that he takes his responsibilities as a security clearance holder \nvery seriously. He noted that he has had a clearance since 2012, when he was in the \nservice. He considers himself to be trustworthy, reliable, and honest. His references \nspeak highly about him. They consider him to be efficient, detail-oriented, competent, and \npossessing a strong drive to succeed. He is among the top five employees within his \ncompany and has received numerous performance awards. His references endorsed his \neligibility for a clearance without reservations. \nPolicies \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive) \n(January 2, 1992), as amended; and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June 8, 2017. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The \nU.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in \nregulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno one \nhas a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 \n(1988). \nThe AGs list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition \nis not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AGs should be followed where a case can be \nmeasured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to classified \ninformation. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration \nof the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and 2(f). All available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, must \nbe considered. \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, the \nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance.  \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling \ninterest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. The \u201cclearly \nconsistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any reasonable doubt \nabout an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \u201c[S]ecurity \nclearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. \nat 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance decisions are not \na determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are merely an indication \nthat the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the Government has established \nfor issuing a clearance. (See Section 7 of EO 10865; See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) \n(listing prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information)) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe evidence establishes Applicant accumulated 12 delinquent accounts, totaling \n$43,000, that have been delinquent for several years. The record establishes the \ndisqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), requiring additional inquiry about the \npossible applicability of mitigating conditions. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nNone of the above mitigating conditions is applicable to Applicant\u2019s case. His \nfinancial problems are frequent, recent, and ongoing. He did not establish that \ncircumstances beyond his control caused or contributed to his financial problems. \nMoreover, his evidence is insufficient to show that he was financially responsible under \nhis circumstances. Applicant started working for a federal contractor in June 2016, \nearning $50,000 a year, and shortly thereafter he was promoted and his earnings \nincreased to $75,000 and then to $100,000. He has been making $100,000 a year for at \nleast two years. He and his wife\u2019s combined income is $200,000 annually. \nApplicant presented no documentary evidence of efforts to contact his creditors, \nof any payments made, of settlement agreements negotiated, or of payment plans \nestablished to resolve his delinquent accounts. He took no action to resolve his delinquent \naccounts after he submitted his 2020 SCA, was questioned about his financial problems \nduring his interview, received the SOR, or participated in his hearing. I am unable to find \nthat he acted responsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to \npay his debts. Considering his annual earnings, Applicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to \nexplain why he has been unable to address his delinquent accounts. Applicant claimed \nhe paid or resolved three accounts and disputed another. He failed to submit \ndocumentary evidence to corroborate his claims. \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, there is insufficient evidence for a \ndetermination that Applicant has been financially responsible and that his financial \nproblems are under control. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue \nto cast serious doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find \nthat the security concerns arising out of Applicant\u2019s financial problems are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant, 29, receives credit for four years of honorable military service, and his \nservice to a federal contractor since 2016; all while possessing eligibility for a clearance. \nHe explained his young age and immaturity led him into financial problems. Those factors \nnotwithstanding, his evidence is insufficient to explain why he did not address his \ndelinquent accounts until after he received the SOR. He did not provide persuasive \ndocumentary evidence showing he made specific and reasonable efforts to resolve his \ndebts. His lack of documented responsible financial action concerning these debts raises \nunmitigated questions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation. See AG \u00b6 18. The record evidence leaves me with serious questions and \ndoubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo.12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). This decision should not be construed as a \ndetermination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for \naward of a security clearance in the future. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of EO 10865, \u201cAny determination under this order \nadverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest and shall \nin no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO \n12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive \ninformation). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Drug Involvement and Substance \nMisuse is set forth at AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 25 contains seven conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Three conditions are established: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nAppellant used marijuana on numerous occasions from 2007~2008, and again \nfrom 2019~2020. She had been granted access to classified information during the period \nthat she used marijuana at least seven times. Therefore, AG \u00b6 25 (a), (c), and (f) are \nestablished. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 26 contains four conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Two conditions may be applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \ndrug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that \nany future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility. \nNone of these apply. Although her last usage of marijuana was about two years \nago, Applicant used the illegal substance on at least seven occasions while granted \naccess to classified information. Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse is found \nagainst Applicant. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result in \nan unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance \naction, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or \ncooperate with security processing, including but not limited \nto meeting with a security investigator for subject interview, \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncompleting security forms or releases, cooperation with \nmedical \nor \npsychological \nevaluation, \nor \npolygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful \nquestions of investigators, security officials, or other official \nrepresentatives in connection with a personnel security or \ntrustworthiness determination. \nBased on Applicant\u2019s alleged deliberate falsification of her SCA and her drug use, \nthe following disqualifying condition could apply: \nAG \u00b6 16 (a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person assessment of \nquestionable judgment . . . indicating that the individual may not properly \nsafeguard classified information. \nWhile I find that Applicant did not falsify her SCA, Applicant\u2019s use of marijuana \nwhile granted access to classified information is problematic. Therefore, AG \u00b6 16(c) is \nestablished. \nThe personal conduct security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by \nthe following potentially applicable factor: \nAG \u00b6 17 (c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAfter considering the mitigating condition outlined above, I find that it does not \napply.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, age 42, is married with one 18-year-old child. The record did not indicate his education background. He has not served in the military. This is his first application for a security clearance. (Item 2) The SOR alleged six delinquent debts totaling $57,000, including a $41,110 past- due mortgage account in foreclosure status. In his Answer, Applicant admitted all but one (SOR \u00b6 1.c/$386) of the alleged debts, without explanation. His admitted debts totaled $56,614. Applicant\u2019s March 2021 credit bureau report (CBR) corroborated SOR \u00b6 1.c. His September 2021 CBR reported the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f as a paid charge-off with a $0 balance. He paid an amount not indicated in the record to settle that debt (with a reported balance of $8,677) for less than the full balance.

On \nOctober 12, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guideline F. The CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nOn December 17, 2021, Applicant responded to the SOR (Answer), and requested \na decision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing. On March 15, 2022, the \nGovernment sent Applicant a complete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material \n(FORM) including evidentiary documents identified as Items 1 through 5.

The case was assigned to me on July 21, 2022. \nEvidentiary Matters \nItem 1 contains the pleadings in the case. Items 2 through 5 are admitted into \nevidence. Although Item 3 was not authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20, I \nconclude that Applicant waived any objection to Item 3. The Government included in the \nFORM a prominent notice advising Applicant of his right to object to the admissibility of \nItem 3 on the ground that it was not authenticated. Applicant was also notified that if he \ndid not raise an objection to Item 3 in his response to the FORM, or if he did not respond \nto the FORM, he could be considered to have waived any such objection, and that Item \n3 could be considered as evidence in his case. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 42, is married with one 18-year-old child. The record did not indicate \nhis education background. He has not served in the military. This is his first application \nfor a security clearance. (Item 2) \nThe SOR alleged six delinquent debts totaling $57,000, including a $41,110 past-\ndue mortgage account in foreclosure status. In his Answer, Applicant admitted all but one \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c/$386) of the alleged debts, without explanation. His admitted debts totaled \n$56,614. Applicant\u2019s March 2021 credit bureau report (CBR) corroborated SOR \u00b6 1.c. His \nSeptember 2021 CBR reported the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f as a paid charge-off with a \n$0 balance. He paid an amount not indicated in the record to settle that debt (with a \nreported balance of $8,677) for less than the full balance. (Item 4, 5) \nApplicant promised to investigate and make payment arrangements to resolve his \nindebtedness during his March 2021 and April 2021 security clearance interviews (SIs). \nBecause he did not proffer any explanations in his Answer or respond to the FORM, there \nis no information in the record to confirm whether he followed through on those promises \nor otherwise resolved the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e. (Item 3) \nDuring his SIs, Applicant acknowledged that he had been experiencing financial \nproblems for a little over a year, including a mortgage loan, a car loan, and a credit-card \naccount that had become delinquent. He attributed those delinquent accounts to a \nreduction of income due to a job change and to a lack of income. He did not proffer any \nfurther details about his income or expense history during his SIs. (Item 3) \nApplicant reported the following employment history on his SCA: 1) employed full \ntime from September 2010 through March 2016, when he was laid off due to \u201ceconomic \ndown turn;\u201d 2) employed1 full time from March 2016 through October 2019, when he was \n1 On his SCA, Applicant referenced this employment as \u201cself-employment,\u201d but also provided the following \nreason why he left this employment: \u201cLaid off due to economic down turn.\u201d The record did not address this \ndiscrepancy.  \n \n \n \n \n \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nlaid off due to \u201ceconomic down turn;\u201d and 3) employed by Defense Contractor A from \nOctober 2019 through [then] present. The administrative record indicates that Applicant \nis no longer employed by Defense Contractor A. He was employed by Defense Contractor \nA when he signed the receipt for the SOR in March 2022. As of October 2022, he appears \nto be employed by Defense Contractor B, who is his current sponsor. There is no other \ninformation in the record to indicate the dates he separated from Defense Contractor A \nor began his employment with Defense Contractor B, including the reason for the \nseparation or any resulting unemployment. (Item 2) \nDuring his March 2021 SI, Applicant admitted that he answered \u201cno\u201d to all \nquestions about his financial record on his SCA because he was embarrassed. While he \nclaimed that he had no knowledge of the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.d and \n1.f, he admitted that he had been delinquent on the aforementioned credit-card account \n(SOR \u00b6 1.a), mortgage loan (SOR \u00b6 1.e), and a car loan that was not alleged. Since the \nSOR did not allege facts involving Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose any delinquent debts on \nhis SCA, I will consider it only to evaluate mitigation and the whole person. \nDuring the March 2021 SI, Applicant maintained that he had taken action to resolve \nhis indebtedness beginning in about February 2021. He claimed that he paid off the past-\ndue balance of the car loan (for his truck) and a credit-card account (not SOR \u00b6 1.a). He \nexplained that the truck had been repossessed in about November 2020 due to his \nmonthly payments being about 90 days late in the approximate amount of $1,800. He \nclaimed after he made a payment to bring the loan account current in February 2021, he \nwas able to retain his truck. He did not proffer any details about the credit-card account. \n(Item 3) \nThe March 2021 CBR corroborated that Applicant paid an amount not indicated in \nthe record to settle a credit-card account (with a reported balance of $360) for less than \nthe full balance. It also corroborated that he brought the 90-day delinquent car loan \ncurrent and that the account was then in good standing. The September 2021 CBR \nconfirmed that he had then remained current on the car loan. (Items 3, 4) \nDuring the March 2021 SI, Applicant promised to pay more attention to what credit \ncards he had and to reduce their balances. He acknowledged that his financial situation \ncould be a lot better and anticipated that it would improve once he had a handle on what \nneeds to be paid. He asserted that he wanted to get out of debt and intended to start \nworking on paying off accounts to get caught up with his bills. He averred that there is no \nreason for anyone to question his ability or willingness to repay his debts or live within his \nmeans. (Item 3) \nApplicant also answered \u201cno\u201d to the questions in police record section on his SCA, \nincluding whether he had ever been charged with an offense involving alcohol or drugs. \nThe police record section included the instruction: \u201cFor this section report information \nregardless of whether the record in your case has been sealed, expunged, or otherwise \nstricken from the court record, or the charge was dismissed.\u201d During his March 2021 SI, \nApplicant confirmed his \u201cno\u201d responses. After being confronted, he agreed that he had \nbeen charged in January 2000 with driving under the influence (DUI).

(Item 2, 3) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \n4 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nfacts.

Sep. 22, 2005)) \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012)) \nWith the exception of SOR \u00b6 1.f, the record evidence establishes the following \ndisqualifying condition under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial \nobligations). Because the debt was resolved prior to the issuance of the SOR, I find SOR \n\u00b6 1.f in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nI considered all of the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the concern \nunder this guideline and find the following relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is established to the extent that Applicant was either underemployed \nor unemployed due to involuntary layoffs. However, I am unable to fully apply AG \u00b6 20(b) \nbecause the record lacked sufficient detail for me to conclude that his debts persisted \nlargely due to circumstances beyond his control or that he acted responsibly to resolve \nhis debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) is established only to the unalleged car loan and credit-card account \nthat Applicant settled. However, he failed to establish that he paid or otherwise resolved \nthe debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e. I am unable to conclude that his \nindebtedness is not likely to recur and no longer casts doubt on his reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and judgment. Thus, I find that neither AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (b), nor (d) are fully \nestablished to mitigate the Guideline F concerns. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised \nby his delinquent debts. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant him eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \nEmbarrassment is not an excuse to omit security relevant information during the \nsecurity clearance process. Moreover, Applicant was on notice that he was required to \ndisclose his DUI charge regardless of whether it was dismissed or may have been \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nexpunged from his record. While Applicant\u2019s lack of candor with respect to his failure to \nreport any derogatory information on his SCA is troubling, it did not serve as a basis for \ndenying him a security clearance this time. However, Applicant is cautioned that any \nsubsequent failure to be forthright and honest on any future SCA could negatively affect \nhis security clearance worthiness. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

In her SOR answer, Applicant admitted each alleged debt.

She did not have health insurance during periods when she worked for employers who did not offer health insurance. During her June 2020 security clearance interview, she expressed an intent to resolve her medical debts via a payment plan with the help of a state Medicaid program she found.

Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on May 7, 2020. On \nJune 24, 2021, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF) sent her a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline \nF. The CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on \nJune 8, 2017.  \nApplicant answered the SOR on August 26, 2021, and requested a decision based \non the written record in lieu of a hearing. On September 23, 2021, the Government sent \nApplicant a complete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), including \nevidentiary documents identified as Items 1 through 7.

On December 13, 2021, I \ncontacted Applicant by phone and left a voicemail message to follow up. I did not receive \nany response from Applicant. I closed the record on December 14, 2021. \nEvidentiary Matters \nApplicant\u2019s SOR answer included documents that I admitted into evidence as \nApplicant Exhibits (AE) A and B. Items 1 and 2 contain the pleadings in the case. Items \n3 through 7 are admitted into evidence. Item 7 was not authenticated as required by \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.20. However, I conclude that Applicant waived any objection to Item 7. \nThe Government included in the FORM a prominent notice advising Applicant of her right \nto object to the admissibility of Item 7 on the ground that it was not authenticated. \nApplicant was also notified that if she did not raise an objection to Item 7 in her response \nto the FORM, or if she did not respond to the FORM, she could be considered to have \nwaived any such objection, and that Item 7 could be considered as evidence in her case. \nApplicant did not respond to the FORM or object to Item 7. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 37, is a single mother of three children, ages 15, 16, and 18. She \nhas never been married. She attended community college from May through August \n2019. She has been employed as a custodian by a defense contractor since March 2020. \nThis is her first application for a security clearance. (Item 3) \nThe SOR alleged 30 delinquent debts totaling $51,008, including 25 medical \naccounts totaling $35,570; one $11,606 federal social security administration (SSA) \naccount; and four consumer accounts totaling $3,832. In her SOR answer, Applicant \nadmitted each alleged debt. (Items 1, 2) \nApplicant attributed the medical debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.t, 1.y, and \n1.aa through 1.dd to expenses she incurred to treat a medical condition when she did not \nhave health insurance. She did not have health insurance during periods when she \nworked for employers who did not offer health insurance. During her June 2020 security \nclearance interview, she expressed an intent to resolve her medical debts via a payment \nplan with the help of a state Medicaid program she found. She anticipated that all of her \nmedical debt would be resolved within two years. In her SOR answer, she asserted that \nshe set up a payment plan to resolve the issue. She did not offer documentary proof of \nthat plan or any payments made. (Item 2; Item 7 at 1-2) \nApplicant attributed the SSA debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.w to an alleged overpayment \nof social security benefits that she received while unemployed. During her 2020 interview, \nApplicant acknowledged that she received a letter from the SSA indicating that she was \noverpaid, but disagreed because she did not know how or why she would have been \noverpaid. She planned to investigate the matter. She intended to pay the debt if it was \ndetermined that she did, in fact, owe the SSA for overpayment.

She opened them to pay for \nexpenses during periods of unemployment. They both became delinquent in November \n2019 and were charged off in April 2020. In her SOR answer, Applicant stated that she \nset up payment plans to resolve the debts. She provided documentary proof of the \narrangement she made with the creditor in August 2021 to resolve the debt alleged in \nSOR \u00b6 1.u, but not of any payments she made pursuant to that arrangement. She did not \noffer documentary proof of either a plan or any payments made towards the debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.v. (AE A; Item 2; Item 4 at 6; Item 7 at 2) \nApplicant incurred the utility debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.x ($1,395) during a period \nwhen she was either unemployed or underemployed. During her 2020 interview, \nApplicant expressed an intent to contact the creditor to set up a payment plan. In her SOR \nanswer, she provided documentary proof of the payment plan she arranged with the \ncreditor in August 2021 to resolve this debt. However, she did not offer documentary proof \nof any payments made pursuant to that plan. (AE B; Item 2; Item 7 at 2) \nApplicant borrowed the funds alleged in SOR 1.z ($252) via a payday loan to pay \nbills during a period when she was unemployed. She made a few payments on the loan \nbefore she defaulted on it. During her 2020 interview, she did not express a specific plan \nto pay this debt, but indicated that she intended to continue making progress on satisfying \nall of her then delinquent debts, which included this loan. In her SOR answer, she \nasserted: \u201cThere was no information on this company,\u201d and did not offer a plan to resolve \nthis debt. (Item 2; Item 7 at 2) \nApplicant\u2019s SCA revealed instability in her employment history, including five \nperiods of unemployment and extended periods of part-time employment between \nJanuary 2010 and March 2020. Her unemployment appeared to have been involuntary in \nall but one instance. The record did not indicate the reason that she worked on a part-\ntime basis, rather than full time. During her June 2020 security clearance interview, \nApplicant described her financial situation as improving because of her new job, which \nnot only provided her with steady employment but also a higher salary. She expressed \nan intent to continue taking positive steps toward satisfying her debts. (Item 3; Item 7 at \n2) \nApplicant reported monthly expenses totaling $1,650 on her February 2021 \npersonal financial statement. Based on the year-to-date salary reported on her February \n2021 pay stub, Applicant\u2019s take-home pay averaged approximately $2,119 per month. \nThe pay stub indicated that her salary varied each pay period. The record did not indicate \nher previous salary or expense history, or whether she had any financial counseling. \nApplicant\u2019s June 2021 credit report revealed that she opened two credit-card accounts in \n2020, with $300 and $800 credit limits and balances of $171 and $496, respectively. Both \nwere in good standing.

Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012)) \nThe record establishes the following two disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (inability to satisfy debts); and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations). \nHaving considered all of the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the \nconcern under this guideline, I find the following relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts appear to have largely resulted from circumstances \nbeyond her control. I considered that they consist primarily of medical expenses. \nHowever, because she did not provide sufficient documentary evidence to support her \nclaims, she failed to meet her burden to establish mitigation under either AG \u00b6 20(a), (b), \nor (d). I credit her with the arrangements she made to resolve the debts alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.u and 1.x. However, without documentary proof, I am unable to conclude that she \nmade any payments pursuant to the plans. Similarly, without documentary proof of the \nother alleged payment plans and the payments she made pursuant to those plans or \notherwise, I am unable to conclude that she initiated and is adhering to the good-faith \nefforts to resolve her debts or that she otherwise acted responsibly to address her debts. \nThere is also insufficient evidence for me to conclude that she is able to repay her debts \nand that her indebtedness is not likely to recur. Thus, I find that Applicant has not \nmitigated the Guideline F concerns at this time. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised \nby her delinquent debts. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried her burden of showing \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant her eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.dd: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with interests of national security to grant \nor continue Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

He received a security clearance in December 2014. He has a \nhigh school education. \nApplicant married in March 2011. After several years in a mutually difficult \nmarriage, his wife filed a divorce petition, which was granted in April 2017. They have an \neight-year-old son, who lives with his mother. \nApplicant testified that he was drinking heavily after the divorce and described \nhimself as a \u201cmess.\u201d He was angry and upset. His ex-wife had begun a relationship with \nanother man within a week after the divorce, and she and their son had moved in with the \nother man. (Tr. 27.) \nIn 2018, Applicant posted \u201ca couple hundred\u201d intimate images of his ex-wife on \npornographic websites on the Internet. Applicant\u2019s ex-wife had taken the images and sent \nthem to him. (Tr. 25.) Before and during the marriage, they had sent sexually-oriented \npictures of themselves to each other. (Tr. 55.) The images that Applicant posted on the \nInternet included images of his ex-wife performing sexual acts. (Tr. 23.) His ex-wife did \nnot consent to posting the images on the Internet. (Tr. 27.) \nWhen Applicant\u2019s ex-wife discovered the images, she filed a criminal complaint \nagainst Applicant for disseminating voyeuristic material. A warrant for Applicant\u2019s arrest \nwas issued but not served. He tried to remove the images, with limited success. He \nestimated that 95% of the images were removed from the websites where he had posted \nthem, but he could not estimate how many had been shared and redistributed. (Tr. 30.) \nIn late 2018, Applicant\u2019s ex-wife and their son moved back in with him. (Tr. 33.) In \nJanuary 2019, his ex-wife accused him of raping their son, who was five years old at the \ntime. She had a drink in her hand and was poking him in the chest with a crowbar. \nApplicant believed that she was drunk. (Tr. 54.) When she tried to prevent him from \nleaving the room, he slapped her.

(Tr. 36-40.) Applicant was arrested, charged with \nassault and disorderly conduct, fingerprinted, and released on his own recognizance \nApplicant was interviewed by an investigator from the child protective service \noffice, and his son was examined by medical personnel, but no further action was taken \nregarding his ex-wife\u2019s accusation of raping their son. (Tr. 37-38.) He hired an attorney to \ndefend himself against the charge of assaulting his ex-wife. \nLater in January 2019, Applicant was stopped by police for a traffic infraction, and \nthe police discovered the outstanding warrant for disseminating voyeuristic material. He \nwas arrested pursuant to the outstanding warrant, taken to the police station, and held \nuntil his ex-wife picked him up at the jail and took him to the courthouse to appear in \nresponse to the assault charge. Under the law of the state where the alleged conduct \noccurred, disseminating voyeuristic material and assault in the third degree are Class A \nmisdemeanors, and disorderly conduct is a Class C misdemeanor. The charges of assault \nand distribution of voyeuristic material were consolidated into a single trial in mid-2019. \nIn November 2019, the court ordered Applicant to attend an eight-week family-violence \neducation class, and the judge informed him that all the charges against him would be \ndismissed if he successfully completed the class. The class was delayed by COVID, but \nApplicant successfully completed the class in October 2020. The charges of assault, \ndisorderly conduct, and distribution of voyeuristic material were dismissed on November \n27, 2020. Applicant was required to pay $400 for the class, plus attorney\u2019s fees. (GX 2 at \n9-18.) \nApplicant testified that he stopped drinking in mid-2018 and concentrated on \nphysical fitness. (Tr. 33.) In March or April 2019, before the court-ordered classes began, \nhe started consulting with a family psychologist. (Tr. 51-52.) He found the personal \ncounseling and the court-ordered classes very helpful. (Tr. 47.) He regrets his behavior. \nHe and his ex-wife now have limited their contact to matters involving their son. He is now \nin a committed relationship with another woman \u201cwho even goes to church on Sundays.\u201d \n(Tr. 59.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR.

The concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \n\u201cCriminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. \nBy its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with \nlaws, rules, and regulations.\u201d \nThe following disqualifying conditions are raised by the evidence: \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially relevant: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \nBoth mitigating conditions are established. The conduct alleged in the SOR \noccurred more than three years ago. All the offenses were misdemeanors and were dealt \nwith by the local court as minor offenses. They happened under circumstances that are \nunlikely to recur. \nThe conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a was an emotional reaction to a painful divorce, \nfueled by excessive alcohol consumption, immaturity, and Applicant\u2019s lack of appreciation \nfor the impact of posting material on a pornographic website. He stopped drinking in mid-\n2018.  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe conduct alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b was triggered by an unfounded accusation by \nApplicant\u2019s ex-wife shortly after their divorce. Applicant sought personal counseling in \naddition to the court-ordered counseling and has gained insight into his behavior. \nThere is no evidence of any other criminal conduct. I am satisfied that the behavior \nalleged in the SOR is unlikely to recur. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe SOR cross-alleges Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct as personal conduct under \nthis guideline. The security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \u201cConduct \ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. . . .\u201d The following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline are raised by the evidence. \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \nAG \u00b6 16(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's \nconduct, that creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress \nby a foreign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes . . . engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person's \npersonal, professional, or community standing . . . . \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior \nis so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is unlikely \nto recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or other \ninappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur. \nBoth mitigating conditions are established, for the reasons set out in the above \ndiscussion of Guideline J. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines J and E in my whole-person \nanalysis and applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant was candid, sincere, \nand remorseful at the hearing. He has worked for a defense contractor and held a security \nclearance for more than seven years. He has stopped drinking. He is no longer in a \ndysfunctional relationship. After weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions \nunder Guidelines J and E, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole \nperson, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his criminal \nconduct and personal conduct. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J (Criminal Conduct): FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E (Personal Conduct): FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nFor Applicant \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is granted. \nLeRoy F.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant, age 40, was divorced from his wife of nearly 14 years in 2018. They have two children, ages 15 and 17. He received his high school diploma in June 1999. He took a few college courses in about 2009 or 2010. He has been employed as a software developer by a defense contractor since 2010. In 2014, that contractor was acquired by another entity, for whom he remains employed as a senior specialist. This is his first application for a DOD security clearance. His background was investigated by another agency in 2018, from whom he received access or clearance eligibility of a type of which he was not aware. (Item 3) Because Applicant denied the one $267,064 debt alleged in the SOR, the Government had the initial burden of proving the alleged facts. It met that burden by proffering a 2021 credit bureau report (CBR) that corroborated the allegation. The burden 2 then shifted to the Applicant to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the alleged facts.

Items 1 and 2 contain the pleadings in the case. Items 3 and \n5 are admitted into evidence. Item 4 is discussed below. The case was assigned to me \non March 3, 2022. \nEvidentiary Matter \nApplicant was interviewed by an investigator on March 3, 2021, in connection with \nthe background investigation initiated by his SCA. Item 4 is summary of the interview \nprepared by the investigator. Item 4 purports to be an accurate summary of the \ninformation that Applicant provided to the investigator during the interview. However, Item \n4 was not authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20, \nThe Government included in the FORM a notice advising Applicant of his right to: \ncomment on whether the summary accurately reflected the information he provided to the \ninvestigator; make any corrections, additions, deletions, or updates necessary to make \nthe summary clear and accurate; or object to the admissibility of Item 4 on the ground \nthat it was not authenticated. Applicant was also notified that if he did not raise any \nobjection to the admissibility of Item 4 in his response to the FORM; or, if he did not \nrespond to the FORM, he could be considered to have waived any such objection, and \nItem 4 could be considered as evidence in his case. \nApplicant raised an objection to Item 4 in his FORM response on the basis that it \nwas not authenticated by a government witness, and that it \u201cis also grossly biased in the \nselection and presentation of information, with many of its claims also being factually \nincorrect.\u201d He did not specify the facts that were inconsistent with the information \ndiscussed with the investigator during the interview, but stated that \u201cMy own Statement \nof Reasons Response more accurately summarizes what actually occurred.\u201d The \nGovernment did not object to Applicant\u2019s FORM response or otherwise oppose \nApplicant\u2019s objection to the admission of Item 4. Accordingly, Applicant\u2019s objection to Item \n4 is sustained and it will not be considered as evidence in his case. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 40, was divorced from his wife of nearly 14 years in 2018.

(Items 2, \n5) \nThe CBR reflected that a debt belonging to Applicant, as an individual account, \nwas assigned to a collection company on behalf of a health insurance company in about \nJanuary 2019. The balance owed as of April 2021 was $267,064. Included in the debt\u2019s \nCBR entry was the following notation: \u201caccount information disputed by consumer.\u201d There \nwas no indication in the record that any of the information reported on this CBR was ever \ninvalidated by either the credit bureau agency, the collection company, or the original \ncreditor. (Item 5) \nOn his SCA, Applicant answered \u201cyes\u201d to whether, in the last seven years, he had \nany bills or debts turned over to a collection agency and disclosed a debt, in the amount \napproximate amount of $274,000 from approximately June 2013, that a health insurance \ncompany claimed he owed. He disputed the debt on the basis that it was an \u201caccounting \nmistake on the part of the insurance company.\u201d With respect to actions he took to resolve \nthe dispute, he explained: \nI spent six months trying to clear up the issue (I still have the original voided \ncheck), and after two years the account was audited and the check was \nreissued. I paid the health providers, and sat on the rest for over a year in \ncase they wanted it back. Three years later (five years after the initial \nmistake), they decided to come after me for it; and \nI proved to [the health insurance company] that they had no legal claim, so \nthey sold the debt. I believe it was then sold again. I\u2019ve continued to dispute \nthis, and asked to go to court if they believe they have a case, but they just \ncontinue to trash my credit without even contacting me. So, at this point (it\u2019s \nbeen nearly seven years), I\u2019m simply waiting for it to fall off my credit report. \n(Item 3) \nIn his SOR answer, Applicant reiterated his dispute of the debt and further \nelaborated on underlying the facts and circumstances. The record did not expressly \nconfirm the reason the insurance company issued the check to Applicant. However, given \nthe information provided by Applicant in his SOR answer and in his FORM response, it is \nreasonable to conclude that the check was issued for Applicant to reimburse one single \nmedical provider for services rendered. (Item 2; FORM response) \nWhile Applicant acknowledged that the insurance company obviously made a \nmistake in sending him such a \u201clarge check,\u201d he believed that he should be absolved of \nthe responsibility for repaying the debt because he made a \u201c[more than] reasonable effort \nto correct their mistake\u201d over the course of a number of years. He tried to resolve the \nissue immediately upon receipt of the erroneous check by making regular calls to the \ninsurance company. At some point, the insurance company told him that they would send \nhim a new check and he agreed not to cash or deposit the original check (Conversation \n1). However, the new check never arrived and \u201cafter six months of trying,\u201d he \u201csimply gave \nup.\u201d (Item 2) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTwo years later, Applicant was contacted by an auditor for the insurance company, \nto whom he explained the situation (Conversation 2). The auditor told him that they would \nsend a new check in the correct amount. When Applicant received the new check, to his \n\u201csurprise,\u201d it was in the same amount as the first check. At that point, he decided to deposit \nthe new check into a new account that was \u201cseparate from [his] personal funds,\u201d and pay \noff \u201cthe medical bills.\u201d He did not provide details about \u201cthe medical bills\u201d he paid from the \nnew check in his SOR answer. However, in his FORM response, he clarified that he paid \n$30,000 from the new check to a single medical provider for expenses associated with \nthe services reimbursed by the new check as well as some other services for which he \nhad not received a reimbursement check. He then contacted the insurance company to \nfigure out how and where to send the remainder to them. Although he never heard back \nfrom them, he left the remaining funds in the new account, assuming that they would want \nit back eventually. He asserted: \u201cAfter paying my medical debts, I would have gladly sent \nthe remainder of the money back (as I attempted to), had I known who and where to send \nit to;\u201d and \u201cHaving witnessed years of gross incompetence at [the insurance company], it \nwould have been foolish to simply drop a check in the mail and hope it finds its way to the \nappropriate account.\u201d (Item 2; FORM response) \nAnother year passed before Applicant decided, \u201cwith much hesitation and \nconsideration,\u201d to use some of the remaining funds for the down-payment on a new home. \nHe concluded that the insurance company had \u201clikely simply written off their mistake,\u201d \nbecause it had been over three years since he received the initial check and over a year \nsince he received the new check. He reasoned that, if the insurance company were to \nlater ask him for the funds, he could always take a home equity line of credit against the \nhome to repay it. (Item 2). \nAs more time passed, Applicant and his wife spent \u201cmuch of the remaining money\u201d \nand then \u201cthe last bit of it was finally wiped out as a result of [their] divorce.\u201d Applicant did \nnot detail how the remaining funds were spent by him and his wife except insofar as he \nreferenced the purchase of a 1936 Ford in September 2016. However, he indicated that, \nat some point during their divorce, the funds were split between them. While his half was \nconsumed during the course of their divorce proceedings, which spanned from June 2017 \nthrough July 2018, he asserted: \u201cHow or when my ex-wife spent her half is unknown.\u201d In \nhis FORM response, Applicant acknowledged that, while the purchase of a 1936 Ford in \nSeptember 2016 may have been \u201cextravagant,\u201d it was not indicative of his spending \nhabits. It was gifted to his father-in-law (FIL) for whom it had sentimental value because \nit had previously belonged to his FIL\u2019s brother. He purchased the vehicle from his FIL\u2019s \nsister-in-law upon his FIL\u2019s brother\u2019s passing. The record did not indicate the purchase \nprice of the vehicle. (Item 2) \nThe insurance company did not contact Applicant again until four years after the \nsecond check was issued, which was six years after the first check was issued \n(Conversation 3). At that point, Applicant averred that he was not in a position to return \nthe remaining funds back to the insurance company. He attributed that position to the \nfollowing: 1) he no longer had the house from which he could pull equity; 2) he had \u201ca \ngreat deal of credit[-]card debt from divorce lawyers and furnishing [his] children\u2019s \nbedrooms\u201d (because his ex-wife \u201ckept everything\u201d); and 3) any remaining funds were \u201csplit \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nup in the divorce.\u201d He maintained: \u201cas much as I would have liked to have repaid [the \ninsurance company] at that time, I simply couldn\u2019t;\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s unreasonable to expect me \nto have held onto that money forever.\u201d (Item 2) \nDuring Conversation 3, Applicant explained \u201call of this\u201d to the insurance company. \nHe also apologized that he was no longer in a position to repay the money, and \u201cinvited \nthem to discuss the case further in court if they felt [he] was still obligated to repay.\u201d He \nasserted: \u201cthey instead handed it off to collections.\u201d He might \u201chave shared the same with \nsomebody from the collections company at that time,\u201d but could not recall. He then \naverred: \u201cIn any case, I haven\u2019t heard from them since.\u201d He did not indicate to whom \n\u201cthem\u201d referred or to the what time \u201csince\u201d referred. (Item 2) \nApplicant also relied on the statute of limitations to support his position that he \nshould no longer be held responsible for repaying the insurance company or the collection \ncompany. In his SOR answer, he argued that the reason he had not heard from \u201cthem \nsince\u201d was \u201cbecause this \u2018debt\u2019 is long past the statute of limitations for collection (it\u2019s now \nbeen nearly seven years since the second check, and nine years since the first.). In fact, \nthe collection is even scheduled to fall off my credit reports in just a few months.\u201d And, in \nhis FORM response, he argued: \nHaving not heard back from them after receiving the new check, the only \nlogical conclusion is that somebody at [the insurance company] was trying \nto hide their mistake. Whatever the case though, expecting me to still be \nsitting on that money four years later is unreasonable (which is why statutes \nof limitation exist). Nonetheless, if I were still in a position to pay back that \nmoney, I would have. Unfortunately, though, my divorce made that \nimpossible. It\u2019s unreasonable to expect me to spend the foreseeable future \nin financial distress to repay a mistake that [the insurance company] wrote \noff years ago, and the collection company has made no effort to collect. \n(Item 2; FORM response) \nApplicant has over 20 years of experience and expertise in software development. \nHe loves the United States, and prides himself on living by the high standards of his \nstrongly-held Christian beliefs. He maintained that he has \u201cno actual debt,\u201d nor does he \ngamble, have mental health issues, use drugs, or drink. With respect to debt alleged in \nthe SOR, he asserted: \u201cI can, with good conscience, say that I did everything I could do \n[to do] what was right in that situation.\u201d (Item 2) \nIn neither his SOR answer nor in his FORM response did Applicant proffer any \ndocuments corroborating his efforts to resolve the debt or his position that he is no longer \nliable for repaying the debt. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012)) \nThe record evidence establishes the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: AG \u00b6 19 (a) (inability to satisfy debts); AG \u00b6 19 (b) (unwillingness to satisfy \ndebts regardless of the ability to do so); and AG \u00b6 19(c) (a history of not meeting financial \nobligations). Having considered all of the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate \nthe concern under this guideline, I find the following relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nThe Government presented a prima facie case for disqualification under Guideline \nF. Accordingly, it was incumbent on Applicant to present sufficient reliable information on \nwhich application of available mitigating conditions could be based. He did not do so. \nAlthough Applicant raised the potential applicability of the mitigating conditions cited \nabove, he produced no documentation or other corroborating information to support any \nof the cited mitigating conditions. I considered the understandable frustration Appellant \nexperienced while making numerous attempts to return the remaining funds, which \nweighs in his favor. However, he not only failed to meet his burden of persuasion to \novercome the Government\u2019s case for disqualification, but he used funds to which he knew \nhe had no legal right. Accordingly, I find that Applicant has not mitigated the Guideline F \nconcerns. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), (b), (d), and (e) are not established.  \nI also want to address Applicant\u2019s statute of limitations assertion. While relying on \nthe statute of limitations could be a legally permissible option for him to avoid repaying \nhis debt, it raises a concern with respect to his security worthiness. As an individual \nseeking to obtain the benefit of a privilege and not a right, he is held to a higher standard \nfor actions that might otherwise be considered innocuous in other contexts. Applicant \nmade a choice to protect his self-interest above his legal obligations. I am, therefore, left \nwith doubt as to whether he may also act similarly with respect to his security obligations. \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised \nby his unresolved debt. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden of showing that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant him eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant or continue Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 31-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security clearance. She has a job as a publications coordinator with a company in the defense industry. She has been so employed since March 2019. Before that, she had full-time employment as a customer service representative during 2014-2019. She has also had short-term part-time jobs (e.g., cashier, crew member) during 2014 and 2017. Her educational background includes attendance at a state university during 2009-2011 and at a community college during 2012. Neither resulted in a degree or certificate. She has never married. She has two minor children. The SOR concerns a history of financial problems, which includes noncompliance with federal and state income tax obligations. The SOR alleged, and Applicant admitted, failure to file, as required, federal and state income tax returns for multiple tax years; namely, 2015 through 2020. The SOR also alleged, and Applicant admitted, 12 delinquent debts in the total amount of about $15,860. The indebtedness consists of two federal student loans in collection (although likely now in deferment due to the ongoing pandemic), three charged-off consumer accounts, two consumer accounts in collection, and five medical collection accounts.

She did not present \nsufficient documentary evidence to mitigate her history of financial problems. \nAccordingly, this case is decided against Applicant. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \nin July 2020. (Exhibit 4) The automated version of the SF 86 is the e-QIP.

Here, the SOR \ndetailed the factual reasons for the action under the security guideline known as \nGuideline F for financial considerations. \nApplicant answered the SOR about three months later in December 2021.2 She \nadmitted all the factual allegations in the SOR without further explanation. She did not \nprovide supporting documentation. She also stated that she wished to have an \nadministrative judge issue a decision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nOn January 18, 2022, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material \n(FORM). It consists of Department Counsel\u2019s written brief and supporting \ndocumentation. The FORM was mailed to Applicant, who received it January 25, 2022. \nShe did not reply to the FORM. The case was assigned to me March 22, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee who is seeking to obtain a security \nclearance. She has a job as a publications coordinator with a company in the defense \nindustry. She has been so employed since March 2019. Before that, she had full-time \nemployment as a customer service representative during 2014-2019. She has also had \nshort-term part-time jobs (e.g., cashier, crew member) during 2014 and 2017. Her \neducational background includes attendance at a state university during 2009-2011 and \nat a community college during 2012. Neither resulted in a degree or certificate. She has \nnever married. She has two minor children. \nThe SOR concerns a history of financial problems, which includes \nnoncompliance with federal and state income tax obligations. The SOR alleged, and \nApplicant admitted, failure to file, as required, federal and state income tax returns for \nmultiple tax years; namely, 2015 through 2020. The SOR also alleged, and Applicant \nadmitted, 12 delinquent debts in the total amount of about $15,860. The indebtedness \nconsists of two federal student loans in collection (although likely now in deferment due \nto the ongoing pandemic), three charged-off consumer accounts, two consumer \naccounts in collection, and five medical collection accounts. In addition to her \nadmissions, these matters are established by disclosures in her SF 86 as well as credit \nreports from 2020 and 2021. (Exhibits 4, 5, and 6) \n2 An applicant\u2019s answer must be received by DOHA within 20 days of receipt of the SOR, and if not, \nprocessing of the case may be discontinued.

(Exhibit 7) But she has not provided \ndocumentation to verify and corroborate those statements. Nor has she provided \ndocumentary proof that she is now in compliance and good standing with federal and \nstate tax authorities by filing her past-due tax returns for multiple tax years. Likewise, \nshe has not provided documentary proof that any of the 12 delinquent debts were paid, \nsettled, in a repayment agreement, disputed, cancelled, forgiven, or otherwise resolved. \nLaw and Policies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.3 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d4 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.5 \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has followed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s \nfindings of fact are reviewed under the substantial-evidence standard.6 Substantial \nevidence means \u201cevidence that a reasonable mind could accept as adequate to support \na conclusion; evidence beyond a scintilla.\u201d7 Substantial evidence is a lesser burden than \nboth clear and convincing evidence and preponderance of the evidence, the latter of \nwhich is the standard applied in most civil trials. It is also a far lesser burden than \nevidence beyond a reasonable doubt, the norm for criminal trials. \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.8 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \n3 Department of the Navy v.

The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . .. \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions as most pertinent: \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; \nAG \u00b6 19(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income \ntax as required; \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. The \ndisqualifying conditions noted above apply here. \n9 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn addressing this issue, I note that an applicant\u2019s failure to timely file tax returns \nand pay tax when due bears close examination and is a matter of serious concern to the \nfederal government. The DOHA Appeal Board has made it clear that an applicant who \nfails repeatedly to fulfill their legal obligations, such as filing tax returns and paying tax \nwhen due, does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and reliability \nrequired of those granted access to classified information. See ISCR Case No. 15-\n06707 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 15, 2017).  \nTo her credit, Applicant disclosed her income-tax problems and other financial \nproblems in her 2020 security clearance application, and she provided information \nduring the background investigation. But the evidence does not support a conclusion \nthat she has engaged in sufficient remedial efforts. Indeed, she has not presented any \ndocumentary evidence in support of her case. She is still in noncompliance with federal \nand state tax authorities, and her 12 delinquent accounts remain unresolved. The \nmitigating conditions noted above do not apply here. \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that she \nhas not met her ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information.  \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.n:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information. National security eligibility is denied. \nMichael H. Leonard \nAdministrative Judge \n5 \n",

While he was working overseas, he and his wife did not file federal or state \nincome tax returns. \nWe were under the impression since we were Expats living and working \noverseas, we had up to seven years before we had to submit our income \ntax. We also had a family member who received a diagnose (sic) of cancer \nwhich became terminal. Because of our misunderstanding of the tax codes \nand family issues, we did not focus on filing our taxes. We have retained \nthe serves (sic) of [TaxService] to represent us before the IRS. They have \nmade contact with the IRS on our behalf. Because we contacted the IRS \nfirst, they are working with us so we can get back in good standing with \nthem. None of our assets have been or will be frozen or seized. Mr. [C] from \n[TaxService] is our Power of Attorney within the IRS Records. (Item 4 at 51-\n54)  \nApplicant completed a SCA in September 2020, and he was asked to disclose his \ntax history dating back seven years. He admitted the information above regarding TY \n2013 through 2019. Although he was living overseas, for at least part of TY 2011 and all \nof TY 2012, it is unknown from the record evidence if he failed to file his tax returns for \nTY 2011 and 2012 in a timely manner, and these TYs are not alleged. Additionally, it \nappears from the documentation that he did not file TY 2020 in a timely manner, and he \nowes the IRS for this TY as well, however, this TY is not alleged. None of the unalleged \nTY will not be considered as disqualifying.

During his November \n2020 interview, he told the investigator that he had filed all of his income tax returns two \nweeks earlier. At that time, he did not know what he owed, as he was waiting for Tax \nService to work with the IRS to determine what he and his wife owed. He told the \ninvestigator that he was not purposefully not paying his taxes, he was just confused and \noverwhelmed by the process. In his March 2021 interrogatories, he further clarified that \nhe and his wife lost four siblings and his wife had a nervous breakdown, attempted \nsuicide, was hospitalized, and was diagnosed with major depression disorder, all of which \ncontributed to his inability to file his tax returns.

In \nhis August 2021 response to interrogatories, he admitted that he owes the IRS $133,196 \nand SDOR $32,238, and at that time, he did not have an installment agreement with either \nentity.

His checking \naccount is going to be auto-drafted $1,129.90 monthly for 60 months. In January 2022, \nhis total outstanding debt to SDOR was $67,793.83. The payments were to start after he \nsubmitted his response to the FORM; therefore, there is no proof of payments in the \nrecord. Nor did he provide a budget to demonstrate his ability to make these payments. \n(AE C) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.  \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under Guideline F (Financial considerations) is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nThe record evidence of Applicant\u2019s delinquent taxes and failure to file his income \ntax returns in a timely manner establishes the following disqualifying conditions under AG \n\u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nAG \u00b6 20 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem form a legitimate and credible, source such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant and his wife were under the mistaken belief that they were not required \nto file their federal and state income tax returns while they were living overseas. It is \nunclear from the record how or when they formed this belief. Additionally, they moved \noverseas in 2011, and it is unknown if they failed to file their federal and state tax returns \nfor TY 2011 and 2012 in a timely manner, as Applicant\u2019s 2020 SCA only asked him to \nreport the previous seven years. It appears from the documentation that he did not file TY \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n2020 in a timely manner and owes an unknown amount to the IRS for this TY, \ndemonstrating that this behavior is recent. According to Applicant, his various personal \nissues related to his son\u2019s cancer, his wife\u2019s medical problems, and the death of their four \nsiblings also contributed to their failure to file their federal and state income tax returns. \nHowever, he failed to demonstrate that he acted reasonably under these circumstances \nto address his tax issues. \nDuring the summer of 2020, Applicant hired Tax Service to help him navigate his \nunfiled and unpaid federal and state income taxes. On October 5, 2020, he signed federal \nincome tax returns for TY 2014, 2016, 2017, and 2019. He signed a return for TY 2015 \non February 22, 2021. He did submit a signature page for TY 2018, and has admitted that \nhe has not filed federal or state income tax returns for 2013. He filed his state income tax \nreturns for TY 2014 through 2019 on February 9, 2021. \nAccording to Tax Service, as of the date of Applicant\u2019s response to the FORM, the \nIRS had not assessed his returns for TY 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2020, and they failed to \nprovide an updated balance for the years that have been assessed, TY 2013, 2014, 2018 \nand 2019. According to the IRS document submitted by Applicant in his August 2021 \nresponse to interrogatories, his outstanding balance for TY 2019 was $22,265.69, rather \nthan the $17,864, he claimed he owed. According to Applicant he owes the IRS $133,196, \nbut he has failed to provide documentation from the IRS to substantiate this amount. The \nupdated TY 2019 documentation, indicates that this total amount could be significantly \ngreater. At this time, he does not have payment agreement in place with the IRS, nor has \nhe made any payments to the IRS in the past five years. There is some evidence of \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 20 (c); however, there is insufficient evidence in the record that \nApplicant\u2019s tax issues are under control or being resolved. \n \nApplicant maintained in his August 2021 response to interrogatories that he owed \nSDOR $32,238. However, the notice of collection letters and the payment agreement \ndemonstrate that his outstanding balance is actually $67,793.83. Starting in February \n2022, his checking account is going to be auto-drafted $1,129.90 monthly. However, he \ndid not provide a budget to demonstrate that he has the ability to make these payments, \nnor has he provided proof of any payments. There is a lack of evidence in the record to \ndemonstrate that he is incompliance with the payment agreement to mitigate this \nallegation. Additionally, if I accept that he is in compliance, and has made his February, \nMarch, and April payments, three payments are insufficient to demonstrate a track-record \nof compliance to mitigate the underlying concerns. \nRegarding the failure to file tax returns, the DOHA Appeal Board has commented: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016) (emphasis in original). See ISCR \nCase No. 15-01031 at 4 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (citations omitted); ISCR Case No. 14-\n05476 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 25, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. \n20, 2002)); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 4-5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). The Appeal Board \nclarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [his or her] \nfederal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated to prevent such \nproblems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant\u2019s security \nworthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility\u201d \nincluding a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 \nat 3 & n.3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d approach to an \napplicant\u2019s course of conduct and employing an \u201call\u2019s well that ends well\u201d analysis as \ninadequate to support approval of access to classified information with focus on timing of \nfiling of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-01031 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board explained \nthat in some situations, even if no taxes are owed when tax returns are not timely filed, \ngrant of access to classified information is inappropriate. In ISCR Case No. 15-1031 (App. \nBd. June 15, 2016) the applicant filed his 2011 federal income tax return in December \n2013, his 2012 federal tax return in September 2014, and his 2013 federal tax return in \nOctober 2015. He received federal tax refunds of at least $1,000 for each year. \nNevertheless, the Appeal Board reversed the administrative judge\u2019s decision to grant \naccess to classified information. \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) the Appeal Board \nreversed the grant of a security clearance, discussed how AG \u00b6 20(g) applied, and noted: \nThe timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who \nbegins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that \nhis clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat \nto his own interests. In this case, applicant\u2019s filing of his Federal income tax \nreturns for 2009-2014 after submitting his SCA, undergoing his background \ninterview, or receiving the SOR undercuts the weight such remedial action \nmight otherwise merit. \nIn this case, Applicant has yet to file his TY 2013 federal and state income tax \nreturns. He owes over $200,000 collectively to the IRS and SDOR and has made minimal \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \npayments toward his debt. Mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), 20(d), and 20(g) \nwas not established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered Applicant\u2019s \nlengthy career in the Army and as a Defense contractor and the potentially disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I \nconclude Applicant has not met his burden of proof and persuasion. He did not mitigate \nthe financial considerations security concerns or establish his eligibility for a security \nclearance. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d:   \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of \nthe United States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to \nclassified information. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nCAROLINE E. HEINTZELMAN \nAdministrative Judge \n10 \n",

(Tr. 19-21; GE 1, 2) \nIn the SOR, the Government alleged Applicant\u2019s six delinquent debts totaling \napproximately $72,000. These delinquencies consisted of two home-improvement loans \n(SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.e), three credit cards (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d), and a local tax debt \n(SOR \u00b6 1.f). Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations with additional comment. His \nadmissions are adopted as findings of fact. (Answer; GE 1-6, 9) \nApplicant attributed his financial issues to his 2017 separation and resulting \ndivorce in 2020. He claimed that when he separated from his ex-spouse, he was sending \nher money in order to pay for marital debts, including some of the SOR debts. He claimed \nthat she was taking this money, but not using it to pay for the debts. He claimed that he \nwas responsible for the SOR debts through the divorce. He did not provide documentary \nevidence of a separation agreement or a divorce decree to corroborate the assignment \nof marital debts. He earns about $90,000 annually. He earns $32 per hour, and $48 per \nhour for overtime. He pays between $1,000 and $1,060 per month for his mortgage. He \nowns a working farm, but does not derive a regular income from it. He has about $1,000 \nin his savings account. (Tr. 18, 22-23, 27, 30-31, 34-36, 40; Answer; GE 1, 2) \nIn about 2019, he paid between $2,000 and $2,500 in cash for a hay cutter. In \nabout 2020, he paid about $7,000 in cash for a hay baler. In April 2022, he bought a \ntractor. He paid $1,000 in cash towards the tractor and makes monthly payments of $550. \nThe purchase price of the tractor was about $38,000. (Tr. 37-39) \nThe $46,920 home-improvement loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a has not been resolved. \nApplicant opened this account in February 2016 to purchase solar panels for the marital \nhome. The last payment he made on this account was in about May 2018. He claimed \nthat he was providing money to his ex-spouse to pay this debt but she was not paying it. \nHe learned that the debt was not being paid in 2020. About six to eight months prior to \nthe hearing, he contacted the creditor about making a payment arrangement, but he was \nunable to make one. (Tr. 21-25; Answer; GE 2, 4-6, 9) \nThe $5,411 credit card alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b is being resolved. He became \ndelinquent on this debt because he lost track of it, and he was not sure who would be \nresponsible for it given his divorce. He claimed that he made a payment arrangement with \nthe creditor after the SOR was issued and made payments of about $56 per month that \nautomatically came out of his bank account. As of the hearing date, he claimed the \nbalance on this account was about $4,600. The November 2021 credit report reflects a \npayment of $57.

He claimed that he was providing money to his ex-spouse to pay this \ndebt, but she was not paying it. He has not made any payment arrangements or payments \non this debt after it became delinquent. (Tr. 26-28; Answer; GE 2, 5, 6, 9) \nThe $2,273 credit card alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.d is being resolved. Applicant used this \ncredit card for every day expenses. He opened the account in 2002, and he last made a \npayment on it in 2019. He claimed that he was providing money to his ex-spouse to pay \nthis debt but she was not paying it. He claimed that he made a payment arrangement with \nthe creditor in 2020 after the creditor contacted him. He claimed he made payments of \nabout $56 per month since then, but he provided no documentation to corroborate these \npayments or the payment arrangement. (Tr. 28-29; Answer; GE 2, 4-6, 9) \nThe $14,734 home improvement loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.e has not been resolved. \nApplicant borrowed this money in 2016 to put a new roof on the marital residence. The \nlast payment Applicant made on this account was in about February 2018. He claimed \nthat he was providing money to his ex-spouse to pay this debt, but she was not paying it. \nHe learned that the debt was not being paid in 2020. He has not made any payment \narrangements or payments on this debt after it became delinquent. (Tr. 29-31; Answer; \nGE 2, 4) \nThe $83 local tax debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f has been resolved. Applicant claimed \nthat after the SOR was issued, he went to the tax office and paid this debt in person on \nan undisclosed date. He claimed he was not aware he owed this tax until the SOR was \nissued. (Tr. 31-32; GE 3) \nIn about 2018, Applicant\u2019s marital residence was foreclosed upon and sold at \nauction. Applicant claimed that he was providing funds for his ex-spouse to pay the \nmortgage on this home, but she was not doing so. He claimed that he found out about \nthe delinquency when the account was about five months past due and that he tried to \nwork with the creditor to avoid foreclosure, but was unable to do so. The sale of the marital \nresidence satisfied the mortgage. (Tr. 23-24; GE 1, 2, 7) \nThe IRS entered a $166,000 tax lien against Applicant in 2011 for failure to pay \nincome taxes. In 2012, he resolved the tax issue and the aforementioned tax lien was \nreleased. Applicant claimed that he is current on all of his tax obligations. Any adverse \ninformation not alleged in the SOR, such as Applicant\u2019s foreclosure and his tax lien, \ncannot be used for disqualification purposes. It may be considered when assessing the \napplication of mitigating conditions and for the whole-person analysis.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a significant amount of delinquent debt that has been unresolved for \nseveral years. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c), thereby shifting \nthe burden to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nApplicant satisfied the tax debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f through payment when he realized he \nowed it. I find in favor of Applicant with respect to that allegation. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhile Applicant has resolved the small tax debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f through payment and \nis making minimal payments on two other debts, he has not provided sufficient evidence \nthat the majority of his delinquencies are being resolved. His financial issues are ongoing. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues arose because of a marital separation and divorce. \nThese conditions were beyond his control. However, he must also show that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances with respect to these debts. While he paid the small \ntax debt and has made monthly payments with respect to two of the other SOR debts, his \nmonthly payments are minimal ($56 or $57). Given these minimal payments in relation to \nthe total amount of his delinquent debt, he failed to show he is meaningfully addressing \nhis delinquent debts. Importantly, despite having these unaddressed financial \ndelinquencies, between 2019 and 2022, he spent about $10,000 in cash and further \nindebted himself for farm equipment. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nApplicant resolved a small tax debt and is making minimal monthly payments on \ntwo other debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) is partly applicable, but Applicant has failed to show that he \nhas a payment arrangement or is making payments on the vast majority of his overall \ndelinquencies. \nNone of the mitigating factors are fully applicable. The financial considerations \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated. Applicant\u2019s financial issues continue to cast doubt on \nhis current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance.

(Tr. at 12-20.) \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from his SCA unless otherwise \nindicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings, Applicant\u2019s testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \nApplicant is 23 years old and was born in the United States. He has never married \nand has no children. His parents were born in Egypt, immigrated to the United States, \nand became naturalized U.S. citizens. Both of his parents have earned doctorate degrees \nin the United States. Applicant is a dual U.S.-Egyptian citizen due to his parents\u2019 Egyptian \ncitizenships. Applicant attended college in the United States and earned his bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in August 2020. Since then, he has worked for a U.S. defense contractor as an \nengineer. His employer is sponsoring him for a security clearance. He is a first-time \nclearance applicant. In March 2020, Applicant and two classmates co-founded a \ntechnology business (Business). He works on his start-up venture part time as the \u201cTeam \nLead.\u201d (Tr. at 22, 24-29.) \nApplicant has several aunts, uncles, and cousins who are citizens and residents \nof Egypt. He is closest to one cousin (Cousin) who is 24 years old, has an undergraduate \ndegree in computer science, and is a software engineer. In about September 2020, the \nCousin began assisting the Business by developing a software application for use with \ncertain types of cellphones. Applicant regards his Cousin as a friend as well as a relative. \nThey text frequently about the Cousin\u2019s work on the application and other matters. They \ntalk on the phone weekly. Applicant last visited Egypt in September and October 2021 \nwith his family. He met with his Cousin during that trip. (Tr. at 30-36, 42, 51.) \nSOR Allegation and Applicant\u2019s Answer \nParagraph 1, Guideline B - The SOR sets forth a single allegation regarding the \npotential for foreign influence resulting from Applicant\u2019s relationship with his Cousin, who \nis a citizen and resident of Egypt.

He represented that as of the date of the SOR, his Cousin had finished \nhis mandatory one year of service in the Egyptian army. Accordingly, Applicant denied \nthis part of the SOR allegation. He explained further that the Cousin\u2019s military service is \nfollowed by a mandatory nine-year period in the army reserves. Applicant further \nexplained the role the Cousin has in the Business. The Business is owned by Applicant \nand two of his university classmates. Applicant specifically denied in the Answer that his \ncousin has ever been an owner of the Business or that he ever had any financial ties to \nthe Business. (SOR at 1; Answer at 1.) \nIn the summary of his December 2020 background interview, the investigator wrote \nthat Applicant: \nclaimed that he has partnered with his cousin . . ., a citizen of Egypt, as a \nself-employed start up business in 03/2020. This business was founded by \n[Applicant] and this cousin. (GE 2 at 15-16) \nIn his June 2021 responses to DOHA\u2019s Interrogatories, Applicant affirmed that the \ninvestigator\u2019s report accurately reflected the information he provided during the interview \nwithout any changes. In response to a different interrogatory, Applicant wrote that the \nCousin was \u201cin charge of app development,\u201d that the Cousin \u201cwas not an initial member \nwhen the business was founded,\u201d and that the cousin \u201cjoined the Team a few months \nlater in 2020.\u201d He also wrote that the Cousin \u201cis not currently an owner in the business.\u201d \nHe further noted that \u201cwe do not conduct business outside of the U.S.\u201d (GE 2 at 4-5.) \nAt the hearing, Applicant clarified the role of his Cousin in the Business and \ndiscussed certain misunderstandings due to his prior choice of words. He wanted to \ndescribe the Cousin\u2019s role more accurately. He credibly testified that his Cousin was not \na partner in the Business and that his role was better described as an unpaid intern or \nhelper. The quote above from his background interview in which he is reported as using \nthe word \u201cpartnered\u201d is a misinterpretation of what he told the investigator. Applicant and \nhis two partners considered the Cousin to be part of the \u201cTeam\u201d because he was helping \nthem, but he was not a \u201cfounder\u201d or partner. (Tr. at 22, 32-40, 46-61.) \nApplicant also testified about the origins of the Business. It began as a class project \nin 2017, when Applicant was in college. He and his two classmates submitted their \nclasswork in a competition sponsored by a foundation. Their project won the competition \nand $5,000 of prize money. They formally organized a legal entity for the Business in \nMarch 2020. Applicant and the two classmates are the sole owners of the entity. At the \nearly stages of the Business, Applicant and his co-founders discussed the possibility of \nhaving the Cousin become a part of the Business, but they decided against that because \nit was not practical and was not important to the Cousin. (Tr. at 22, 32-40, 46-61; AE B at \n2, 4.) \nThe Cousin, however, became involved in the Business to a limited extent in \nSeptember 2020. At that time, he was serving on active duty in the Egyptian army.

He was discharged from active duty in the \nEgyptian army in June 2021. He now works full time in the Egyptian office of an \ninternational business as a software developer. He is also pursuing his studies to earn a \nmaster\u2019s degree. (Tr. at 22, 32-35, 38, 40; AE A at 4.) \nThe Cousin\u2019s contributions to the Business on the software application has been \nhis only work for the Business. Applicant has no plans for his Cousin to provide any future \nservices on new projects for the Business. The Cousin was not paid for this work, and he \nhas no expectation of receiving any compensation in the future. The Cousin never asked \nfor anything in return for the help he provided. The Business applied for a patent on the \nBusiness\u2019s product, and the Cousin was not listed as a co-inventor. If the Business \nneeded software expertise and the Cousin was not available to help the Business, \nApplicant and his partners could write the software themselves or hire someone to do it. \n(Tr. at 36-40, 50, 56, 59.) \nAdministrative Notice \nBased upon the official U.S. government documents attached to Department \nCounsel\u2019s Request for Administrative Notice, I take administrative notice of the following \nfacts regarding the country conditions in Egypt: \nAlthough the United States and Egypt have certain strategic ties, Egypt and agents \nacting on behalf of Egypt have engaged in efforts to illegally purchase sophisticated U.S. \nweaponry and to conduct espionage. Terrorist organizations operate in Egypt and attack \nboth Egyptian governmental assets and western assets, including those of the United \nStates. In 2020, terrorist groups claimed responsibility for killing hundreds of civilians \nthroughout the country. There are significant human rights issues in Egypt, including \nunlawful killings, extrajudicial killings by the government or its agents, forced \ndisappearances, torture, life-threatening conditions in prisons, and serious restrictions on \nfree expression, the press, and the Internet. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAdverse clearance determinations must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \nExec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication \nthe applicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1, Guideline B \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6 as follows: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe following potentially disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 7 could apply to the \nfacts of this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; and \n(f) substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign country, \nor in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could subject the \nindividual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation or personal \nconflict of interest. \nThe record evidence establishes that Applicant\u2019s contacts with the Cousin, both as \na foreign family member and as a foreign professional associate, creates a heightened \nrisk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. Also, \nApplicant\u2019s connections to his Cousin create a potential conflict of interest between \nApplicant\u2019s obligation to protect classified or sensitive information or technology and his \ndesire to help his Cousin. The potentially disqualifying conditions set forth in AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) \nand (b) are established. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThe record evidence does not establish that Applicant has a substantial business, \nfinancial, or property interest in Egypt. Also, the Business is not foreign owned or foreign \noperated. It does not operate as a business in Egypt. The fact that a person who provides \nservices for the Business is a citizen and resident of Egypt does not meet the \nrequirements of this potentially disqualifying condition. Moreover, there is no heightened \nrisk of foreign influence or exploitation or personal conflict of interest arising out of the \nownership and operations of the Business as it is structured. All of its owners and \nmanagers are based in the United States as is the Business. Its only connections outside \nthe United States is an unpaid software developer who assisted in creating part of the \nproduct\u2019s software. AG \u00b6 7(f) is not established. \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 8 contains six conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from foreign influence. Three of these mitigating conditions have \npossible applicability to the facts of this case: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and (b) are established. The nature of Applicant\u2019s relationship with the \nCousin is such that it is unlikely that Applicant will be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of the Cousin or the Egyptian Government and the interests \nof the United States. Also, there is no conflict of interest because Applicant\u2019s sense of \nloyalty to the Cousin is minimal. Their relationship is as friends with a common interest in \ndeveloping technologies and as relatives. Moreover, Applicant has deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States. It is the country of his birth, \nand education, and where he has started a business. He has also decided to use his \neducation to work for a U.S. Government contractor supporting the U.S. military. He can \nbe expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. \nAG \u00b6 8(c) is not established. Applicant\u2019s communications with the Cousin are not \ncasual and infrequent. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d), specifically: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation\nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct;\n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the\nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Further comments are warranted. \nApplicant provided credible testimony and evidence that supports a conclusion that \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with the Cousin is different than what he described in his SCA \nand background interview. At the hearing, he described in detail the relatively small role \nthe Cousin played in creating part of the software for the Business. In Applicant\u2019s effort to \nbe fully transparent in his SCA and during his background interview, he failed to properly \ndescribe the actual role of the Cousin in the Business. Overall, the record evidence as \ndescribed above leaves me without questions or doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and \nsuitability for a security clearance. After weighing the applicable disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions and evaluating all of the evidence in the context of the whole person, \nI conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by potential foreign \ninfluence. \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:   \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interests of the United States \nto grant Applicant national security eligibility for a security clearance.

The SOR alleges under Guideline F that Applicant is indebted on a consumer account in collection and two charged-off consumer accounts totaling $23,054 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.g); and four medical debts in collections totaling $401 (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.f).

During his August 2020 personal subject interview (PSI) with a Government investigator, Applicant discussed the SOR debts. He said the collection account listed as SOR \u00b6 1.a for $10,645 is a defaulted loan for his spouse\u2019s car, and the account listed in SOR \u00b6 1.g for $12,043 may be the same account. Of note, the credit bureau reports in the record show each account with different account numbers and amounts due.

He said the collection account listed as \nSOR \u00b6 1.a for $10,645 is a defaulted loan for his spouse\u2019s car, and the account listed in \nSOR \u00b6 1.g for $12,043 may be the same account. Of note, the credit bureau reports in \nthe record show each account with different account numbers and amounts due. \nApplicant also acknowledged the collection account in SOR \u00b6 1.b for $366 as a delinquent \ncredit-card account, and said he would pay it off. With regard to his medical debts, he \nsaid he would investigate the accounts and pay them if his insurance does not cover \nthem, or dispute them if the insurance company is responsible. Applicant said he would \nreview his credit report and begin payments on the smallest accounts first. \nNo information was provided showing efforts to investigate, pay, dispute, or \notherwise resolve the SOR debts, or on his current financial status. He said in his PSI \nthat he was unaware of the extent of his delinquency history and that it was important for \nhim to clean up his credit. Although he admitted the delinquent accounts were his, he said \nhe was a victim of fraud in the past, and completed credit counseling several years ago. \nHe said he and his spouse allowed their medical bills, secured credit cards, and vehicle \npayments to overwhelm them. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 2.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant is indebted on a consumer account in collection and two charged-off \nconsumer accounts, totaling $23,054, and four medical debts in collection, totaling $401. \nThese accounts are unresolved. The documentary evidence in the record and Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions are sufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and (c). \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially relevant: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nNone of the above mitigating conditions are established. Applicant has a history of \nnot meeting his financial obligations, and he has not shown efforts to address his debts \ndespite a long history of full employment. The guideline encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThere is insufficient evidence to determine that Applicant\u2019s financial problems will \nbe resolved within a reasonable period and that he can obtain and maintain a measure \nof financial responsibility. He claimed to have received credit counseling, but did not \nprovide supporting evidence. He claimed that two SOR allegations were duplicates, but \ndid not provide documentary evidence to support his contention. He presented no \ndocumentary evidence of a significant life circumstance that contributed to his financial \nproblems, and regardless, there is no evidence that he acted in good faith under the \ncircumstances. His financial issues continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. No mitigation credit is applicable. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). I have considered Applicant\u2019s \nemployment history and the type of debts owed, including medical debts and a claimed \nduplicate account. Because he requested a determination on the record without a \nhearing, I had no opportunity to evaluate his credibility and sincerity based on demeanor \nor to question him about the circumstances that led to his debts or any action he may \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nhave taken to address them. See ISCR Case No. 01-12350 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Jul. 23, \n2003). \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person, including exceptions available under Appendix C of SEAD \n4. I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security concerns raised by his financial \ndelinquencies. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): AGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.

As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to Guideline F for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n                               \n \n \n \n \n  \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nGuideline F notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe SOR debts are established by Applicant\u2019s admissions and the \nGovernment\u2019s credit reports. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nGuideline F also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies occurred recently and persist to this day. I cannot find \nthat AG \u00b6 20(a) applies. The next inquiry is whether AG \u00b6 20(b) applies.  \nApplicant developed medical conditions requiring surgeries in 2018, during the \nperiod of his employment. Not all of his medical costs were covered by his medical \ninsurance. Applicant went on short-term disability, which caused a 40% loss of pay. His \nfinancial defaults between 2019 and 2021 which arose from his medical conditions and \nthe resultant pay cut are conditions recognized by AG \u00b6 20(b) as being \u201clargely beyond \n[a] person\u2019s control.\u201d The inquiry, however, does not end there. Faced with medical and \nfinancial adversity, Applicant needs to show that he acted responsibly under those \ncircumstances.  When Applicant was interviewed, he was unaware that some of his \naccounts were in default. This caused his post-SOR (7/1/2021) delay in addressing them. \nOn December 3, 2021, Applicant enrolled six of his SOR debts in a debt consolidation \nagency to help him resolve his debts. He has made 10 payments to that agency from \nJanuary 2022 to April 2022. Applicant\u2019s 10 payments totaled $4,278. Applicant acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances. I find that AG \u00b6 20(b) applies, and Applicant has \nmitigated SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.e. and 1.g. He also mitigated SOR \u00b6 1.h., which was not \nhis account.  \nI have also considered AG \u00b6 20(d). The facts and analysis discussed under AG \u00b6 \n20(b) apply equally here. Applicant initiated a good-faith effort to repay his SOR debts. \nAnd his 10 payments made from January 2022 to April 2022 show a track record towards \nresolving those debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies. \nAs to SOR \u00b6 1.f., Applicant made good-faith efforts to contact the successor \ncollection agency to discuss his account. He was unsuccessful. \u201cThe law does not require \nthe doing of a futile act.\u201d Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56 (1980). The amount of that debt \n($4,235) does not raise national security concerns. I find that Applicant has mitigated this \ndebt. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) \n(explaining the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). In my analysis above, I considered \nthe potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in \nlight of all the facts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant does not leave me with questions about his eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For these reasons, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \n         FOR APPLICANT \n \n \n      Subparagraphs 1.a.- 1.h.:  \n                            For Applicant  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 47-year-old whose employment with a defense contractor is contingent upon obtaining a security clearance. He has worked for an employer that does not require that he hold a security clearance since about July 2020. From approximately 2007 until about July 2019, he alternated between being self-employed and working for government contractors in the information technology (IT) field. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1999. He was married from August 2016 until April 2022, when he finalized his divorce. However, he has lived separate and apart from his ex- spouse beginning in about 2019. He has a former stepson who is 20-years-old and two daughters who are 25 and 17 years old. His youngest daughter lives with Applicant and he is financially responsible for her. He provides financial support as needed for his adult child. He was awarded a position of public trust in 2007.

(Tr. 50; Response to SOR; GE 2, 3) \nApplicant claimed that he disputed the medical debts listed in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and \n1.h because he had medical insurance through his employer. The debts were incurred \nas a result of a hand injury A\n pplicant suffered in 2017. Applicant claimed he sent a letter \ndisputing these debts to the medical provider and believes that he received a letter from \nthe provider acknowledging that he no longer owed the debts. Applicant did not provide \nany documentation to corroborate that he disputed the debt. He also did not provide any \ndocumentation showing that his dispute of the debt had been resolved in his favor or \nthat it is no longer owed. These debts appear on the 2019 credit report but not on the \n2020 or 2021 credit reports. (Tr. 51-52; Response to SOR; GE 3) \nIn about 2001, Applicant filed a petition in Chapter 7 Bankruptcy and received a \ndischarge. Applicant purchased a home about 22 years ago. In 2006 or 2007, he \ndeeded the home to his parents in order to avoid it being foreclosed upon. Despite living \nin another home, Applicant\u2019s parents pay the approximately $1,267 mortgage each \nmonth. Applicant pays his parents about $700 each month to go towards that mortgage. \nHe lost his job in approximately July 2019 and claims that loss of employment caused \nhis current financial difficulties. Applicant earns about $46,000 per year at his current \njob. He would make more money if he worked for the government contractor that \nrequires him to hold a security clearance. (Tr. 25-33; GE 1, 2) \nApplicant has a significant history of criminal offenses, including drug-related \noffenses. In about September 2018, he was charged with second degree child abuse \nand assault in State A after a physical altercation with his then 15-year-old stepson. \nApplicant claims that he got in his stepson\u2019s face and grabbed his stepson by the shirt \ncollar after hearing his stepson cursing.

Applicant claimed there was no physical contact between him and the \nalleged victim, but that he was upset and continued to \u201cmouth off,\u201d after the police \narrived, so he was arrested. He claimed that the charges against him were dropped and \nthat the alleged victim did not press charges. Throughout the clearance investigative \nprocess, and until after significant cross-examination, Applicant consistently confused \nthis arrest with his 2018 arrest. (Tr. 60-65; GE 2, 6) \nIn about March 2011, Applicant was arrested and charged with felony possession \nof a dangerous controlled substance with intent to distribute in State A. He was \nconvicted of this crime. Stemming from the same arrest, he was also charged with two \nother misdemeanors relating to drug possession, but the prosecutor moved to nolle \nprosequi these misdemeanor charges and they were dismissed. Applicant received a \nsentence of five years in jail with four years, nine months and ten days suspended, and \nthree years of probation. He has complied with all of the terms of this conviction. (Tr. 65-\n67; Response to SOR; GE 1, 2, 6) \nIn about April 2011, Applicant was indicted on two criminal counts in federal \ndistrict court. The first count was conspiracy to commit theft of government property, a \nfelony. The second count was theft of government property, also a felony. In about 2009 \nand 2010, Applicant and an associate were selling stolen U.S. Government computers \nthat Applicant claims were no longer in use. Applicant claims that his role in this scheme \nwas to make sure the computers were clean and then re-install software on them. He \nalso received some of the profits from the sale of these stolen computers. Applicant \npleaded guilty to count one of the indictment, while count two was dismissed. He was \nsentenced to two months in prison and was on supervised release for two years. He has \ncomplied with all of the terms of this conviction. (Tr. 72-76; Response to SOR; GE 2, 7) \nIn April 2005, Applicant was arrested and charged with misdemeanor carrying a \nconcealed weapon in State C. Applicant claims that he had a gun in his car because he \nhad been shooting at a gun range the day before the arrest. The police found the gun \nwhen they pulled him over for a moving violation. Applicant was convicted and received \na 90-day suspended sentence, which he completed without incident. (Tr. 76-77; GE 1, \n2, 6; AE 3) \nIn November 1997, Applicant was arrested in State D for having marijuana in his \ncar and charged with felony maintaining a vehicle for keeping controlled substances. \nThis charge was dismissed. He was also charged with felony possession with intent to \ndistribute a nonnarcotic schedule I controlled substance.

Both of these charges were dismissed. (Tr. 78-79; Response to SOR; \nGE 2, 6) \nIn February 1995, Applicant was arrested and charged with felony fraud, theft \nover $500 in State D. Applicant was also charged with felony conspiracy and \nmisdemeanor theft under $500. Applicant was allowing merchandise to be stolen from \nhis place of employment without reporting it. He was ultimately found guilty of \nmisdemeanor theft under $500 and misdemeanor agreement to engage in \nmisdemeanor criminal conduct. He was ordered to pay restitution for the property that \nwas stolen.

He used it about two to three times per week during this timeframe. \nApplicant failed to divulge his 2014 through 2019 marijuana usage on his Questionnaire \nfor National Security Positions (SF 86) that he certified in August 2019. He claimed that \nhe failed to divulge this marijuana use because he thought that he only had to report \ndrug use that was \u201charder\u201d than marijuana, and because he did not consider marijuana \nto be illegal. In March and April 2010, Applicant attended and completed pre-trial drug \ncounseling as a condition of one of his drug offenses. (Tr. 67-72, 82-83; GE 1) \nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleged Applicant\u2019s 2016 arrest, his two 2011 \narrests, his 2005 arrest, his two 1997 arrests, and his 1995 and 1994 arrests. Applicant \nadmitted these arrests in his SOR Response, with additional comments. Applicant\u2019s \nGuideline J admissions are adopted as findings of fact.

(Tr. 21-22, 83-85; Response to SOR) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n. \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial delinquencies that includes Federal student \nloans, credit cards, and medical debt. The evidence is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c), thereby shifting the burden to Applicant to provide evidence in mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment;  \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the\npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides\ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides\nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n \n \n \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his loss of a job in July 2019. This \ncause was beyond his control. However, Applicant has had financial issues for much of \nhis adult life, and these problems pre-date his July 2019 loss of employment. For \nexample, Applicant received a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharge in 2001. He also signed \nover the deed to his residence in about 2007 in order to avoid his home being \nforeclosed upon. \nThere is documentary corroboration that the Federal student loans alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b have been rehabilitated through payment and are no longer \ndelinquent. SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b are concluded for Applicant. \nApplicant provided a document showing that he has a payment arrangement and \nbegan making payments of $90 per month to the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.c. However, he \nmade those payment arrangements and payments after the SOR was issued. An \napplicant who begins to resolve security concerns only after having been placed on \nnotice that his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment and willingness to \nfollow rules and regulations when his or her personal interests are not threatened. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04110 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 26, 2019). \nApplicant provided no documentary evidence of payments or favorable resolution \nof the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f. It is reasonable to expect Applicant to present \ndocumentation about the resolution of specific debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-\n03363 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 16, 2016). While Applicant claimed that he sent a dispute \nletter to the creditor for the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e because he did not agree with the \nbalance, he did not provide a copy of this letter. He therefore did not provide \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of his dispute. This failure to provide \ndocumentation of his dispute, his failure to follow-up with the creditor, and his failure to \npresent proof that he contacted the credit reporting agencies means that he did not \nprovide sufficient evidence of his actions to resolve the issue. The debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e \nalso appears on all three of the credit reports in evidence.  \nApplicant stated that he intends to pay the SOR debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.f. However, \nintentions to pay debts in the future are not a substitute for a track record of debt \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nrepayment or other responsible approaches. See ISCR Case No. 11-14570 at 3 (App. \nBd. Oct. 23, 2013). \nApplicant disputed the medical debts contained in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h. because \nhe believed those debts should have been covered by insurance. He claimed that he \ndisputed these debts with the creditor. While he did not provide documentation to \ncorroborate his dispute, these debts do not appear on a credit report in evidence after \nthe September 2019 credit report. There are reasons other than a favorable resolution \nfor debts to no longer appear on a credit report. However, these debts were less than \nseven years old and should not have aged off. I find that the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and \n1.h. are mitigated under AG \u00b6 20(e) because these debts no longer appear on \nsubsequent credit reports, because Applicant claimed that he contacted the creditor, \nand because the basis for his dispute was reasonable.    \nDespite the fact that I have found in his favor on some of the SOR debts, overall, \nI am unwilling to find that Applicant acted responsibly under the circumstances, or that \nhe made a good-faith effort to pay or otherwise resolve several of his SOR debts. His \nfinancial issues are ongoing. His extended history of financial problems detracts from \nhis ability to show that his financial issues are unlikely to recur. His financial issues are \nnot mitigated and they continue to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, \nand good judgment. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern for criminal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about an Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following is potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant has been arrested and charged with criminal offenses at least eight \ntimes in his adult life. Several of these arrests were for felonies, including one for \nstealing from the U.S. Government. The above disqualifying condition is applicable. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment;  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant has been involved in illegal activity for much of his life. One of his \ncrimes involved the theft of government property while he arguably held a position of \npublic trust, proving that he was willing to take advantage of his relationship with the \ngovernment in order to benefit himself. In addition to the arrests listed in his SOR, he \nwas arrested again in 2018 for violent conduct where he admitted he grabbed and \nscratched his then stepson. He also illegally used marijuana until August 2019. For \nthese reasons, I do not believe there has been sufficient evidence of rehabilitation \nthrough the passage of time without recurrence or that Applicant\u2019s criminal behavior is \nunlikely to recur. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for drug involvement and substance misuse is set out in AG \n\u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 25. The following is potentially applicable in this case: \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation,\nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of\ndrug paraphernalia. \n \n \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nApplicant was arrested in 2011 and 1997 for marijuana possession and \nmarijuana possession with an intent to distribute. Marijuana is a controlled substance \nand is illegal under federal law. The above disqualifying condition is applicable. \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. The following \nare potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \n(c) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including, but \nnot limited to rehabilitation and aftercare requirements without recurrence of \nabuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical professional. \nApplicant used and possessed marijuana for over 20 years. His involvement, \nincluding use of two to three times per week, was frequent. His three years of \nabstinence pales in comparison to his period of involvement and detracts from his ability \nto show that his marijuana involvement is unlikely to recur. He has not provided \nevidence that he has changed or avoided the environment where he used marijuana, \nnor has he provided a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement. \nWhile Applicant completed a drug rehabilitation course sometime in 2011, he used \nmarijuana again after completing the course. None of the mitigating conditions are \napplicable, and Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use is not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \n11 \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                       \n \n \n                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                    \n \n \n                                 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have considered \nApplicant\u2019s positive character references. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuidelines F, J, and H in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations, criminal conduct, and drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.f:    \n Against Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.h \n For Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 3, Guideline H:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

On that same date, I proposed \nthat this case was appropriate for a summary disposition in Applicant\u2019s favor. \nDepartment Counsel did not object. \nApplicant self-reported using marijuana one time in 2000, where he also was \ncharged and received a deferred prosecution for possession of marijuana, and several \ntimes between 2012 and October 2018.

Based on the record evidence as a whole, I conclude that the \ntrustworthiness concerns are mitigated under the following mitigating conditions: AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n26(a) and 26(b). \nThe concerns over Applicant\u2019s infrequent marijuana involvement does not create \ndoubt about his current reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nsensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence as a whole \nand considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable evidence.

(Item 3) \nIn Applicant\u2019s February 2021 security clearance application (SCA), he disclosed \nthree delinquent debts. Applicant attributed his financial problems to his unemployment \ndue to his health and his wife passing away in 2016. He stated to the government \ninvestigator during his March 2021 interview that he was laid off from a position in 2015 \nand was supported by a severance package and his wife\u2019s disability until she passed \naway in May 2016.

At some point, Applicant\u2019s health became an issue \nand he had a kidney transplant. The details and timeframe were not provided. He told the \ninvestigator that now that his health was better, his finances were improving. However, \nhe did not intend to repay his debts for repossessed vehicles because they were over five \nyears old. (Items 3, 4) \nDuring Applicant\u2019s background interview by a government investigator, he \nacknowledged owing the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.j ($18,636) for a vehicle he purchased in August \n2015 that was later repossessed in December 2015. He told the investigator that the debt \nshould be charged off and he does not plan on paying it because he returned the vehicle \nover five years ago. This debt is unresolved. (Item 4 pages 7-10) \nIn Applicant\u2019s July 2021 response to interrogatories, he stated: \u201cWorking on a plan \nto have the medical collections paid of[f] in a month (end of Aug 2021).\u201d Medical debts \nare alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b61.c ($482), 1.d ($459), 1.g ($67), and 1.h ($63).

They are unresolved. \n(Item 2, Item 4 pages 3, 7-10, Item 5) \nApplicant acknowledged to the investigator that he owed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i \n($7,195), which was for a personal loan he obtained in 2013 or 2014.

He told the investigator that he planned on contacting the \ncreditor and negotiating a settlement agreement and pay it as soon as he could. In his \nSOR answer he denied the debt stating that it either had been paid in full or had been \nremoved from his credit report. He did not provide any documents to support his claim. \nThe debt is unresolved. (Item 2, Item 4 pages 7-10) \nApplicant acknowledged to the investigator that he owed the debt alleged in SOR \n\u00b6 1.e (collection account for utility bill-$431) for an electric bill that he could not pay when \nhe lost his job in 2015. He intended to pay the bill as soon as possible. In his SOR answer, \nhe denied the debt stating that it either had been paid in full or had been removed from \nhis credit report. He did not provide any documents to support his claim. The debt is \nunresolved. (Item 2, Item 4 pages 7-10) \nApplicant admitted the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.a ($11,795) and acknowledged it to the \ninvestigator. He explained to the investigator that the amount was alleged by a former \nlandlord for damages and because Applicant had not removed all of his property from the \npremises. Applicant disputed the debt and told the investigator that he intended to take \nthe landlord to court. Applicant did not provide any evidence as to his actions to resolve \nor dispute the debt. It remains unresolved. (Item 2, Item 4 pages 7-10) \nApplicant admitted the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b ($1,412). He explained to the investigator \nthat the debt was incurred in 2015 after he lost his job and was sick. He was now \nemployed and intended to pay this debt as soon as possible. He did not provide evidence \nthat the debt was paid or resolved. (Item 2, Item 4) \nApplicant stated that he arranged a settlement agreement with the creditor for the \ndebt in SOR \u00b6 1.f ($78). The supporting documents show that an agreement was reached \nand Applicant paid $701 towards the original amount of $779. It appears the remaining \nbalance alleged in SOR 1.f was the amount the creditor agreed to forgive. In Applicant\u2019s \ninterrogatory response, he stated that he had followed up with the creditor for the debt \nand was told his credit report would be updated regarding it. I find in Applicant\u2019s favor on \nthis allegation. (Item 2, Item 4 at 3-10, 13-17, Item 6) \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in the SOR, interrogatory responses, and background \ninterview, a credit report from March 2021, and a state document verifying a judgment \ncorroborate the SOR allegations. (Items 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handing and safeguarding classified \ninformation. See ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has numerous delinquent debts that began accumulating in about 2014. \nHe was unable to pay them for a period. Some debts, despite his admissions that they \nbelong to him, he does not intend to pay. There is sufficient evidence to support the \napplication of the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant acknowledged to the government investigator and in his SOR answer \nthat he owed the debts alleged in the SOR. He does not intend to pay the repossessed \nvehicle debts because of their age. He indicated that other debts were either paid or no \nlonger on his credit report. He failed to provide corroborating evidence to either. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are numerous and unpaid. His failure to address the debts \ncast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does \nnot apply. \nApplicant did not provide a timeline for his medical conditions. The loss of his wife\u2019s \nincome and her passing were beyond his control. His medical issues were beyond his \ncontrol. For the full application of AG \u00b6 20(b), Applicant must show he acted responsibly \nunder the circumstances. Applicant stated to the government investigator and in his \ninterrogatories his intention to pay his medical bills and address his other delinquent \ndebts, but he did not intend to pay the large debts for the repossessed vehicles. Later, he \nindicated that certain debts were either paid or removed from his credit report. He failed \nto provide corroboration for either. After Applicant was working and able to address his \ndelinquent debts he chose not to. He failed to act responsibly. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nThere is no evidence Applicant is participating in credit counseling. AG \u00b6 20(c) \ndoes not apply. He resolved the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to it. There is \ninsufficient evidence to apply it to his other debts. Applicant disputes the debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.a, but failed to provide documented proof to substantiate any action he has taken. AG \n\u00b6 20(e) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nThe Appeal Board provides a summary regarding \u201cnon-collectable\u201d debts: \nThe security significance of long delinquent debts is not diminished merely \nbecause the debts have become legally unenforceable owing to the \npassage of time. Security clearance decisions are not controlled or limited \nby any statute of limitations, and reliance on the non-collectability of a debt \ndoes not constitute a good-faith effort to resolve that debt within the \nmeaning of the Directive. A security clearance adjudication is not a \nproceeding aimed at collecting an applicant\u2019s personal debts. Rather a \nsecurity clearance adjudication is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in making a decision \nabout the applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Accordingly, even if a delinquent \ndebt is legally unenforceable . . . , the federal government is entitled to \nconsider the facts and circumstances surrounding an applicant\u2019s conduct in \nincurring and failing to satisfy the debt in a timely manner.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n17-01473 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2018) quoting ISCR Case No. 10-03656 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jan 19, 2011) \nApplicant\u2019s reliance that debts may have fallen off his credit report to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns raised by his delinquent debts is misguided. Insufficient evidence was \nprovided, and he failed to meet his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me \nwith questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security \nclearance. For all these reasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security \nconcerns raised under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph   1.f:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On October 29, 2021, the Government \nsubmitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM) consisting of a statement of the \nGovernment\u2019s position and six documents pre-marked as Item 1 through Item 6. The SOR \nand Applicant\u2019s SOR response were included as Item 1 and Item 2, respectively. On \nNovember 1, 2021, DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to Applicant and instructed him \nthat any response was due within 30 days of receipt. Applicant received the FORM on \nNovember 15, 2021, and he submitted a timely response to which the Government did not \nobject. \nOn February 2, 2022, the case was assigned to me to determine whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance \nfor Applicant. I received the case file and assignment on February 11, 2022. Applicant\u2019s \nFORM response was accepted in evidence as an exhibit (AE A). \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of August 6, 2021, Applicant was \nindebted on charged-off automobile loans of $17,144 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and $10,547 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.b), and on a collection debt of $846 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). Under Guideline H, Applicant is alleged \nto have used marijuana with varying frequency from about February 2017 to at least April \n2019 (SOR \u00b6 2.a); to have purchased marijuana on various occasions from 2017 to \nDecember 2018 (SOR \u00b6 2.b); and to have been charged with driver in possession of \nmarijuana in April 2019 (SOR \u00b6 2.c). (Item 1.) \nWhen Applicant answered the SOR, he admitted the three debts, but stated that \nthey \u201chave all since been closed and removed.\u201d He explained that he had co-signed on \nvehicle loans for his father (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and younger brother (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Neither his \nfather, who became unemployed, nor his brother, who had been in an accident, could \nmaintain the payments. Applicant acknowledged the collections debt (SOR \u00b6 1.c) had been \non his credit report, but he did not recognize it. Applicant acknowledged that he had used \nmarijuana to relax in the past before he realized it was not helping to realize his goal of \nimproving his life. (Item 2.) After considering Items 1 through 6, and Applicant\u2019s FORM \nresponse (AE A), I make the following findings of fact: \nApplicant is 32 years old and unmarried. He has no children. Applicant\u2019s parents \ncame to the United States from Mexico before Applicant and his two brothers, ages 33 and \n30, were born. Applicant lives with his parents in their home and pays rent for his room. \nApplicant graduated from high school in June 2007. In March 2013, he began working full \ntime for an investment company. While maintaining that job, he began part-time college \nstudies in February 2016. Two years into his nursing studies, he switched his focus and \nentered an aerospace fabrication program, which he completed in the spring of 2020.

(Item 3.) \nApplicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF 86) on \nAugust 15, 2020, to initiate a background investigation for initial security clearance eligibility \nfor him. On his SF 86, he indicated an intention to return to college \u201cshortly\u201d to complete his \nassociate\u2019s and bachelor\u2019s degrees. (Item 3.) Applicant apparently resumed his studies \nshortly after he completed his SF 86 because he gave his college email address as contact \ninformation on his August 21, 2020 response to the SOR. (Item 2.) \nFinancial \nOn his August 2020 SF 86, Applicant listed two charged-off vehicle loans with \nbalances of $17,144 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and $10,547 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Applicant co-signed on the \nrespective loans on May 22, 2015, for his father, and on May 25, 2015, for his younger \nbrother. (Items 3-5.) He explained on his SF 86 that his brother had an accident and then \ncould not afford to pay for the damages, and that his father lost his job and could not \nmaintain the payments on his loan. Regarding efforts to address these debts, Applicant \nrelated that he had taken no action toward resolving the loan for his brother\u2019s vehicle, and \nhe did not know the full details of what occurred. He added that his brother had spoken to \nthe dealer and \u201cplans on making it right.\u201d Applicant stated that his father assured him that \nhe would begin repaying his loan when he is in a better financial position. (Item 3.) \nA check of Applicant\u2019s credit on September 5, 2020, reflected that Applicant had \nbeen 180 days past due previously on his three of his four federal student loans. The loans \nwere in deferment with an aggregate balance of $12,731. A fourth federal student loan of \n$1,750 was also deferred. However, Applicant had not made his first monthly payment of \n$44 on a $126 personal loan obtained in July 2002. Applicant was making payments \naccording to terms on a cell phone debt of $363. Four small personal loans of $95, $328, \n$120, and $333 had been paid off according to account terms. A car loan that Applicant \nobtained in February 2012 for $16,356 had been paid off in April 2018, but after he had \nredeemed the vehicle following a repossession. The vehicle loans listed on his SF 86 were \nobtained for $18,369 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and $17,523 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and charged off to profit and \nloss in July 2020. Additionally, a collection entity was reporting an unpaid $846 debt \nassigned in October 2016 (SOR \u00b6 1.c). \nDuring a September 16, 2020 personal subject interview (PSI) with an authorized \ninvestigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), Applicant explained that his \nfather was currently unemployed \u201cdue to COVID.\u201d Applicant denied any responsibility for \nthe $10,547 charged-off loan balance for his brother\u2019s vehicle and stated that his brother \nwas working with the dealership to resolve the debt. He stated that the account may have \ngone two to three months past due. As for the loan co-signed for his father, Applicant \nasserted that his father caught up on his payments, and the account was in good standing. \nHe denied any other past-due accounts in the last seven years. When confronted with the \nadverse information on his credit record, Applicant responded that he was unaware why \nthe loan co-signed for his father was still showing as past due.

Applicant did not recognize the $846 collection debt, but surmised the debt may \nstem from him missing the payment date for a ticket received in May 2013 for having a \nheadlight out. He claimed to have paid the ticket late, although he could not recall the \npayment date. He disputed the debt if, in fact, it was for the ticket. As for his three student \nloans that were previously delinquent, Applicant stated that the accounts went two months \npast due but were deferred until he completed his schooling. Regarding the paid off car \nloan for the vehicle redeemed after repossession, Applicant stated that he fell behind a \ncouple of months in his payments, but he was able to pay the balance and keep his car. He \nattributed the debt issues to immaturity and stated that he should have known better than \nto co-sign on a vehicle loan. He explained that he was making more effort to keep his \naccounts in good standing. (Item 6.) \nApplicant was given an opportunity to provide documentation regarding the financial \ndelinquencies to the OPM investigator after his interview to substantiate his disputes with \nthe information on his credit report. The OPM investigator received no documentation. \n(Item 6.) \nAs of July 26, 2021, Applicant\u2019s credit report from Equifax was showing no progress \ntoward the vehicle loans that Applicant had co-signed. The loan for his father\u2019s car had \nbeen charged off for $17,639 and was last paid in January 2016. It was reportedly past due \nfor $17,144. The loan for his brother had been charged off for $10,547 due to nonpayment \nsince September 2015, although the creditor was reporting a zero balance after being \nwritten off. Applicant\u2019s student loans were rated as \u201cpays account as agreed.\u201d The \ncollection debt (SOR \u00b6 1.c) was not on Applicant\u2019s credit report. (Item 4.) \nOn August 12, 2021, in response to the SOR, Applicant stated that the three debts \nwere \u201cstill active\u201d as of his completion of his SF 86 and his PSI, \u201cbut have all since been \nclosed or removed.\u201d He related about the co-signed loans that he had been \u201casked just to \nput up a pay stub and co-sign to make the loan process easier\u201d to help his father and \nbrother. However, his father was unable to make the payments due to a job loss, and his \nbrother incurred several medical expenses from \u201cgetting into a terrible accident shortly after \nsigning for the car.\u201d Applicant added that he had not had any issues with his credit since \nthen. He stated that he had no comment as to the collection debt (SOR \u00b6 1.c) inasmuch as \nhe was unfamiliar with it and did not receive requested information about the debt from the \ncreditor. He provided a then current screenshot from his Experian credit report showing \nthat he had no collection accounts on his record and that both of the car loans had been \nclosed, although the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.a was still reporting a balance of $17,144 as of \nJuly 31, 2021. Applicant commented, \u201cI am happy to say these debts are no longer an \nissue.\u201d (Item 2.) \nApplicant provided no credit records in response to the FORM. In an undated \nstatement received by DOHA in December 2021, Applicant explained that even after the \ncar loans went into collections, he was unable to make a firm commitment to aid his father \nor brother as he had just resumed his schooling and was working part time earning \u201ca little \nmore than the minimum wage.\u201d He had his own car payment, rent, and other expenses that \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nleft him unable rather than unwilling to make the car payments for his family members. He \nexpressed that his finances would not be an issue going forward, as restoring his credit \nrating was a top priority. (AE A.) \nDrug Involvement \nOn his August 2020 SF 86, Applicant disclosed in response to police record \ninquiries an April 2019 charge of marijuana while operating a vehicle for which he was \nsentenced to traffic school and fined. He indicated the charge was a misdemeanor, \nalthough sheriff and court records in Item 6 indicate it was an infraction. He stated about \nthe offense, \u201cI was at the wrong place, at the wrong time and got a serious wake up call. It \nwas a hard lesson learned and I no longer associate myself with that stuff.\u201d In response to \nan SF 86 inquiry into any illegal use of drugs or controlled substances in the last seven \nyears, Applicant reported that he \u201conly used marijuana,\u201d but that he smoked the drug \n\u201cregularly\u201d on his days off from work between February 2017 and May 2019. He denied any \nintention to use the drug in the future, explaining: \nThe last time I used marijuana it resulted in a traffic ticket and from then on I \ncame to the realization that it just doesn\u2019t really do anything positive for me in \nany way. I used [marijuana] for a few years and it was ok but I no longer \nhave any desire to use marijuana in any way. (Item 3.) \nDuring his September 2020 PSI, Applicant explained about the marijuana charge \nthat he went to a friend\u2019s house after work in April 2019, and while he was waiting outside, \na sheriff\u2019s officer approached and asked him his purpose. Applicant consented to a search \nof his vehicle, and marijuana was found under the seat. Applicant admitted to the OPM \ninvestigator that he had used marijuana in the past, but that the marijuana found belonged \nto his cousin. Applicant had forgotten about the marijuana left in his vehicle by his cousin. \nApplicant was issued a citation for possession of less than an ounce of marijuana, even \nthough he denied having used any marijuana that day. Applicant stated that he never had \nto appear in court and that all he needed to do was attend an online traffic school, which \ncost him $657. As for his use of marijuana, Applicant explained that he obtained the \nmarijuana that he used from that same cousin, and they smoked it together during \nApplicant\u2019s days off from work. The marijuana had a relaxing effect on him. Applicant \ndenied any current association with anyone that uses any illegal drug, including marijuana, \nand any intention to use marijuana in the future. (Item 6.) \nOn July 23, 2021, Applicant responded to interrogatories from DOHA about his drug \nuse. He responded negatively to a query about any use of marijuana or other product \ncontaining tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) since his September 2020 PSI, even if it was legal \nunder state law. He answered \u201cYes\u201d to a question concerning any purchase of marijuana or \nproducts containing THC since August 2013, and explained that he purchased marijuana \n\u201cabout once every 6-8 weeks from early to mid 2017 to late December 2018\u201d from that \nsame cousin with whom he had used marijuana. He denied any purchase of marijuana \nsince late December 2018 and added that he had matured \u201ca lot\u201d since then and is no \nlonger involved with marijuana in any way. He responded \u201cNo\u201d to inquiries concerning \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhether he currently possessed any marijuana, THC products, other illegal drugs, or drug \nparaphernalia; whether he lived with or associated with any person who uses any illegal \ndrugs; whether he frequents places where he has reason to believe marijuana or THC \nproducts are being sold or used; and whether he had any drug counseling or treatment or \nparticipated in a support group such as Narcotics Anonymous. Applicant also indicated that \nhe had not been drug tested. At DOHA\u2019s request, Applicant provided records showing that \nhe had been cited for having marijuana in his possession while driving on April 5, 2019; \nthat he had been convicted on October 1, 2019; and that he had completed court-ordered \ntraffic school online on September 27, 2019. (Item 6.) \nIn his December 2021 response to the FORM, Applicant expressed deep regret for \nhis marijuana use and a desire to move forward from the person he had been. He stated \nthat marijuana had not been an issue for a few years and that he was open to regular drug \ntesting if required. He added that he had learned form his past mistakes and was working \non improving all aspects of his life. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also  EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nGuideline F security concerns are established when an individual fails to pay \nfinancial obligations according to terms. Applicant co-signed on two vehicle loans within \nthree days in May 2015 because he wanted to help his father and brother, who apparently \nwould not have qualified for the loans on their own. His brother stopped paying on the loan \nfor his vehicle in September 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.b).

As a co-signer, Applicant accepted legal contractual \nresponsibility for repayment of the defaulted loans. During his PSI, he expressed his belief \nthat he had no responsibility to repay the loan for his brother\u2019s car. However, if he was \nfound responsible, he would work with the dealership to pay the debt. He now asserts that \nhe wanted to make the loan payments for his family members but he could not afford to do \nso. Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of \nnot meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply because of the defaulted auto loans. \nRegarding the $846 collection debt, Applicant did not recognize it when asked about \nit during his PSI, although he speculated that it may be for a traffic ticket paid late. He \nadmitted the debt in response to the SOR, but then stated in response to the FORM that \nhe had no success in attempting to verify the debt. The Appeal Board has held that \nadverse information from a credit report is normally sufficient to meet the substantial \nevidence standard to establish a debt. See ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. \n25, 2015) (citing, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 3 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). Applicant \npresented no documentation of any efforts to investigate or dispute that debt. \nAs of July 26, 2021, Equifax was no longer reporting it on Applicant\u2019s credit report. \nHowever, the Appeal Board noted in ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, \n2015) and reiterated in ISCR Case No. 26-01338 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 13, 2018) that the fact \nthat a debt no longer appears on a credit report is not \u201cmeaningful, independent evidence \nas to the disposition of the debt.\u201d The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires removal of most \nnegative financial items from a credit report seven years from the first date of delinquency \nor if they become no longer legally collectible because of a state statute of limitations, \nwhichever is longer. See Title 15, U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c. Debts may also be dropped from a \ncredit report upon dispute when the creditor believes the debt is not going to be paid or \nwhen the debt has been charged off. The lender in SOR \u00b6 1.b writing off the $10,534 \nbalance and reporting a zero balance on Applicant\u2019s July 2021 credit report is a case in \npoint. Debts may still have security significance if they are no longer legally collectible or \nhave been dropped from a credit report, particularly if they resulted from financially \nirresponsible behavior or remain unaddressed without reasonable justification. Given the \nabsence of any evidence showing the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c is not his legitimate obligation, AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply to that debt as well. \nApplicant has the burdens of production and persuasion in establishing sufficient \nmitigation to overcome the financial concerns raised by the delinquent accounts. One or \nmore of the following conditions under AG \u00b6 20 may apply in whole or in part: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) cannot reasonably apply in mitigation because of Applicant\u2019s ongoing \ndisregard of the established delinquent debts. An applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts \nevidence a continuing course of conduct and are considered recent. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 17-03146 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-08779 at 3 (App. Bd. \nNov. 3, 2017)). \nApplicant provided no documentation about his brother\u2019s accident or his father\u2019s \nunemployment. While these are the types of unforeseen circumstances that could trigger \nAG \u00b6 20(b) in mitigation of the initial defaults, Applicant knowingly assumed legal liability for \ntwo car loans totaling some $36,162 in May 2015. It is not clear that he could reasonably \nafford to repay them in the event his father and brother did not make their payments. \nMoreover, mitigating condition AG \u00b6 20(b) requires that an individual take responsible steps \ntoward resolving the debts. If his brother worked out a deal with the lender to relieve him \nand Applicant of their joint liability for repayment of the charged-off $10,534 balance, it was \nincumbent on Applicant to provide proof of any such arrangement, and he did not do so. \nRegarding the loan co-signed for his father, Applicant stated during his September 2020 \nPSI that he would check with his father about the status of the debt and, if required, would \nwork with the dealership on repayment arrangements. Applicant now asserts that he could \nnot afford to repay the loans on his income. He resumed his schooling and worked part \ntime earning little more than the minimum wage. Even so, he had an obligation to contact \nthe creditors and attempt to negotiate repayment terms that he could afford. There is no \nevidence that he did so. He seemed to think that because the creditors had charged off the \ndebts and were not actively pursuing him for the balances, they were \u201cno longer an issue.\u201d \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully established. \nMoreover, without any evidence by Applicant to resolve the debts in the SOR or \nalternatively seek some relief from the creditors as to his legal liability for repayment, such \nas removing him from the loans in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, neither AG \u00b6 20(c) nor AG \u00b6 20(d) \nhas any applicability. An applicant is not required to establish that he or she has paid off \neach debt in the SOR, or even that the first debts paid be those in the SOR. See ISCR \nCase No. 07-06482 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). However, \u201can applicant must demonstrate a \nplan for debt repayment, accompanied by concomitant conduct, that is, conduct that \nevidences a serious intent to resolve the debts.\u201d See, e.g., ADP Case No. 17-00263 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2018). \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe security clearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed at collecting an \napplicant\u2019s personal debts. It is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness with regard to his fitness or suitability to handle classified \ninformation appropriately. See ISCR Case No. 09-92160 at 5 (App. Bd. June 21, 2010). \nApplicant asserts that restoring his credit is a priority for him, and his July 2021 credit \nreport shows that he obtained deferments of his federal student loans, which had been \nseriously delinquent in the past. He was able to redeem his car following repossession and \npaid off his loan in April 2018. His September 2020 credit report reflects timely payments \non several small installment loans. Nonetheless, ignoring debts until they drop from one\u2019s \ncredit report or are no longer legally collectable is not sound financial judgment for security \nclearance purposes. Applicant did not adequately mitigate the financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concerns about drug involvement and substance misuse are set forth in \nAG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of prescription \nand non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances that cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness, both because such behavior may lead to physical or \npsychological impairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s \nability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. Controlled \nsubstance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. \nSubstance misuse is the generic term adopted in this guideline to describe \nany of the behaviors listed above. \nIn addition to the above matters, I note that the state where Applicant was born, \nraised, and educated legalized marijuana use, possession, and purchase of small amounts \nof cannabis by adults 21 years of age or older on November 8, 2016. However, marijuana \nremains a Schedule I controlled substance under federal law pursuant to Title 21, Section \n812 of the United States Code. Schedule I drugs are those which have a high potential for \nabuse; have no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States; and lack \naccepted safety for use of the drug under medical supervision. Section 844 under Title 21 \nof the United States Code makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly or intentionally \npossess a controlled substance not obtained pursuant to a valid prescription. On October \n25, 2014, the then Director of National Intelligence (DNI) issued guidance that changes to \nlaws by some states and the District of Columbia to legalize or decriminalize the \nrecreational use of marijuana do not alter existing federal law or the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines, and that an individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the \nuse, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in national security \ndeterminations. \n10 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nApplicant seemed to realize this as he listed his marijuana use from February 2017 \nto April 2019 on his SF 86. Although he reported on his SF 86 that he used marijuana until \nMay 2019 that date is inconsistent with his explanation that his last use of marijuana \nresulted in a traffic ticket. His citation and traffic court records show he was cited on April 5, \n2019. Applicant described his marijuana use as \u201cregularly on [his] days off [from] work.\u201d \nDuring his PSI, Applicant did not indicate any frequency as to his marijuana use other than \nit occurred with his cousin on his days off. In response to drug interrogatories, Applicant \ndisclosed that he purchased marijuana about once every six weeks from early-to-mid 2017 \nuntil late December 2018 from the cousin with whom he used marijuana. He did not \nprovide any details as to his expenditures for marijuana. Disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6 \n25(a), \u201cany substance misuse,\u201d and 25(c), \u201cillegal possession of a controlled substance, \nincluding cultivation, processing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or \npossession of drug paraphernalia,\u201d apply. \nApplicant bears the burden of establishing that matters in mitigation apply. AG \u00b6 26 \nprovides for mitigation as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non an individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were \nused; and \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all \nillegal drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging \nthat any future involvement or misuse is grounds for revocation \nof national security eligibility; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness during \nwhich these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, including, \nbut not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, without \nrecurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified medical \nprofessional. \nAG \u00b6 26(a) has some applicability in mitigation. Applicant was not specific about his \nmarijuana use other than that it was regular. It occurred too often to be reasonably \ncharacterized as infrequent. There is no \u201cbright line\u201d for determining when conduct is recent \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfor purposes of mitigation. See ISCR Case No. 02-24452 at 6 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2004). \nApplicant stopped using marijuana about 18 months before he completed his SF 86 in \nAugust 2020. There is no evidence of any recurrence since then. As of the record closure \nin this case in December 2021, it was not recent. Neither AG \u00b6 26(c) nor AG \u00b6 26(d) was \nshown to apply in this case. \nRegarding AG \u00b6 26(b)(1), Applicant indicated during his September 2020 PSI and in \nresponse to drug interrogatories in July 2021 that he does not associate with anyone who \nuses marijuana, any THC products, or any other illegal drug. He did not clearly indicate \nthat he no longer associates with the cousin with whom he used marijuana and from whom \nhe purchased marijuana. AG \u00b6 26(b)(1) has not been conclusively established. \nAG \u00b6 26(b)(3) applies in his favor, however. Applicant\u2019s candor about his marijuana \ninvolvement on his SF 86, during his PSI, and in response to drug interrogatories, allows \nme to accept as credible his repeated denials of any intention to use marijuana in the \nfuture. The driving while in possession of marijuana infraction is a credible reason why he \nwould decide to stop using marijuana. While he has not executed a statement \nacknowledging that any future drug involvement would be grounds for revocation of \nnational security eligibility, it is clear from his responses to the FORM and SOR that \nunderstands that any future marijuana use would be inconsistent with clearance eligibility. \nIn response to the FORM, he expressed a willingness to undergo drug testing. Although his \nmarijuana uses and purchases are not condoned, more than 2\u00bd years have passed since \nApplicant last used marijuana. The drug involvement and substance misuse security \nconcerns are mitigated by the passage of time with no intention to engage in illegal drug \nuse in the future. \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Those factors are: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nThe analyses under Guideline F and Guideline H are incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, \nbut some warrant additional comment. \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nApplicant was only 25 years old when he co-signed on the two loans. His desire to \nassist his father and younger brother is a positive character trait. However, he knew that his \nbrother was unable to make his car payments after his accident, which happened within \nmonths of the car\u2019s purchase. Applicant spent money on marijuana in 2017 and 2018 as \nthe loan went unpaid. As of August 2020, Applicant was on notice that the DOD was \nconcerned about the delinquencies that were on his credit report, and he has done nothing \nto resolve them as of December 2021. Applicant has yet to demonstrate that he can be \ncounted on to exercise the judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness that must be expected \nfrom those persons granted access to classified information. It is well settled that once a \nconcern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong \npresumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, \n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). Based on the evidence of record, it is not clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue security clearance \neligibility for Applicant. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the Guideline F allegations (SOR (\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.l), with narrative comments for each debt. He admitted the Guideline E allegation at SOR \u00b6 2.a, also with an explanation. He \u201cadmitted\u201d the two falsification allegations at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c, but I construe his explanation as a denial. His admissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 61 years old. He and his wife have been married since 1998. They have two grown children. Applicant graduated from high school in 1979. He attended college from 1979 to 1983 but did not earn a degree. He attended subsequent schooling more than 10 years ago, some of which was financed by student loans at issue in this case, as discussed below. He served in the U.S. Navy from 1986 to 1996, and received an honorable discharge. (Item 2) On his SCA, Applicant detailed his employment since 2006. From mid-2006 through late 2010, Applicant worked in Afghanistan as an avionics technician for a defense contractor. He returned home in November 2010 when his employer lost the contract that employed him. He was then unemployed until May 2011. He then returned to Afghanistan for a different contractor.

He elected to have his case \ndecided by an administrative judge of the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) on the administrative (written) record, in lieu of a hearing. On February 17, 2022, \nDOHA Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM), \nincluding documents identified as Items 1 through 6. DOHA mailed the FORM to Applicant \non February 23. 2022. He had 30 days to file objections and submit material in refutation, \nextenuation, or mitigation. On or about March 14, 2022, Applicant contacted Department \nCounsel to report that he had received the FORM and to request additional time to \nrespond. \nApplicant subsequently provided an unsigned, undated narrative statement \n(FORM Item A) and four documents, marked as FORM Items B through D. On May 16, \n2022, Department Counsel waived any objections. The case was then forwarded to the \nDOHA Hearing Office, and assigned to me on June 21, 2022. FORM Items A through D \nare admitted without objection. The SOR and the answer (combined as Item 1) are the \npleadings in the case. Items 2 through 6 are admitted into evidence without objection. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the Guideline F allegations (SOR \n(\u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.l), with narrative comments for each debt. He admitted the Guideline E \nallegation at SOR \u00b6 2.a, also with an explanation. He \u201cadmitted\u201d the two falsification \nallegations at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c, but I construe his explanation as a denial. His \nadmissions are incorporated into the findings of fact. After a thorough and careful review \nof the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 61 years old. He and his wife have been married since 1998. They \nhave two grown children. Applicant graduated from high school in 1979. He attended \ncollege from 1979 to 1983 but did not earn a degree. He attended subsequent schooling \nmore than 10 years ago, some of which was financed by student loans at issue in this \ncase, as discussed below. He served in the U.S. Navy from 1986 to 1996, and received \nan honorable discharge. (Item 2) \nOn his SCA, Applicant detailed his employment since 2006. From mid-2006 \nthrough late 2010, Applicant worked in Afghanistan as an avionics technician for a \ndefense contractor. He returned home in November 2010 when his employer lost the \ncontract that employed him. He was then unemployed until May 2011. He then returned \nto Afghanistan for a different contractor. He worked in Afghanistan until April 2017, when \nthat contract ended. (Item 2) He then worked for the same employer in a new position as \nan aircraft mechanic in the U.S. from April 2017 to October 2018. He then took a break \nfor personal reasons, and was unemployed for about four months, until February 2019. \n(Item 2) He then returned to the job in February 2019, and has worked there ever since. \nHe did not indicate on his SCA that he holds a clearance but references a \u201c10-year review\u201d \nin his FORM Response, which suggests that his current SCA is a periodic reinvestigation. \n(Item 2, Item 3; SOR Response; AE A) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant submitted an SCA in February 2020. In answering questions about his \nfinancial record, he disclosed that in April 2017, \u201cI got behind on my payments on my \ntravel card. I got a verbal counseling from my manager.\u201d He said the amount was about \n$3,000, and he said he had paid the debt owed. (Item 2 at 37) (SOR \u00b6 2.a) \nApplicant explained in his background interview that he had been working in a \nlarge U.S. city (presumably on business) and had incurred charges on his company credit \ncard. He owed \u201cless than $5,000\u201d on the card and was two or three months late in paying \nthe card due to financial issues. Company policy required that employees pay the card in \nfull each month. He received a counseling letter from his manager for missing payments. \nHe borrowed money from his company 401(k) plan and paid the money within 30 days of \nreceiving the counseling letter. (Item 3 at 2) (SOR \u00b6 2.a) \nApplicant said he was not terminated as a result, nor did he resign in lieu of being \nfired. He explained that he left the company after the travel assignment in order to spend \nmore time with his family. He later rejoined the company in February 2019. (Item 3 at 2; \nItem 2) The letter Applicant received is not in evidence, nor is the company credit card \npolicy documented. \nIn answering SOR \u00b6 2.a, Applicant said he was \u201cin a financial struggle at the time \nand got in a bad situation with the company card.\u201d He has \u201ccleared up the matter and \nthere are no other work-related issues.\u201d He attested to an excellent work ethic and there \nare no concerns about his integrity. (FORM Response Item A) \nIn answering other financial questions on his SCA, Applicant did not disclose that \nhe had any delinquent debts, such as judgments entered against him, debts reported for \ncollection, or charged-off accounts. (Item 2 at 37-38) (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b, 2.c) \nApplicant subsequently had a background interview in July 2020. In reviewing his \nanswers on his SCA with the interviewing agent, he noted that he was \u201cgetting by\u201d \nfinancially, \u201cand he may be 30-120 days late on some bills.\u201d He acknowledged having \naccounts in collections. He said he did not list the accounts because he did not know the \naccount information to do so accurately on the SCA. He was then provided the account \ninformation from his credit report, and he discussed his debts in detail. (Item 3 at 3-4) In \nanswering SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c, Applicant explained that he did not intend to falsify his \nanswers on his SCA, but got \u201coverwhelmed with the questions.\u201d (Item 1) \nApplicant explained in his background interview that between 2006 and 2010, \nwhen he was working overseas, he made a good income and was able to keep up with \nexpenses. This changed when he returned to the U.S., and he made less money. He was \nunable to keep up with his bills and expenses, and he said he has been trying to address \nhis debts by making money through increased overtime. (Item 3 at 4) \nThe debts alleged in the SOR total about $34,000. (Item 1) The record includes \ntwo credit bureau reports (CBRs), dated June 2020 and May 2021, which establish the \ndelinquent accounts alleged.

(Item 4, Item 5; \nAnswer) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($4,820), 1.i ($883), and 1.j ($420) are federal student loans that are \npast due. Applicant admits the debts, but was not aware that he still owed them. He \nthought they may be loans he cosigned for his daughter\u2019s education but he now believes \nthey are his. He intends to contact the creditor to bring them current. (Item 4, Item 5; \nAnswer) In his FORM Response, he indicates that he has begun repayments on his \nfederal student loans, but he provides no details. (I note that since March 2020, federal \nstudent loans have been in forbearance status by presidential executive order due to the \nCOVID pandemic. The forbearance program is scheduled to conclude at the end of \nDecember 2022). \nSOR \u00b6 1.c ($4,167) is an account that has been charged off by a bank. Applicant \nexplains that he incurred this debt, like others, during a time of financial hardship when \nhe was \u201coverwhelmed\u201d and not able to pay his family\u2019s monthly bills. (Item 4, Item 5; \nAnswer) In his FORM Response, he says he has set up a payment plan for this debt but \nhe provides no details, and no corroborating documentation. (FORM Response Item A) \nThis debt is unresolved. \nSOR \u00b6 1.d ($2,789) is an account placed for collection by Bank C. Applicant said \nin his Answer that he is in a monthly payment plan. (Item 4, Item 5; Answer) With his \nFORM Response, he provided a statement from the creditor reflecting biweekly payments \nof about $73 between August 2021 and March 2022. As of March 2022, the balance owed \nwas $954. (FORM Item D) This account is being paid. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e ($2,673) is an account placed for collection by Bank B. Applicant said \nin his Answer that he is in a monthly payment plan. (Item 4, Item 5; Answer) With his \nFORM Response, he provided a statement from the creditor reflecting a payment in \nMarch 2022 of about $90. As of March 2022, the balance owed was $1,518. (FORM Item \nC) This account is being paid. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f ($1,484) and 1.l ($1,963) are accounts that have been charged off by \nBank B. Applicant admits the two debts but believed that they were being handled by the \ncollection agent for SOR debt \u00b6 1.e. (Item 4, Item 5; Answer) He provided no \ndocumentation to support this. \nSOR \u00b6 1.g ($1,188) is an account that has been charged off by Bank C. Applicant \nintends to address this debt in turn, but it remains unresolved. (Item 4, Item 5; Answer) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h ($866) is an account placed for collection by a phone company. \nApplicant said he has made payments towards this debt, and provided documentation \nwith his FORM Response that the account has been paid.

(Item 5) As noted in the SOR, the account was \nresolved through wage garnishment, and the judgment was satisfied in June 2020. (Item \n1) The Government\u2019s evidence includes the Notice of Satisfaction, a document Applicant \nprovided during his background interview. (Item 3 at 5, Item 6) The debt was therefore \nresolved well before issuance of the SOR, albeit through garnishment.  \nIn his FORM Response, Applicant acknowledges that he has accumulated debt \nand has struggled with paying it off. He says he and his wife have not made good financial \nchoices in the past, but work hard to provide food and shelter for their family while \naddressing their debts as they can. He also helps his mother with her bills and food. He \ncannot pay all of his debts at once but will continue to address his debts as he can. He \nsaid he recently paid off his car and a phone debt (SOR \u00b6 1.h), and he said he has set up \na payment plan for SOR debt \u00b6 1.c. He says he has begun repayments on his student \nloans. (Form Response Item A) \nApplicant also states in his FORM Response that he did not intend to lie when he \nfailed to disclose his debts on his SCA. He thought he had addressed his debts in a \nprevious section of his SCA and was too hasty in answering the questions in an effort to \ncomplete the application in a timely manner. (FORM Response Item A) \nApplicant states that he is not a security risk to his employer or to the country. He \nunderstands the security concern arising from his debts. He works hard, and volunteers \nto help others. He enjoys his job and would never compromise security. (FORM \nResponse Item A) \nApplicant did not provide any documents or other information about his current \nincome and expenses to detail his ability to address his debts responsibly going forward. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out, \nin relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has a long history of financial issues, going back to 2010, after he \nreturned from Afghanistan. All of the debts alleged in the SOR are established by the \ncredit reports in the record, and by Applicant\u2019s admissions. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts.  \nApplicant has resolved some of his debts in full (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.k) and he is \nresolving others (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e). His debts otherwise remain outstanding. He \nindicates an intention to pay the others as he can but has set forth little documentation of \nhis efforts or ability to do so. His debts are largely ongoing and unresolved. They continue \nto cast doubt on his current reliability, judgment, and trustworthiness. AG \u00b6 20(a) does \nnot apply. \nApplicant stated in his interview that he fell behind on his bills after his income \ndeclined following his return from Afghanistan in 2010. For the most part, he has been \ngainfully employed, with the same company, ever since; the only exception being a brief \nperiod during the winter of 2018-2019, when he left the job for personal reasons. But his \nfinancial issues predate that time, as he used a company credit card for almost $5,000 \nfor what were presumably personal charges, since he was required to repay them. (This \nconduct is alleged under Guideline E and discussed further below, but is not alleged under \nGuideline F. As such, I have not considered it as Guideline F disqualifying conduct, \nthough I can and do consider it here as part of Applicant\u2019s full financial history in weighing \nmitigation). \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has not established that his debts are due to conditions beyond his \ncontrol. The decline in income he experienced after returning from Afghanistan is too \nremote in time to be considered such a circumstance at this point. His SOR debts all post-\ndate that experience. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply.  \nSome of Applicant\u2019s debts have been paid. Others are in a payment plan. One \ndebt was resolved before the SOR was issued, through wage garnishment following a \njudgment against him. However, resolution of a debt through garnishment does not \nestablish good-faith efforts by an applicant. Applicant says he intends to address his \nremaining debts as best he can but he has not set forth enough sufficient evidence under \nAG \u00b6 20(d) that he initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to pay or resolve his \nremaining debts. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply, as Applicant has not shown that he has \nparticipated in credit counseling or that his debts are being resolved or are under control. \nAs Applicant notes, he is not required to pay his debts off all at once, or in any \nparticular way. What is required, though, is a reasonable plan to address his debts, \naccompanied by documented efforts to do so. Applicant has taken some steps in this \nregard, but given his lengthy history of financial problems, he has not provided sufficient \nevidence that his financial issues are under control. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations . . . determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with \nrules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nincludes, but is not limited to, consideration of: . . . (4) evidence of significant \nmisuse of Government or other employer's time or resources; \nSOR \u00b6 2.a reads as follows: \nYou received a written reprimand in about April 2017 from your employer, \n[name redacted], for violating your employer-issued credit card policies. \nApplicant admitted the allegation with an explanation. He explained in his \nbackground interview that he received a written letter of counseling for missing payments \non his credit card in April 2017. He also noted that company policy required that the \namount owed on the company credit card was to be paid in full each month. Once he \nreceived the letter, Applicant borrowed from his 401(k) plan and paid the amount owed \n(something less than $5,000) within a month. The counseling letter is not part of the \nrecord, nor are the company credit card policies, except as noted in the interview. \nAlthough Applicant was counseled, it is not established that he was reprimanded, \nnotwithstanding his admission to the allegation. Nevertheless, the facts support a finding \nthat Applicant violated company policy by failing to pay his company credit card bill in full \neach month on at least this occasion, in April 2017. Applicant\u2019s actions implicate the \ngeneral security concern of AG \u00b6 15, as conduct involving questionable judgment, as well \nas AG \u00b6 16(d)(4), given his significant misuse of company resources. SOR \u00b6 2.a is \nestablished.  \nThe Government also alleged that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose his \nvarious delinquent debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.l), as listed on his June 2020 credit report (Item \n5) when he submitted his February 2020 SCA. (Item 2 at 37-38) Applicant denied the \nallegations of intentional falsification in his Answer. While he failed to disclose his debts \n(as he should have), he did disclose his earlier April 2017 misuse of a company credit \ncard, and noted that he had $3,000 in debts on the card, later paid off. Applicant also \nraised the issue of his financial delinquencies at the start of the discussion of his financial \nrecord. He noted that he was \u201cgetting by\u201d financially, \u201cand that he may be 30-120 days \nlate on some bills.\u201d He acknowledged having accounts in collections. He said he did not \nlist the accounts because he did not know the account information to do so accurately on \nthe SCA. This establishes AG \u00b6 17(a) (the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to \ncorrect the omission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts). \nApplicant denied the allegations of deliberate falsification, so the Government has \nthe burden to prove them. Given Applicant\u2019s explanations, the fact that he reported his \ncredit card misuse on his SCA, and his early candor about his debts in his interview, I \ncannot conclude that falsification is definitively established under AG \u00b6 16(a). SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b \nand 1.c are found for Applicant. \nAG \u00b6 17 sets forth the potentially applicable mitigating conditions under Guideline \nE. Of those, the following warrants discussion: \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment.  \nThough it is alleged as a personal conduct security concern under Guideline E, \nrather than a financial security concern under Guideline F, Applicant\u2019s misuse of a \ncompany credit card in 2017 occurred because he found himself in \u201ca financial struggle\u201d \nat the time, as he put it. That financial struggle continues, since Applicant has ongoing \ndelinquent debt, as he has had for quite some time. Even though the conduct (misusing \na company credit card for personal expenses and then failing to pay it in a timely manner) \nhas not been repeated, the conditions that sowed the seeds for that conduct nonetheless \nremain ongoing, since he still has delinquent debts. Since that is the case, AG \u00b6 17(c) \ndoes not apply to mitigate the credit card conduct at SOR \u00b6 2.a. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient evidence to mitigate his delinquent debts, or his \nrelated personal conduct. I considered his career in the defense industry including with \nhis current employer as favorable whole person evidence. Since Applicant requested a \ndecision on the written record, I did not have the opportunity to question him in a hearing \nabout the allegations in the case, to better assess the reasonableness of his actions in \naddressing them. Given his financial record, Applicant needs to establish a longer track \nrecord of financial stability to establish that he is eligible for access to classified \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \ninformation. Overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. For these reasons, I conclude Applicant did \nnot provide sufficient evidence to mitigate the financial or personal conduct security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d, 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f, 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i, 1.j: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.k: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l:  \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:   \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.b-2.c: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

Clearance is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn July 9, 2021, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DOD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing the security \nconcerns under Guideline F, financial considerations, explaining why it was unable to find it \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant security clearance eligibility. The DOD \nCAF took the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, \nDefense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as \namended (Directive); and the National Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) effective for any \nadjudication made on or after June 8, 2017. On July 31, 2021, Applicant answered the \nSOR, denying all of the allegations except subparagraphs 1.d and 1.g. He requested a \ndecision without a hearing.

Applicant did not respond. On December 2, \n2021, the case was assigned to me. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 40-year old single man with three children. Four previous marriages \nended in divorce. (Item 3 at 19-21) He is a high school graduate, as well as a veteran of \nthe U.S. Air Force where he served honorably from 2000 to 2006. (Item 3 at 17) He has \nbeen working as a cabinet installer since 2020. (Item 3 at 13) Previously, he was the fire \nchief of a municipality for five years. \nPer three credit reports pulled between 2020 and 2021, Applicant owes \napproximately $21,000 in delinquent debt. (Items 5 -7) Applicant neither provided any \nevidence supporting the basis of his disputes of the debts that he denied, nor did he \nprovide any evidence or plans to resolve the debts that he admitted. During his subject \ninterview, he attributed his financial problems to job changes and divorce. Applicant \nincluded his employment history on his security clearance application from 2009 to 2020. It \ndoes not reflect any periods of unemployment. (Item 3 at 12 -15) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . ..\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation;  \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct;  \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct;  \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary;  \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges;  \n(7) the motivation for the conduct;  \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and  \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nUnder this concern, \u201cfailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to \nabide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d (AG \u00b6 \n18) Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems triggers the application of AG \u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability \nto satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nApplicant provided no evidence substantiating the basis of his denials, nor did he \nprovide any evidence of steps taken to resolve the debts that he admitted. His contention \nthat employment problems contributed to his financial problems is unsupported by record \nevidence. Under these circumstances, I conclude that none of the mitigating conditions \napply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nGiven the paucity of evidence on file, there are no whole-person considerations that \nwould warrant a favorable conclusion. I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the \nsecurity concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.o:  \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance.

Applicant \nanswered the SOR and requested a hearing. I convened the hearing on October 19, 2022, \nvia video conference, during which Applicant testified and the Government submitted \nexhibits that I admitted to the record. Post-hearing, Applicant submitted exhibits that I \nadmitted to the record. After I received the transcript on October 31, 2022, I notified the \nGovernment\u2019s counsel that I intended to issue a summary decision, to which he did not \nobject.  \n \nApplicant, age 53, has been employed on the same defense contract with two \ndifferent employers since April 2021. He has maintained a Department of Defense (DOD) \nsecurity clearance since about 2015. He struggled with his finances due to the \nunemployment and underemployment he experienced from about 2012 through 2018, \nwhen he was unable to find consistent work as a defense contractor. During that period, \nhe defaulted on the home equity line of credit (HELOC) alleged in the SOR. After \nApplicant established hardship, the creditor forgave the HELOC debt and issued an IRS  \nForm 1099-C (Cancellation of Debt) in tax year 2015. Applicant discussed the HELOC \n\n \n2 \n \nand debt forgiveness with the investigator during his April 8, 2020 security clearance \ninterview. On about April 23, 2020, he gave the investigator a copy of the 1099-C, which \nwas appended to the summary of that interview.  \n \nCredit reports from December 2020, November 2021, and October 2022 were \nincluded among the Government exhibits admitted to the record. The 2020 credit report \ncorroborated the HELOC balance alleged in the SOR; however, it also reflected that \nApplicant had disputed the debt. The 2021 credit report reflected the dispute and a $0 \nbalance on the HELOC debt. The HELOC debt did not appear on the 2022 credit report. \nThose credit reports revealed no other delinquent debts. The Government included \nsummaries of Applicant\u2019s two April 2020 security clearance interviews and the appended \n1099-C among the exhibits admitted to the record. After the hearing, Applicant provided \ndocuments which demonstrated that he was then living within his means and managing \nhis finances responsibly.  \n \nI considered the applicable disqualifying and mitigating conditions, as well as the \nwhole-person concept. Specifically, I find that the mitigating conditions under Guideline F \nAdjudicative Guidelines \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) and 20(b) were established by the record evidence. I \nconclude that Applicant has met his burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant him eligibility for access to \nclassified information. Clearance is granted.  \n \n \n \nGina L. Marine \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n \n",

He requested the record remain open for \nreceipt of additional information. Applicant submitted Applicant Exhibits A through C in a \ntimely manner. Applicant\u2019s exhibits were also admitted without objection. DOHA received \nthe transcript of the hearing (Tr.) on November 4, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 30-year-old budget analyst with a defense contractor. He is single. \nApplicant has received a bachelor of arts degree. He is seeking to retain a security \nclearance in connection with his work with the DoD. \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has used illegal drugs. Applicant admitted all three allegations under this \nparagraph with explanations. \nApplicant has used marijuana during two separate periods.

I do not plan to use Marijuana in the future in order to keep my \nsecurity clearance access, especially since the nature of my most recent \nuse was infrequent.  \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct) \nThe Government alleges in this paragraph that Applicant is ineligible for clearance \nbecause he has engaged in conduct that shows poor judgment, untrustworthiness or \nunreliability. Applicant admitted both the allegations under this paragraph. \n2.a. The Government alleges in this subparagraph that the Applicant\u2019s drug use \nhistory, as set forth under Paragraph 1, above, is also cognizable under Guideline E. \n2.b As stated, Applicant filled out an e-QIP in November 2017. (Government \nExhibit 1.) Section 23 of the questionnaire asked Applicant about his drug use history. \nThat section asked whether Applicant had used controlled substances during the previous \nseven years. Applicant stated, \u201cYes.\u201d Applicant further explained he had used marijuana \nin 2009 and 2010, \u201cWhen I was in junior college I had tried it a couple times with friends \nand never after that.\u201d This statement was false in that Applicant had actually used \nmarijuana about ten times during his college years, ending in 2014. \nApplicant filled out a second questionnaire in October 2020. (Government Exhibit \n2.) In answering the same question in Section 23 about his drug use over the past seven \nyears Applicant again stated, \u201cYes.\u201d He further indicated that the usage extended from \n2009 to 2020. Applicant went on to explain, \u201cWhen I was in college I had tried it multiple \ntimes with friends and have smoked it occasionally in recent years.\u201d This was a more \naccurate statement of his use. The questionnaire also asked why he did not intend to use \nillegal drugs in the future. He stated, \u201cI would not want the previous usage to effect [sic] \nmy career advancement by not receiving a TS clearance.\u201d \nApplicant admitted that he made a conscious mistake on his initial e-QIP when he \nset forth the time of his usage incorrectly. He freely admitted this error in judgment at the \nhearing. (Tr. 29-36.) \nMitigation \nApplicant submitted a letter from his supervisor.

He is described as \na \u201cSuccessful Performer.\u201d (Applicant Exhibit C.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines (AG) list \npotentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires, \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14, requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, \u201cThe applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201cAny determination under \nthis order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national interest \nand shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSee also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nParagraph 1 (Guideline H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nThe security concern relating to Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse is set \nforth in AG \u00b6 24: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted \nin this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. (Emphasis in \noriginal.)  \nI have examined the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25 and especially \nconsidered the following: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition);  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution, or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position. \nApplicant used marijuana on an infrequent basis from 2009 to 2014. He used it \nthree times in 2019 and 2020, while he was employed in the defense industry and held a \nsecurity clearance. All of the stated disqualifying conditions apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 26 have also been considered: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug-involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility. \nApplicant used marijuana on an infrequent basis during two distinct periods of time. \nHe used it about ten times between 2009 and 2014. Applicant used marijuana three \nadditional times between 2019 and 2020. This latter use was due, in part, to Applicant\u2019s \nconfusion over the impact of the legalization of marijuana use in his state of residence. \nWhen Applicant filled out a government questionnaire in October 2020 he realized the \ncontinuing Federal proscription against such use. Applicant stated in his Answer that he \nintended to abstain from future drug use. He confirmed this statement during his \ntestimony. He shows a credible intent to avoid such conduct in the future. Viewing his \nminor marijuana use in the context of the whole person Applicant has mitigated the \nsecurity significance of his past drug use. Paragraph 1 is found for Applicant. \nParagraph 2 (Guideline E \u2013 Personal Conduct) \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Personal Conduct is set out in \nAG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 16. Three are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single guideline, \nbut which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; and \n(e) personal conduct or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s \npersonal, professional, or community standing. \nApplicant knowingly falsified material facts about his drug use history on a \nGovernment personnel security questionnaire in 2017. As stated, he used marijuana on \nan infrequent basis from 2009 to 2014, and three times from 2019 to 2020. The cited \ndisqualifying conditions apply. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 are possibly applicable to \nApplicant\u2019s conduct: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur. \nAs stated under Paragraph 1, above, Applicant\u2019s drug use was very infrequent, in \nthe past, and he evinces a credible intent not to use marijuana in the future. He has \nmitigated subparagraph 2.a. \nApplicant freely admitted that he made a major mistake in misstating his drug use \non the 2017 questionnaire. When filling out the 2020 questionnaire Applicant was fully \nforthcoming about his drug use. He also was truthful during an interview with a \nGovernment investigator in 2021. His voluntary admission on the second e-QIP and \nduring the interview were the only evidence the Government had to establish the extent \nof his former drug use, and alleviated any security significance of his prior falsification. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis conduct was an aberration in judgment that will not be repeated. Applicant has \nmitigated the security significance of his falsifications on a Government questionnaire in \n2017. Paragraph 2 is found for Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility for a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon \ncareful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant has mitigated his \nminor drug use and the falsification of his first security clearance application. His recent \nforthright disclosures minimized or eliminated the potential for pressure, coercion, or \nduress. Continuation or recurrence of similar conduct is unlikely. Overall, the record \nevidence does not create substantial doubt as to Applicant\u2019s present suitability for national \nsecurity eligibility and a security clearance. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.c: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a through 2.b: \nFor Applicant \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security \neligibility for a security clearance.

(AE F at 1-4, 6-10) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \n3 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.    \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(c) a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or \nlocal income tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired.\u201d The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and \n19(f) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \nDiscussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the mitigation section, infra.  \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \n \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nApplicant provided some important mitigating information. His family\u2019s income was \nsignificantly reduced when his spouse lost her employment outside their home in 2019. \nThis circumstance was beyond his control, and it adversely affected his finances. \nHowever, \u201c[e]ven if applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due \nto circumstances outside his [or her] control, the judge could still consider whether \napplicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with those financial \ndifficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing ISCR Case \nNo. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May \n25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd.

He did not \nprove that he maintained contact with the IRS and the state concerning filing his TYs 2017 \nand 2018 tax returns or that he worked diligently to timely file his tax returns and timely \npay his income taxes. He did not file his TY 2017 and TY 2018 federal and state tax \nreturns. He did not maintain contact with the creditors in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e. \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for TYs 2017 and 2018 \nand to timely pay any taxes due. A willful failure to timely make (means complete and file \nwith the IRS) a federal income tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal offense. \nTitle 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203, willful failure to file return or supply information, reads: \nAny person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority \nthereof to make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who \nwillfully fails to . . .  make such return, keep such records, or supply such \ninformation, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in \naddition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor . . . . \nA willful failure to make return, keep records, or supply information when required, \nis a misdemeanor without regard to the existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United \nStates, 317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States v. Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9th  Cir. 1973); United \nStates v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th  Cir. 1969); O\u2019Brien v. United States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th  \nCir. 1931). For purposes of this decision, I am not weighing Applicant\u2019s failure to timely \nfile his federal income tax returns against him as a crime. In regard to the failure to timely \nfile federal income tax returns when due, the DOHA Appeal Board has commented: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd.

See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 \nat 3 & n.3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d approach to an \napplicant\u2019s course of conduct and employing an \u201call\u2019s well that ends well\u201d analysis as \ninadequate to support approval of access to classified information with focus on timing of \nfiling of tax returns after receipt of the SOR). \nApplying the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence, SOR \u00b6 1.a is not mitigated because \nhe has not filed his TYs 2017 and 2018 federal income tax returns. Similarly, SOR \u00b6 1.b \nis not militated because he has not filed his state tax returns for TYs 2017 and 2018. He \nis not making payments to address any taxes that are overdue for those TYs. He is not \nmaking payment to address the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e or otherwise resolving \nthem. Under all the circumstances, he failed to establish mitigation of financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 36-year-old test technician who has worked for the same DOD \ncontractor since 2013. He has about 35 college credits. He served in the Marine Corps \nfrom 2007 to 2012. He served a tour in Iraq from October 2009 to February 2010. He was \nhonorably discharged as a sergeant. He has a 20 percent VA disability rating. He and his \nspouse are caring for three foster children, who are ages 6, 12, and 12. He has never had \nany security violations. He has not received any reprimands from his employer. \nApplicant received the following awards from the Marine Corps: Marine Corps \nGood Conduct Medal; Iraq Campaign Medal (w/1 Star); Certificate of Commendation \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n           \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Individual Award); National Defense Service Medal; Global War on Terrorism Service \nMedal; Sea Service Deployment Ribbon; and Sharpshooter Rifle Badge. On November \n17, 2021, Applicant completed the CORE Apprentice Certification. He received five award \ncertificates from his employer for accountability, and four award certificates for \ncollaboration. \nApplicant provided important financial considerations mitigating information. His \ndelinquent debts were affected by a circumstance beyond his control--his spouse\u2019s loss \nof her employment outside their home. He plans to file and pay his taxes and his \ndelinquent debts once his spouse obtains employment. \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is more substantial at this time. \nApplicant did not establish that he was unable to make greater progress sooner filing his \nfederal and state income tax returns for TYs 2017 and 2018 and to pay his federal income \ntaxes debt for those two years. He did not make any progress resolving the debts in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e. His failure to take prudent responsible actions raise unmitigated \nquestions about his reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information. \nSee AG \u00b6 18. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the record \ndiscloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo.12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more effort towards establishing a track record of financial responsibility, and a better \ntrack record of behavior consistent with his obligations, he may well be able to \ndemonstrate persuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person.

(Item 3) Applicant attended college courses, but she has not received a degree. She has held a security clearance since 2016. Applicant reports no military service. She is being sponsored by a defense contractor for a security clearance. (Item 5) In 2015, when Applicant signed her security clearance application, she was using the last name of Munoz. In 2020, when she obtained the services of the debt resolution company, she used the last name Munoz. The name Munoz appears to be her mother\u2019s last name. (Item 3) On Applicant\u2019s 2021 credit bureau report, her consumer name is Munoz and her other name is Coronel. (Item 8) From the record it appears that in 2022, Applicant\u2019s last name was Coronel. This last name is also on her 2022 credit bureau report. (Item 9) The files in this case reflect both names. Financial The SOR from December 2021, alleged that Applicant has about $29,961 in delinquent debt for 19 accounts, and a chapter 7 bankruptcy that was discharged in 2014.

The case was assigned to me on July 11, 2022. Applicant \nanswered the SOR, but provided no response to the FORM. Based on my review of the \ndocumentary evidence, I find that Applicant has not mitigated financial considerations \nsecurity concerns. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 39 years-old, divorced and has five children. (Item 2) She completed \na security clearance application on December 22, 2015. (Item 3) Applicant attended \ncollege courses, but she has not received a degree. She has held a security clearance \nsince 2016. Applicant reports no military service. She is being sponsored by a defense \ncontractor for a security clearance. (Item 5) \nIn 2015, when Applicant signed her security clearance application, she was using \nthe last name of Munoz. In 2020, when she obtained the services of the debt resolution \ncompany, she used the last name Munoz. The name Munoz appears to be her mother\u2019s \nlast name. (Item 3) On Applicant\u2019s 2021 credit bureau report, her consumer name is \nMunoz and her other name is Coronel.  (Item 8) From the record it appears that in 2022, \nApplicant\u2019s last name was Coronel. This last name is also on her 2022 credit bureau \nreport. (Item 9) The files in this case reflect both names. \nFinancial \nThe SOR from December 2021, alleged that Applicant has about $29,961 in \ndelinquent debt for 19 accounts, and a chapter 7 bankruptcy that was discharged in \n2014. (Items 1,7, 10) The allegations in the SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.t are supported by \nApplicant\u2019s 2020 and 2021 credit bureau reports. (Items 7, 8, 9) She admitted 15 of the \nSOR allegations and denied four alleged accounts. Applicant claimed in her answer to \nthe SOR that those accounts were paid. \nApplicant attributed her financial difficulties to a two income family reduced to \none income. Her husband at the time suffered a heart attack in 2015, and he could not \nwork for several months. Applicant became the sole provider and she used credit cards \nto pay household bills including rent and food. In 2016, Applicant\u2019s husband suffered \nanother heart attack. Applicant filed for divorce in 2020 and moved out of the house \nwith her five children. (Item 2) \nIn May 2019, a continuing evaluation (CE) report was issued to Applicant\u2019s \nemployer stating that Applicant had 13 delinquent accounts totaling $18,229. (Item 4) \nShe also had a $4,000 judgment against her. (Item 11) The judgment is the same as \nSOR allegation 1.o for $4,608. She then reported the judgment to her FSO. On January \n20, 2021, another CE report was issued to Applicant\u2019s employer. (Item 6) This CE report \nshowed $21,095 in delinquent debt which Applicant had not disclosed. (Item 6) At the \ntime, Applicant stated that she was utilizing a debt relief program.

(Item 2) The term was for 48 months. Applicant submitted the signed \nagreement and proof that she has paid $146 bi-weekly (as a program deposit amount) \nto the debt relief company since October 2020. Applicant was advised to stop paying all \ndebt so that settlement amounts could be negotiated. (Item 2) There were 15 accounts \nenrolled in the plan. \nApplicant submitted a screen shot of the four accounts that she denied in her \nanswer to the SOR (1.b, 1.d, 1.i, and 1.t), noting in her handwriting that those accounts \nwere paid in full. She did not state the amount of settlement for each of the accounts. \nHowever, her latest credit report reflects a payment on the four debts which amount to \n$5,746 (19% of the delinquent debts alleged in the SOR). (Item 9) Applicant claims that \nsettlement agreements have been reached on four other accounts, but she did not \nsubmit evidence to substantiate her claim. (Item 2) \nAs to the 2014 chapter 7 bankruptcy that was discharged in the amount of about \n$18,000 for consumer debt, she explained in her security clearance application that she \nwas not financially able to provide for her children and pay her previous debts. (Item 3) \nThe record reflects that Applicant has a total net monthly income of $2,800. Her \ntotal monthly expenses are $2,700. She has a monthly disposable income of $100. \n(Item 2) There is no record of financial counseling. (Item 2) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by her 2014 chapter 7 bankruptcy and \ncredit reports, establish two disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \n(\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d); and 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant admitted that she has not been able to pay her debts ($18,000) and \nhad to file for bankruptcy in 2014. Bankruptcy is a legitimate way to resolve debts, but \nsince 2014, Applicant acquired more debt. Applicant admitted the majority of the debts \nin her answer to the SOR. She does not receive full mitigation as she did not act \nresponsibly. Granted her husband had two heart attacks and could not work for a period \nof time which was beyond her control. However, she divorced him in 2020, and did not \nobtain the services of a debt relief company or address her undisclosed delinquent \naccounts until the issuance of the first CE report. She then disclosed the $4,000 court \njudgment to her FSO. \nApplicant obtained the services of the debt relief company after her first CE. She \nwas advised not to pay her debts by the company. This was a way to settle her debts \nfor less than she borrowed or charged and is not a sign of good-faith efforts to resolve \ndelinquent debts. \nApplicant waited to resolve debts until her security clearance was in jeopardy. \nThis does not show reliability or good judgment. Applicant has a history of financial \nirresponsibility. Applicant has recently paid or settled some debts, but is waiting for the \ndebt resolution company to settle the other delinquent debts on the SOR that are \nunresolved. She provided little evidence to prove that she has a track record of paying \nthe remaining delinquent debts. She has not sought financial counseling. Her \ndisposable income on a monthly basis is $100, but she has to pay $146 bi-weekly to the \ndebt relief company. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nBased on the scant evidence produced by Applicant, it is impossible to conclude \nshe made a sufficient good-faith effort to resolve her debts or that her financial situation \nis under control. The Government has cause to question whether Applicant has her \nfinances under control. Any doubts must be resolved in favor of the Government. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Because protection of the interests of \nnational security is the principal focus of these adjudications, any remaining doubts \nmust be resolved by denying eligibility for access to classified  or sensitive information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u20131.t: \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 35-year-old employee who is seeking eligibility for access to classified information for his job as a software engineer for a company in the defense industry. He has been so employed since January 2020. (Exhibit 3) His educational background includes a high school diploma awarded in 2004 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2009. He married in 2008 and divorced in 2012. His first marriage produced one child, but Applicant stated that his parental rights to the child were terminated in the divorce. (Exhibit 3 at 21) He married for the second time in 2017, and he and his spouse have a young child. Applicant has been continuously employed in the field of information technology since January 2012. (Exhibit 3) He was unemployed for about three months during 2011-2012 due to a relocation from Alaska to the continental United States. He has lived in his current state of residence since late 2011 or early 2012. The SOR alleges a history of financial problems consisting of four federal student loans in collection in amounts ranging from $3,840 to $9,816 for a total of about $28,000, and two minor medical collection accounts for $122 and $41. In addition to Applicant\u2019s admissions in his answer to the SOR, the six collection accounts are established by credit reports from November 2020 and April 2021. (Exhibits 6 and 5, respectively) In his security clearance application, Applicant disclosed the student loans. (Exhibit 3 at 41-42) He estimated owing a total of $70,",

Here, the SOR \ndetailed the factual reasons for the action under the security guideline known as \nGuideline F for financial considerations. \nApplicant answered the SOR on September 13, 2021. He admitted the factual \nallegations in the SOR and provided brief explanations. He requested a decision based \non the written record in lieu of a hearing before an administrative judge. \nOn October 11, 2021, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material \n(FORM) in support of their case. It consists of Department Counsel\u2019s written brief and \nsupporting documentation. The FORM was received by Applicant, via his facility \nsecurity officer, on October 25, 2021. He did not submit a written response to the \nFORM. The case was received in the Washington Hearing Office on December 16, \n2021, and assigned to me February 3, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 35-year-old employee who is seeking eligibility for access to \nclassified information for his job as a software engineer for a company in the defense \nindustry. He has been so employed since January 2020. (Exhibit 3) His educational \nbackground includes a high school diploma awarded in 2004 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in \n2009. He married in 2008 and divorced in 2012. His first marriage produced one child, \nbut Applicant stated that his parental rights to the child were terminated in the divorce. \n(Exhibit 3 at 21) He married for the second time in 2017, and he and his spouse have a \nyoung child. \nApplicant has been continuously employed in the field of information technology \nsince January 2012. (Exhibit 3) He was unemployed for about three months during \n2011-2012 due to a relocation from Alaska to the continental United States. He has \nlived in his current state of residence since late 2011 or early 2012. \nThe SOR alleges a history of financial problems consisting of four federal student \nloans in collection in amounts ranging from $3,840 to $9,816 for a total of about \n$28,000, and two minor medical collection accounts for $122 and $41. In addition to \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his answer to the SOR, the six collection accounts are \nestablished by credit reports from November 2020 and April 2021. (Exhibits 6 and 5, \nrespectively) \nIn his security clearance application, Applicant disclosed the student loans. \n(Exhibit 3 at 41-42) He estimated owing a total of $70,000; he explained he defaulted on \nthe loans because of financial hardship incurred due to divorce and the relocation to \nand from Alaska; and he stated that he had completed a loan-rehabilitation program and \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwas making $450 monthly payments. He did not provide documentation showing \ncompletion of a loan-rehabilitation program or the monthly payments.  \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated the following concerning the student \nloans in collection: \u201cMy wife\u2019s job was eliminated due to COVID and we fell behind on \nsome bills. We have been catching up but these student loans are the last of a long list \nand were the lowest priority. We will be caught up on everything eventually.\u201d He has not \nprovided documentation of a payment history for the loans. I specifically find the four \nstudent loans in collection are not paid, settled, in a repayment agreement, cancelled, \nforgiven, or otherwise resolved. \nLaw and Policies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \nThere is no presumption in favor of granting, renewing, or continuing eligibility for \naccess to classified information.5 Under the Directive, the parties have the following \nburdens: (1) Department Counsel has the burden of presenting evidence to establish \nfacts alleged in the SOR that have been controverted; (2) an applicant is responsible for \npresenting evidence to refute, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts that have been \n1  Department of the Navy v.

The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . .. \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying \nconditions as most pertinent: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems or difficulties that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. \nSubstantial evidence shows Applicant has about $28,000 in collection for four student \nloan accounts. The disqualifying conditions noted above apply. \nAn applicant lives in the real world and can expect real-world problems, such as \ndivorce, unemployment, or some other setback. The security clearance process \nrecognizes that bad things may happen to good people and has a certain tolerance for \nthe possibility of human error and honest mistakes. But an applicant is still expected to \nkeep their house in reasonable order. In financial cases, keeping their house in order \nincludes providing a reasonable amount of documentation in support of their case to \nshow whatever steps and remedial actions they are taking to resolve their financial \nproblems. The security clearance process, like other large bureaucratic institutions such \nas banks, hospitals, universities, and insurance companies, does not run on word-of-\nmouth. It runs on documentation. \n6 Directive, Enclosure 3, \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.14 and E3.1.15 \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has not sufficiently explained, extenuated, or mitigated his history of \nfinancial problems. I have reviewed the mitigating conditions under Guideline F and \nconclude none are fully applicable. With that said, I am not concerned about the two \nminor medical collection accounts for less than $200 in total. Viewed individually or \ntogether with the student loan accounts, the medical collection accounts are so minor as \nto fall within the maxim of de minimis. The two medical collection accounts are resolved \nin Applicant\u2019s favor. \nThe same cannot be said for the $28,000 in collection for the four student loan \naccounts. Applicant has not provided documentation to establish the current status of \nthe accounts or a recent record of payment. I have considered the circumstances of \nApplicant\u2019s financial hardship due to the relocations to and from Alaska, the brief period \nof unemployment, and the divorce. Although not minor matters, those events occurred a \nnumber of years ago. He has been continuously employed in the continental United \nStates since January 2012, a period of about 10 years. He has had sufficient time and \nopportunity to initiate a good-faith effort to resolve the student loans, but he relegated \nthe indebtedness to a low priority. I also considered Applicant\u2019s statement concerning \nhis spouse\u2019s job loss due to the fallout from COVID, but he did not provide specific \ninformation, and I so do not give that information substantial weight. \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept. I conclude that he \nhas not met his ultimate burden of persuasion to show that it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest to grant him eligibility for access to classified information.  \nFormal Findings \nThe formal findings on the SOR allegations are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e \u2013 1.f: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \naccess to classified information.

(Id.) \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered eight exhibits, and Applicant did \nnot offer any exhibits because his computer crashed.

(Tr. 86; HE 4) \nLegal Issue \nDepartment Counsel moved to amend the SOR to add an allegation that Applicant \nfailed to timely file some of his federal income tax returns; Applicant objected due to lack \nof notice; and I denied the motion because Applicant did not have at least 15 days to \nprepare to address the additional allegations.

Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits and transcript.  \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted the SOR allegations in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.f. \n(HE 3) He denied that he owed the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, 1.d, 1.e, and 1.g. He also \nprovided mitigating information. His admissions are accepted as findings of fact. \nAdditional findings follow. \nApplicant is a 52-year-old software developer, and he has worked for his current \nemployer since 2016. (Tr. 6, 8) In 1988, he graduated from high school. (Tr. 7) In 1992, \nhe received a bachelor\u2019s degree, and in 2005, he received a master\u2019s degree in computer \nscience.

(Tr. 27) He \nwas fired from the mortgage company; however, he was not told why he was fired. (Tr. \n28-29) He was unemployed for about two months. (Tr. 29) He had to pay about $1,500 \nfor rent in one state, and he paid about $3,000 monthly for hotels in another state where \nhe obtained new employment. (Tr. 30-31) He was receiving $75 an hour at his new \nemployment. (Tr. 31) He withdrew about $58,000 from his 401(k) account in 2016. (Tr. \n31; GE 2 at 12) He believed his employer failed to honor a promise to pay him per diem \nwhile he was maintaining two residences in 2016. (Tr. 22; HE 3 at 2; AE 8) He also had \na 25 percent reduction in income. (HE 3 at 2) He paid for storage of about $400 monthly. \n(Tr. 35) \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges Applicant owes the federal government for delinquent taxes in \nthe amount of $18,224 for tax year (TY) 2016. \nThe following table reflects Applicant\u2019s federal income tax information. (AE 1) For \nTYs 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2019, and 2020 he provided IRS tax transcripts, and for TY \n2018 he provided a tax return. (AE 1; AE 2; AE 5) He filed his TY 2017 federal income \ntax return about one year late because he was unable to file electronically or online, and \nhe needed to file a paper copy of his tax return. (Tr. 40) He knew he would not owe taxes \nfor TY 2017, and he did not believe it was important to timely file his TY 2017 federal \nincome tax return. (Tr. 40) Some of his other tax returns were filed late because he was \nunable to file electronically. (Tr. 70) At some point, the IRS advised him that there is no \npenalty for filing a tax return late if no tax is due. (Tr. 80) He did not provide any evidence \nthat the IRS authorized him or taxpayers in general to file tax returns after their due dates \nif they believed no taxes were due. \nAmounts in the following table are rounded to the nearest thousand. The source \nfor the TY 2018 row is Applicant\u2019s tax return. (AE 2) The sources for the other rows are \nhis IRS tax transcripts.

(Tr. 41; GE 3 at 23; GE 9) When Applicant \ncontacted the IRS on August 31, 2022, the IRS advised him he should refile his TY 2018 \nfederal income tax return. (HE 3) He plans to refile his TY 2018 tax return early in \nSeptember 2022. (Id.) I have credited Applicant with showing good faith in his efforts to \ntimely file his TY 2018 federal income tax return. No adverse inference is drawn from the \nfiling of this federal income tax return for TY 2018. \nApplicant\u2019s TY 2016 IRS tax transcript shows he owed $22,338 on August 30, \n2021, and he owed $18,801 as of September 2022. (GE 3; AE 5) His tax refunds for TYs \n2017, 2019, and 2020 were transferred to address his TY 2016 federal income tax debt. \nHis TY 2016 IRS tax transcript shows the following payments in 2021 and 2022: $352 \n(Nov. 8, 2021); $352 (January 5, 2022); $352 (February 14, 2022); $270 (April 15, 2022); \n$107 (April 15, 2022); $373 (May 20, 2022); $373 (June 21, 2022); and $373 (July 20, \n2022).

(GE 3) According to the IRS tax \ntranscript for TY 2016, on September 23, 2019, an installment agreement was established \nwith the IRS. (AE 5) On September 30, 2019, he paid $175, and on September 30, 2019, \nhe paid $225. (Id.) On May 2, 2021, the IRS removed him from the installment agreement. \n(Id.)

He conceded he failed to comply with a previous \nagreement with the IRS because he believed the monthly payment was too high. (Id.) He \nexplained the IRS wanted him to make monthly payments of at least $400, and he wanted \na lower monthly payment. (Tr. 34) Resolution of Applicant\u2019s tax issues was also delayed \ndue to understaffing at the IRS and the pandemic. (Tr. 42, 44-45) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges an account placed for collection for $713. This debt resulted \nfrom a dispute Applicant had with his landlord. (Tr. 48-51) Applicant delayed paying for \nthis debt because he disputed his responsibility for it.

In August \n2003, Applicant was fired his job, and his student loans became delinquent. (Tr. 21, 63-\n66; HE 3 at 8) He said he made some payments before his student loans became \ndelinquent. (Tr. 63-64) He did not provide documentary corroboration that he made these \npayments. He returned to college and received a master\u2019s degree in 2005. (Id.) He was \nunderemployed for 10 years. He said he tried \u201con multiple times, to reform that loan and \nto set up some kind of payment arrangement with my services. I was rebuffed doing that.\u201d \n(Tr. 21, 69) He said he attempted to rehabilitate the loan; however, the creditor wanted \nan initial payment of $20,000. (Id.) He did not provide any documentation showing the \ncreditor wanted an initial payment of $20,000 before he could begin repaying his student \nloan. The creditor threatened to garnish Applicant\u2019s wages, and then elected not to do so. \n(Tr. 68) Applicant believed his income was too low to warrant garnishment. (Tr. 69)  \nOn November 19, 2019, Applicant said his student-loan account was recently \ntransferred to the Department of Education (DoEd), and he intends to use the nine-month \nloan rehabilitation program to bring his loan out of default status. (HE 3 at 8) At his \nhearing, he estimated his student loan debt might be $90,000. (Tr. 62) He said some of \nhis debt or late charges might be waived it he completed a reform period.

(GE 8) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.    \n7 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the \nability to do so\u201d; \u201c(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(f) failure to file \nor fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income tax returns or failure to pay \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax as required.\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(b), 19(c), and 19(f). Further discussion of the disqualifying conditions and the \napplicability of mitigating conditions is contained in the mitigation section, infra.  \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements.  \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained an applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, \nthere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), \ncert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government presents evidence \nraising security concerns, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut or \nmitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The standard applicable \nin security clearance decisions is that articulated in Egan, supra. \u201cAny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for access to classified information \nwill be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 \n2(b).  \nApplicant indicated a circumstance beyond his control which adversely affected \nhis finances. He had periods of unemployment and underemployment. He moved to a \ndifferent state, and he had moving expenses that his employer failed to reimburse. \nHowever, \u201c[e]ven if [an applicant\u2019s] financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, \ndue to circumstances outside his [or her] control, the [administrative judge] could still \nconsider whether [the applicant] has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing \nwith those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, \n2007) (citing ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005); ISCR Case No. 99-\n0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 1, 1999)). \nA component is whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to \nnegotiate partial payments to keep debts current. Applicant did not provide supporting \ndocumentary evidence that he maintained contact with his student loan creditor over the \nlast four years. He is credited with maintaining contact with the IRS over the last four \nyears.  \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal income tax returns for TYs 2017, 2019, \nand 2020. He filed his federal income tax returns as follows: TY 2017 on August 27, 2019; \nTY 2019 on August 12, 2021; and TY 2020 on November 15, 2021. He made a good faith \nattempt to file his TY 2018 tax return on October 15, 2019, and no adverse inference is \ndrawn for the IRS not crediting him with filing his federal income tax return for TY 2018. \nThe SOR does not allege that Applicant failed to timely file any federal income tax \nreturns. In ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006), the Appeal Board \nlisted five circumstances in which conduct not alleged in an SOR may be considered \nstating: \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n(a) to assess an applicant\u2019s credibility; (b) to evaluate an applicant\u2019s \nevidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed circumstances; (c) to \nconsider whether an applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(d) to decide whether a particular provision of the Adjudicative Guidelines is \napplicable; or (e) to provide evidence for whole person analysis under \nDirective Section 6.3.  \n \n \n \n \n \nId.

See also ISCR Case No. 12-09719 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 6, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-00151 at 3, n. 1 (App. Bd. Sept. 12, 2014); IS\n \nCR \nCase No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006)). The non-SOR allegations will not be \nconsidered except for the five purposes listed above. \nA willful failure to timely make (means complete and file with the IRS) a federal \nincome tax return is a misdemeanor-level federal criminal offense. Title 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203, \nwillful failure to file return or supply information, reads: \nAny person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority \nthereof to make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who \nwillfully fails to . . .  make such return, keep such records, or supply such \ninformation, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in \naddition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor . . . . \nA willful failure to make return, keep records, or supply information when required, \nis a misdemeanor without regard to the existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United \nStates, 317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States v. Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9th  Cir. 1973); United \nStates v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th  Cir. 1969); O\u2019Brien v. United States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th  \nCir. 1931). For purposes of this decision, I am not weighing Applicant\u2019s failure to timely \nfile his federal income tax returns against him as a crime. In regard to the failure to timely \nfile federal income tax returns, the DOHA Appeal Board has commented: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C.

The Appeal Board \nclarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [his or her] \nfederal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated to prevent such \nproblems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant\u2019s security \nworthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility\u201d \nincluding a failure to timely file federal income tax returns. See ISCR Case No. 15-01031 \nat 3 & n.3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno harm, no foul\u201d approach to an \napplicant\u2019s course of conduct and employing an \u201call\u2019s well that ends well\u201d analysis as \ninadequate to support approval of access to classified information with focus on timing of \nfiling of tax returns after receipt of the SOR).   \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-01031 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016), the Appeal Board explained \nthat in some situations, even if no taxes are owed when tax returns are not timely filed, \ngrant of access to classified information may be inappropriate. In ISCR Case No. 15-1031 \n(App. Bd. June 15, 2016) the applicant filed his 2011 federal income tax return in \nDecember 2013, his 2012 federal tax return in September 2014, and his 2013 federal tax \nreturn in October 2015. He received federal tax refunds of at least $1,000 for each year. \nNevertheless, the Appeal Board reversed the administrative judge\u2019s decision to grant \naccess to classified information. \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) the Appeal Board \nreversed the grant of a security clearance, discussed how AG \u00b6 20(g) applied, and noted: \nThe timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who \nbegins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that \nhis clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat \nto his own interests. In this case, applicant\u2019s filing of his Federal income tax \nreturns for 2009-2014 after submitting his SCA, undergoing his background \ninterview, or receiving the SOR undercuts the weight such remedial action \nmight otherwise merit. \nApplicant has known about his delinquent tax debt of about $18,000 for TY 2016 \nsince April 15, 2017. He made some payments over the years and the IRS received his \ntax refunds for other TYs; however, there were also significant periods with no payments. \nApplicant filed his overdue federal income tax returns. He established a payment plan \nwith the IRS after he received the SOR. He has not established mitigation of his federal \nincome tax debt for TY 2016 because he was dilatory in his establishment of his payment \nplan. \nThe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b through 1.e, and 1.g are mitigated. These debts were \nless than $1,000 each and he resolved them. Applicant cited three security clearance \ncases he believed were similar to his case.

In ISCR \nCase No. 19-01208 (A.J. June 17, 2020), the administrative judge granted that applicant\u2019s \nclearance even though applicant filed tax returns late and defaulted on his student loans. \nThe judge noted: after filing his overdue tax returns he did not owe anything to the IRS; \nhe paid $6,000 to address his student loan debt in 2018; after August 2018, he made \ntimely payments of $675 monthly; and one student loan was forgiven. In ISCR Case No. \n19-01685 at 9 (A.J. Feb. 10, 2020), the administrative judge denied that applicant\u2019s \nsecurity clearance. In ISCR Case No. 19-02273 at 2 (A.J. May 19, 2020), the \nadministrative judge granted that applicant\u2019s security clearance and said applicant \u201cadmits \nthat he was behind in repayment of eight separate student loan debts totaling about $42,019. \nHe is now current with his student loan debts, and repayment is in deferment as Applicant is \nattending graduate school.\u201d The administrative judge did not provide enough history of that \napplicant\u2019s student loan payments to compare it to the Applicant\u2019s handling of his student \nloans in this case. The three cases Applicant provided are factually distinguishable from \nApplicant\u2019s case. \nApplicant is not credited with mitigating his student-loan debt in SOR \u00b6 1.f. He \nadmitted he did not voluntarily establish a payment plan for his student-loan debt before \nthe COVID-19 pandemic forbearance. The Fresh Start program he plans to utilize is not \nscheduled to begin until October 2022. \nComplete reliance on the COVID-19 pandemic-based student loans deferment to \nestablish mitigation for security clearance purposes is misplaced. Applicant\u2019s student \nloans were delinquent before Mary 2020. See ISCR Case No. 20-03208 at 2 (App. Bd. \nJuly 6, 2021); ISCR Case No. 20-01527 at 2 (App. Bd. June 7, 2021) (noting student \nloans totaling about $20,000 that were delinquent before the COVID-19 federal deferment \nmay be the basis for revocation of access to classified information). Applicant did not \nestablish he was unable to establish a payment plan and make some payments for \nseveral years before the federal deferment in 2020. See ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 \n(Aug. 25, 2015) (\u201cIndeed, even if a credit report states that a debt has been paid, that fact \nalone does not, in and of itself, resolve concerns arising from the dilatory nature of an \napplicant\u2019s response to his debts or other circumstances that detract from an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. In this case, the Judge commented on the absence of detailed \nevidence about how Applicant addressed his finances and reasonably had doubts about \nhis clearance eligibility based on that lack of evidence\u201d).  \nApplicant\u2019s history of non-payment of his federal student-loan debt has important \nsecurity implications.

Sept. 26, 2019) (citing ISCR Case No. 17-01256 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 2018)). \u201cA security clearance represents an obligation to the Federal \nGovernment for the protection of national secrets.

Under all the \ncircumstances, he failed to establish mitigation of financial considerations security \nconcerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept.

His \npayment plan established in 2022 to pay his TY 2016 federal income tax debt, and his \nefforts to establish a payment plan in 2022 for his student loan debt, in light of his financial \nresources, is too little too late to mitigate security concerns. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. Applicant\u2019s evidence did not overcome the Dorfmont \npresumption. \nThis decision should not be construed as a determination that Applicant cannot or \nwill not attain the state of reform necessary for award of a security clearance in the future. \nWith more effort towards establishing a track record of timely paying his taxes and his \nstudent loans, and a better record of behavior consistent with his obligations, he may well \nbe able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security clearance worthiness. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, \nthe AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and circumstances in the \ncontext of the whole person. Unmitigated financial considerations security concerns lead \nme to conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not warranted at this \ntime. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.b through 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.g: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On \nAugust 18, 2021, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guideline F. The CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on October 1, 2021, and requested a decision based \non the written record in lieu of a hearing.

Items 3 through 5 are admitted \ninto evidence. Although Item 5 was not authenticated as required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20, \nI conclude that Applicant waived any objection to Item 5. The Government included in the \nFORM a prominent notice advising Applicant of his right to object to the admissibility of \nItem 5 on the ground that it was not authenticated. Applicant was also notified that if he \ndid not raise an objection to Item 5 in his response to the FORM, or if he did not respond \nto the FORM, he could be considered to have waived any such objection, and that Item \n5 could be considered as evidence in his case. Applicant did not raise any objections in \nhis FORM response or otherwise. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 33, is married with four children, ages 12, 9, 7, and 2. He received \nhis high school diploma in 2007. He attended college from September 2007 through \nDecember 2008, without earning a degree. Applicant initially applied for a security \nclearance while employed as an inventory specialist by Defense Contractor A, from at \nleast June 2015 through March 2018 (when he signed his SCA). On dates not identified \nin the record, he became employed by Defense Contractor B (for whom he worked at the \ntime he received the SOR in October 2021), and then by Defense Contractor C (for whom \nhe worked at the time he received the FORM in December 2021), who appears to be his \ncurrent sponsor. He was reportedly granted a security clearance in 2015. (Items 2, 3, 4, \nand 6) \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant failed to file, as required, his personal federal and \nstate income tax returns for tax years 2015 through 2019, and that those returns remained \nunfiled as of the date of the SOR (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b). In his SOR answer, Applicant \ndenied both of the SOR allegations. (Items 1, 3) \nApplicant attributed his delayed filings largely to complications involving his \ngrandmother\u2019s estate after she passed away in April 2014. He and his brother were the \nsole beneficiaries and co-executors of her estate. Due to the nature of her estate, which \ninvolved multiple real estate investment properties and other assets, Applicant sought \nprofessional help to navigate the estate\u2019s administration and related tax obligations, \nincluding his own. He was advised to settle his grandmother\u2019s estate completely before \nfiling his personal tax returns. Her estate included an investment that paid out annually \nand could not be closed until the payout was completed. Applicant asserted that the first \naccountant (Accountant A) he hired was not reliable and charged an unfair amount for \nwork that was being completed late. Although the record did not specify for what period \nAccountant A was employed, Applicant had retained him or her by the time he was \ninterviewed in August 2018 in connection his background investigation (2018 Interview). \n(Items 3 \u2013 6; FORM response) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant retained a second accountant (Accountant B) in about November 2020 \nto assist him with filing his personal and the estate\u2019s returns. He filed by mail his personal \nreturns for tax years 2015 through 2018 on November 27, 2020, two days after receiving \nthem from Accountant B. They were received by the state on November 30, 2020, and \nthe IRS on December 1, 2020. He concurrently mailed the estate\u2019s returns for tax years \n2017 through 2019, which were received by the IRS and the state on November 30, 2020. \nThe record did not expressly confirm that Applicant filed his personal returns for tax years \n2019 and 2020 by the end of October 2021 as he promised in his SOR answer. However, \ngiven the information provided in his FORM response, it is reasonable to conclude that \nthose returns had been filed by the time he submitted it in January 2022. (Item 3; FORM \nresponse) \nAfter his negative experience with Accountant A, particularly given what he \nconsidered exorbitant fees involved, Applicant and his brother chose to handle the \nadministrative side of his grandmother\u2019s estate without professional guidance. Although \nhe acknowledged that there was a steep learning curve, he felt that saving such a \nsignificant amount of money for each yearly accounting was a financially responsible \nchoice. In his FORM response, he stated: \u201cI have still maintained the estate accounting \nand filing required by the county,\u201d making it unclear when or if his grandmother\u2019s estate \nhad settled. (FORM response; Item 6) \nBeginning with the self-report on his SCA and continuing throughout the security \nclearance adjudication process, Applicant detailed his ongoing efforts to resolve his tax \nfiling delinquencies. Although he provided some documents, his efforts to provide all \nrelevant \ndocuments \nwere \nhampered \nby \ncovid-related \nconstraints. \nApplicant \nacknowledged that he and his brother\u2019s decision to manage the accounting aspect of the \nestate themselves contributed to the filing delays. He stated: \u201cthere was a lot of confusion \nand misunderstanding as we taught ourselves how to submit the annual accounting.\u201d His \nattention was also divided by caring for his youngest child who was born in December \n2019 with special needs, and by the strict quarantine measures his family maintained in \norder to protect their young children from covid. (Items 3 \u2013 6) \nApplicant does not owe any delinquent taxes or other delinquent debt. He does not \nlive beyond his means, and the only debt he carries is a monthly car payment. In his free \ntime, Applicant enjoys being with his wife and children, including helping his wife with their \nshared passion for homeschooling their children. They had been homeschooling their \nchildren pre-covid as indicated by Applicant during his 2018 Interview.

As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 (App. Bd. \nApr. 20, 2016). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 \nat 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. (ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s failure to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for tax \nyears 2015 through 2019 establishes the following disqualifying condition under this \nguideline: AG \u00b6 19(f) (failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local \nincome tax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as required). \nHaving considered all of the factors set forth in AG \u00b6 20 that could mitigate the \nconcern under this guideline, I find the following relevant: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \nAG \u00b6 20(g): the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant failed to timely file federal and state income tax returns for five \nconsecutive years. He filed his delinquent returns for tax years 2015 through 2019 in \nNovember 2020, and for tax year 2019, by January 2022. \nApplicant\u2019s decision to take on the administrative tasks associated with his \ngrandmother\u2019s estate, regardless of whether it was financially responsible, was a choice \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand not a circumstance beyond his control. However, the complexities of the estate as \nrelates to tax obligations, Accountant A\u2019s unreliability, and the circumstances involving \nhis youngest child and the pandemic were circumstances beyond his control. In light of \nthose exigencies, Applicant filed his delinquent returns within a reasonable time period. \nIt is logical to assume that these same factors underlay his delay in administering the \nestate and filing the estate\u2019s returns, which in turn, contributed to the delay in filing his \npersonal returns. \nApplicant may have been better served by hiring another accountant to assist him \nwith the administrative side of his grandmother\u2019s estate, and by filing his personal returns \nwithout regard for the tax consequences associated with his grandmother\u2019s estate. \nHowever, his actions were not unreasonable or motivated by a willful violation of his legal \nobligations. Applicant\u2019s delay in filing the returns can reasonably be attributed \ncircumstances unlikely to recur. He initiated action to complete his delinquent returns \nbefore his 2018 Interview, and filed returns for four of the five delinquent tax years before \nthe SOR was issued. I have no lingering doubts about Applicant\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), and 20(g) are established to \nmitigate the Guideline F concerns alleged in the SOR. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis, \nand I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by \nhis failure to timely file federal and state tax income tax returns. Accordingly, Applicant \nhas carried his burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity to grant him eligibility for access to classified information. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

When Applicant answered the SOR allegations, she admitted the delinquent debts, but explained in response to the Guideline E allegation that it was a scam; that the impostor promised to pay off the credit-card debts that she incurred for him; and that he threatened her.

She took more than $60,000 in cash advances \nfrom credit cards in her name and wired the money or sent ITunes cards purchased with \nthe funds to a person whom she believed was an actor she admired. She defaulted on the \ncredit-card balances before she realized she had been scammed. In the absence of \nevidence showing she has been excused from her legal liability for repayment, more \nprogress is needed toward repaying her past-due debts. She displayed extremely poor \njudgment in compromising her personal information and financial stability.

On February 8, 2022, \nDepartment Counsel indicated that the Government was ready to proceed to a hearing. On \nFebruary 24, 2022, the case was assigned to me to determine whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance \nfor Applicant. I received the case file and assignment on March 1, 2022. \nAfter some coordination with the parties, on May 12, 2022, I scheduled a hearing for \nJune 7, 2022. At the hearing, the Government withdrew SOR \u00b6 1.f as a duplicate listing of \nthe debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k. Three Government exhibits (GEs 1-3) and four Applicant \nexhibits (AEs A-D) were admitted into the record without objection. Applicant testified, as \nreflected in a hearing transcript (Tr.) received by DOHA on June 23, 2022. \nI held the record open after the hearing for two weeks for additional documents from \nApplicant. On June 16, 2022, Applicant submitted wage garnishment documentation, which \nwas admitted without objection as AE E. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of October 27, 2021, Applicant owed \nseven charged-off debts for $12,164 (SOR \u00b6 1.a), $11,100 (SOR \u00b6 1.b), $1,038 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.c), $5.497 (SOR \u00b6 1.d); $3,281 (SOR \u00b6 1.g), $5,542 (SOR \u00b6 1.h). and $3,457 (SOR \u00b6 \n1.i); two collection debts for $5,753 (SOR \u00b6 1.e) and $8,218 (SOR \u00b6 1.j); and a past-due \naccount for $5,945 (SOR \u00b6 1.k). Under Guideline E, Applicant allegedly communicated \nfrom September 2017 to June 2018 with a person whom she believed was a well-known \nactor, and, at his request, sent him gift cards and money, and provided him with her Social \nSecurity number so that he could open credit-card accounts in her name resulting in the \ndelinquent debts (SOR \u00b6 2.a). \nWhen Applicant answered the SOR allegations, she admitted the delinquent debts, \nbut explained in response to the Guideline E allegation that it was a scam; that the \nimpostor promised to pay off the credit-card debts that she incurred for him; and that he \nthreatened her.

(GE 1.) She \nearned an associate\u2019s degree in May 1985. (GE 2.) She has worked as a \u201cPC\u201d technical \nspecialist for a defense contractor since January 2010. (GE 1; Tr. 16.) \nApplicant and her second husband divorced in June 2016 after almost ten years of \nmarriage. She moved into her current address in August 2016. She bought her \ncondominium outright with funds from her divorce settlement. (Tr. 32.) \nApplicant had a difficult time emotionally after her divorce. She obtained counseling \nand asserts that an actor helped her through that time in that she derived pleasure from \nwatching him act on a show that she enjoyed. (Tr. 18, 38.) \nIn approximately September 2017, Applicant began communicating via a social \nmedia messaging application with a person who identified himself as the actor, but who \nwas an impostor. Applicant responded that she would like to meet him, and he told her to \nmake a reservation through his agent. Applicant filled out a form electronically and sent him \n$3,000 through his purported agent. She withdrew the $3,000 from her 401(k) account. \nAfter several messages between them, Applicant was convinced she was communicating \nwith the actor. At the impostor\u2019s request, she procured and sent him several ITunes cards. \nShe willingly provided him with her address and Social Security number, which he used to \nopen credit-card accounts in her name for cards sent to her at her home address. She \nused the credit cards to purchase ITunes cards and obtain cash advances that she wired \nto the impostor at various addresses in the United States and abroad. The impostor \nrepeatedly promised to pay the balances on the accounts and did so initially, but some of \nhis payments were rejected for insufficient funds. (GE 2; Tr. 17-23, 31.) Given the actor\u2019s \nprofessional success, Applicant questioned the impostor about why he did not purchase his \nown ITunes cards. She does not now recall his response other than it was \u201csome \nnonsense\u201d to keep her believing that she would meet him. (Tr. 38.) She never asked what \nhappened to all the cash advances she sent. (Tr. 43.) \nThe impostor eventually proposed that he and Applicant start a clothing business \ntogether, and he told her he needed money for the start-up costs. (GE 2; Tr. 22.) Although \nhe never sent Applicant a business plan or told her how he would use the money, she \nobtained a home-equity loan for $37,647 against her condominium in January 2018 (GE 3), \nand wired around $37,000 to him. (GE 2; Tr. 24.) \nApplicant began to suspect that something was amiss because the impostor refused \nto send her a \u201cselfie;\u201d however, she continued to send him money and gift cards. (Tr. 19.) \nBetween October 21, 2017, and December 29, 2017, Applicant conducted 15 wire \ntransfers totaling $10,716 that were sent to addresses in the United States and abroad. \nBetween November 10, 2017, and January 6, 2018, she made 28 money transfers totaling \n$22,414 in amounts ranging from $400 to $1,000 to nine different people in the United \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nStates and abroad.

She used the credit-card account in SOR \u00b6 1.a for 27 \npurchases totaling $10,638, and obtained three cash advances totaling $2,205 between \nNovember 24, 2017, and January 8, 2018. (GE 2.) \nWhen the balances on the credit cards reached their credit limits (were \u201cmaxed \nout\u201d), the impostor stopped paying on them and refused to make any further payments. \nApplicant could not afford to pay them, and so she defaulted on the accounts.

I was a victim.\u201d (GE 1.) \nOn March 6, 2020, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). She provided details about the delinquent \naccounts on her credit record, including those incurred because of the scam. She \nexplained that she could not afford to repay them, and that should her attorney have little \nsuccess in having her debts forgiven, she might have to file for bankruptcy. Applicant did \nnot dispute the evidence of her wire transfers and purchases to U.S. and international \naddresses, which she indicated were at the impostor\u2019s request.

She has been current in making her monthly payment, \npresently at $411 per month, on the home-equity loan that she obtained to provide money \nand gift cards to the impostor. (GE 3; Tr. 32.) She leases a 2020 model-year vehicle at a \ncost of $356 per month. (Tr. 33.) \nApplicant told the impostor where she works but no details about her work.

Likewise, an engineer in the department, who has known her for \nabout eight years, indicates that Applicant is conscientious and dedicated to her job. She is \nwilling to stay late to ensure that an important task is completed.

Egan, 484\nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and\ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious\nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . .  \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nGuideline F security concerns are established when an individual does not pay \nfinancial obligations according to terms. Applicant defaulted on more than $60,000 in \ncredit- card and loan debts that she took on to wire money to, and purchase ITunes gift \ncards for, a person whom she believed was an actor she admired. Disqualifying conditions \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations,\u201d apply. \nApplicant bears the burden of mitigating her very questionable financial judgment. \nApplication of the aforesaid disqualifying conditions triggers consideration of the potentially \nmitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20. The following may apply in whole or in part: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay\noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nWithin the span of only a few months, Applicant opened the SOR accounts and \nincurred a significant amount of debt that went into default. Although more than four years \nhave passed since she incurred the debts, her ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a \ncontinuing course of conduct and are considered recent. See, e.g., ISCR 17-03146 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2018), citing, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-08779 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, \n2017). Applicant has made no payments on most of the debts in the SOR. AG \u00b6 20(a) \ncannot reasonably apply, even though the scam is an unusual circumstance that may not \nrecur. \nWhile AG \u00b6 20(b) provides for mitigation when a person is victimized by the \nfraudulent practices of another, Applicant bears significant responsibility for her financial \ndifficulties. She paid $3,000 withdrawn from her 401(k) to \u201can agent\u201d for what she believed \nwould be an opportunity to meet the actor. She used the credit cards opened in her name \nby an impostor to obtain cash advances or purchase gift cards for the impostor. In addition \nto taking on more than $60,000 in credit-card debts, she obtained a home-equity loan of \n$37,647 and sent most, if not all, of the money to him for a purported business venture. \nShe took out this loan against her own property without any evidence of a business plan. \nShe wired thousands to at least nine different people to addresses in the United States and \nabroad at the impostor\u2019s request without any reasonable explanation or justification. She \ncontinued to make money transfers and purchase gift cards, even as he refused to send \nher a \u201cselfie\u201d or speak to her. She took on more debt than she could afford to repay on her \nincome, based on little more than a hope that she would eventually meet the actor. These \nfinancially irresponsible actions are not mitigated under AG \u00b6 20(b). \nRegarding AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d), Applicant is currently trying to arrange for $35 \npayments to the creditor named in both SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.e. Available credit information \nshows that she paid down the balance of the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c from $1,038 to $210 by \nMarch 2021. There is no evidence that debt has been fully paid off. Even so, she made \nenough progress toward repaying that debt to resolve that debt in her favor. Her wages are \nbeing garnished involuntarily to repay the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i. While that debt may eventually \nbe resolved, the Appeal Board has long held that resolution through garnishment \n\u201cdiminishes the [mitigating] weight to which the evidence is entitled.\u201d See ISCR Case No. \n14-05803 (App. Bd. July 7, 2016), (citing ISCR Case No. 09-05700 at 4 (App. Bd. Feb. 24, \n2011)). Applicant has not made any payments toward the other debts in the SOR. Nor is \nthere any evidence that her creditors have forgiven the debts. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(d) have \nonly limited applicability. \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Appeal Board has held that the security clearance adjudication is not a \nproceeding aimed at collecting an applicant\u2019s personal debts. Rather, it is a proceeding \naimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness with regard to \nhis or her fitness or suitability to handle classified information appropriately. See ISCR \nCase No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. June 21, 2010). Applicant cannot presently afford to repay \nthe debts based on her income. She has about $80,000 in 401(k) assets, but has not \nconsidered a withdrawal to pay the debts. Whether or not some creditors choose to \ndischarge Applicant of her legal liability for repayment, it would not be enough to fully allay \nthe security concerns raised by Applicant\u2019s questionable financial judgment. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nThe security concerns about personal conduct are set forth in AG \u00b6 15, which \nprovides: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about \nan individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide \ntruthful and candid answers during national security investigative or \nadjudicative processes. \nPersonal conduct security concerns under AG \u00b6 15 are amply established. Applicant \nexhibited extremely questionable judgment in providing her personally identifiable \ninformation (PII) (Social Security number and address) to someone with whom she had no \npersonal relationship and with whom she had communicated only by messages or social \nmedia applications. Setting aside the issue of whether she should have paid $3,000 taken \nfrom her 401(k) for the opportunity to meet an actor whom she admired, neither her \nemotional vulnerability following her divorce nor her desire to meet the actor justify her \ncompromise of her PII and her financial security. She gave the impostor some $100,000 in \nmoney and gift cards without taking any reasonable steps to verify his identity or question \nhis motives. AG \u00b6 16(d) applies. It provides: \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other \nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but \nwhich, when combined with all available information, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nMoreover, Applicant\u2019s conduct triggers the personal conduct concerns contemplated \nwithin AG \u00b6 16(e), which states: \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct includes: \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s personal, \nprofessional, or community standing. \nApplicant showed an unacceptable level of vulnerability by the extent to which she \nwas duped into compromising her personal information and finances. She indicated during \nher OPM interview that her supervisor and some co-workers are aware that she fell for a \nscam. None of the three co-workers who provided character reference letters (AEs B-D) \nmention Applicant\u2019s involvement in a scam. It is unclear whether they know the full extent \nto which Applicant became involved in providing money and gift cards to the impostor. \nThree mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 17 could apply in whole or in part. They are: \n(c) the offense is no minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling to \nchange the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the stressors, \ncircumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, unreliable, or \nother inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate vulnerability \nto exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nAG \u00b6 17(c) warrants some consideration because four years have passed, but \nApplicant\u2019s conduct cannot reasonably be characterized as minor. It went on for months. \nAG \u00b6 17(d) has some applicability in that she regrets the actions she took which led to her \ncurrent financial stress, and she has taken steps to avoid recurrence by no longer \ncommunicating via messaging or social media applications with persons she does not \nknow. Even so, her reform appears to be incomplete. She sees herself primarily as a victim \nand demonstrates a lack of insight concerning her conduct and the choices she made. She \nhad no reasonable explanation for why someone whom she believed was a successful \nactor would need funds from her. She had multiple reasons to doubt the legitimacy of the \nrequests, if not the identity of the person asking for money. She never confronted him \nabout what he did with the money she sent or why he had her send it to multiple \ninternational destinations. \nApplicant\u2019s candid admissions about her delinquencies and her use of her personal \ncredit to satisfy the requests of the impostor provide some mitigation under AG \u00b6 17(e), \nalthough it is unclear to what extent her family, co-workers, and others in her life know \nabout her exercise of questionable judgment and financial stress. After evaluating her \nevidence in mitigation, it is not enough to overcome the personal conduct concerns. \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Those factors are: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nThe analyses under Guidelines F and E are incorporated in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under those guidelines, but \nsome warrant additional comment. \nApplicant asks that her security clearance not be jeopardized by a scam. However, \nshe clearly made questionable decisions that led to her compromising her PII and her \nfinances.  She needs her income to pay her living expenses.  The Directive does not permit \nthe administrative judge to consider the impact of an unfavorable decision on an applicant. \nSee, e.g., ISCR 18-01662 (App. Bd. May 6, 2019). It is well settled that once a concern \narises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is strong presumption \nagainst the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d \n1399, 1401 (9th  Cir. 1990). Based on the evidence of record, it is not clearly consistent with \nthe interests of national security to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for \nApplicant at this time. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \n12 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

He is seeking to \nobtain a security clearance in connection with his employment. \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe Government alleged that Applicant is ineligible for a clearance because he \nmade financial decisions that indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which raise questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect classified information. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant incurred two large delinquent debts owed to a \ncreditor on two accounts that were charged off totaling approximately $46,968. In his \nanswer, Applicant admits both of the allegations set forth in the SOR. Credit reports of \nthe Applicant dated September 26, 2020; May 5, 2021; and April 6, 2022, confirm that \nhe was once indebted to the creditor for both accounts listed in the SOR. (Government \nExhibits 3, 4, and 5.) \nApplicant served in the Air National Guard from July 1978 to December 1983. \nHe began his current employment in 1985. He started as a Warehouse Specialist and \nwas promoted to the position he now holds. Applicant applied for and received his first \nsecurity clearance in 2010. \nIn 2000, Applicant got married. At that time, he and his wife were both gainfully \nemployed, and shared the responsibility of paying the household expenses. Applicant\u2019s \nwife handles all of their financial matters, and pays all of the bills. In 2014, Applicant\u2019s \nwife lost her job. This impacted Applicant\u2019s ability to pay the bills. (Applicant\u2019s Answer \nto SOR.) \n1.a. Prior to his wife\u2019s lay-off, Applicant opened a credit card account or personal \nloan that he used to pay bills. When his wife lost her job, Applicant was unable to keep \nup with the payments on the personal loan, and by February 2016, the personal loan \nwas placed for collection. This account was eventually charged off in the amount of \napproximately $29,229. A judgment was entered against the Applicant by the creditor. \nApplicant\u2019s wages were garnished for collection of the debt.

(Applicant\u2019s Exhibit A.) \n1.b.  In 2014, Applicant opened another personal loan account for a flex credit \ncard to help with electrical bills and things his wife needed.   Applicant tried to keep up \nwith the payments for a period, but could not afford to continue it.  In 2016, the debt was \nplaced for collection, and eventually charged off in the amount of approximately \n$19,623.  A judgment was entered against the Applicant by the creditor.  Applicant\u2019s \nwages are currently being garnished in the amount of $493 per pay check for collection \nof the debt.  (Tr. p. 33-36.)  Applicant testified that he has approximately $4,000 left in \ngarnishment payments until he resolves the debt.  (Tr. p. 38, and Applicant\u2019s Exhibits B, \nC and F.)   \nApplicant testified that he has no other delinquent debts. \nHe and his wife \ntogether currently earn about $60,000 annually. (Tr. p. 44.) They have gone to credit \ncounseling to improve their spending habits, and to be more effective in budgeting their \nincomes. Applicant no longer eats out, but brings his lunch to work. His wife is now \nworking two jobs, working six to seven days a week at a hospital and a hotel. (Tr. p. \n40.) Applicant is current with his regular monthly payments of $424 towards his car \npayment. Applicant has incurred no new delinquent debt. (Tr. p. 41.) Although their \nfinances are tight now, once the remaining $4,000 in garnishment payment is \ncompleted, Applicant will have almost $500 extra a month that can be used to pay other \nexpenses.  (Tr. p. 43.) \nAnnual performance appraisals of the Applicant for the periods from 2020, 2021, \nand 2022 reflect \u201cgood performance\u201d and \u201chigh performance\u201d ratings. \nApplicant is \ndescribed as a hardworking, highly skilled, knowledgeable team leader. (Applicant\u2019s \nPost-Hearing Exhibit A.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to \npotential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F -  Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for Financial Considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. Two are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability or unwillingness to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant has a history of financial hardship brought on by his wife\u2019s loss of \nemployment, and spending beyond his means. \nHis actions or inactions both \ndemonstrated a history of not addressing his debt and an inability to do so. The \nevidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe following mitigating conditions under the Financial Considerations guideline \nare potentially applicable under AG \u00b6 20. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g. loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce, or \nseparation), and the individual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nApplicant has recently directed his focus at resolving his delinquent debts. He \nnow realizes the importance of being responsible and trustworthy in every aspect of his \nlife, including his finances. He has completely resolved one of his large delinquent \ndebts through payroll garnishment. He is currently resolving the second large debt \nthrough payroll garnishment that will be paid off in full fairly soon.

The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Applicant must continue \nto follow through with his commitment to show financial responsibility in the future, or he \nwill once again be in jeopardy of losing his security clearance and access to classified \ninformation. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I conclude Applicant has \nmitigated the Financial Considerations security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.  and 1.b. \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for \na security clearance.

She also has \nthree adult children from a previous marriage. Applicant has worked as a staff accountant \nfor her sponsor since April 2018. Prior to this, she worked in a similar capacity for another \ncompany from October 2009 to April 2018. (Item 3.) \nStudent Loans \nThe SOR alleged 10 delinquent student loans totaling $66,739. Applicant admitted \nthose allegations. (Items 1 and 2.) From August 2003 to May 2009, she took college \ncourses and earned her associate\u2019s degree. Except for four months in 2009 when she \nwas unemployed after a layoff, Applicant took courses while working full-time. In August \n2009, just before resuming full-time employment in October 2009, Applicant continued \ntaking college courses toward her bachelor\u2019s degree until December 2017. (Items 3 and \n4.) \nApplicant financed her college studies with student loans. Because she resumed \ncollege studies in August 2009, Applicant\u2019s loan repayments were deferred from then until \nDecember 2017, when she stopped her studies. In January 2018, Applicant was \ncontacted by the lender advising that her loans were in arrears. The lender asked that \nshe pay $600 per month. Because Applicant could not afford that amount, she did not \ncontest a July 2019 garnishment of wages of $300 per months. Applicant believed that \npayment covered all of her delinquent student loans. (Item 4.) \nApplicant has paid $300 per month from July 2019 until April 9, 2020, when student \nloan payments were suspended due to Covid-19. That suspension was to be lifted on \nJanuary 31, 2022. (Item 2.) On November 1, 2021, Applicant completed an ACH \nAuthorization Form making monthly payments of $730 to the lender beginning February \n5, 2022. In advance of that Authorization, Applicant made payments of $730 by check to \nthe lender on November 1, 2021, December 1, 2021, and January 3, 2022. On January \n11, 2022, Applicant completed a student loan Rehabilitation Agreement, which will (1) \nremove her student loans from default status; (2) make her eligible for remaining periods \nof deferment or forbearance, and; (3) make her eligible for new federal financial aid to \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreturn to school. (Applicant\u2019s Response.) The record does not indicate when Applicant\u2019s \nstudent loans will be paid off. (Item 4.) \nMedical Debts \nIn 2014 Applicant needed medical treatment and was treated until 2016. Before \ntreatment began, she applied for co-payment assistance. Applicant believed that \nassistance had paid her treatment bills, until she received court papers in May 2017 \nshowing she owed $1,200 to her provider. Applicant contacted her doctor and set up a \n$200 per month plan and paid that bill in full in June 2018. (Item 4.) \nBeginning in December 2011, Applicant incurred medical bills for her then minor \nstepchildren (ages 15, 16, and 18). In addition, between 2014 and 2016, Applicant \nunderwent three abdominal surgeries. As a result, she missed work, lost wages, and fell \nbehind on bills. Applicant\u2019s medical bills totaled $7,327. In June 2018, Applicant set up a \nplan to pay $200 per month to pay those bills. Applicant paid those bills in full in August \n2020 when she sold her house. (Item 4.) Applicant\u2019s most recent credit report shows all \nbut one medical bill (for $214) with zero balances due. (Item 7.) Applicant\u2019s medical \naccounts are not alleged in the SOR. (Item 1.) \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. \nAG \u00b6 2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national \nsecurity eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable decision.\u201d \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to Guideline F for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . .  \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nGuideline F notes conditions that could raise security concerns under AG \u00b6 19. \nThe following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe SOR debts are established by the Applicant\u2019s admissions and the \nGovernment\u2019s credit reports. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) apply. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuideline F also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquencies occurred recently and persist to this day. I cannot find \nthat AG \u00b6 20(a) applies. The next inquiry is whether AG \u00b6 20(b) or AG \u00b6 20(d) apply.  \nIt appears from the record that Applicant was current on her student loans until she \nstopped taking courses in December 2017. Not long after that, Applicant was contacted \nby the lender advising that her loans were in arrears and asking that she pay $600 per \nmonth. Because Applicant could not afford that amount, she agreed to a $300 per month \nwage garnishment in July 2019. From July 2019 until April 9, 2020, Applicant made the \n$300 monthly payments. On that latter date, student loan payments were suspended due \nto the Covid pandemic. That suspension was to be lifted on January 31, 2022. \nWhile continuing to make monthly student loan payments, Applicant was also \npaying off medical bills that she and her then minor stepchildren incurred between 2011 \nand 2016. Those bills totaled $8,527. Applicant made two payment plans to defray those \nbills. Under those plans, Applicant paid $200 per month to one provider and $200 per \nmonth to a second provider. In spite of missing work and losing wages for her own medical \nreasons, Applicant paid both bills in full in June 2018 and August 2020. \nIn light of the upcoming end of the student loan payment suspension in January \n2022, Applicant made three payments of $730 each to her student loan lender in \nNovember 2021, December 2021, and January 2022. Applicant also set up automatic \nmonthly transfers of that amount to her lender. Those steps qualified her for a student \nloan Rehabilitation Agreement that will remove her loans from default status and make \nher eligible for federal student loan financial aid. \nApplicant took meaningful steps to address her student loans. She was current \nuntil she stopped taking college classes. Applicant adhered to the wage garnishment, that \nshe did not contest. When the Government suspended her student loan payments, \nApplicant planned ahead and made pre-moratorium termination loan payments of $730 \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n      \n                                        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \nper month beginning in November 2021 and continuing with automatic payments. From \nMay 2017 and June 2018, applicant was also paying $400 per month to medical providers \nfor bills incurred by her and her children. She continued to pay one medical creditor $200 \nper month until August 2020. No doubt those medical payments strained her student loan \npayments. \nFor AG \u00b6 20(d) to apply, an applicant must show a meaningful track record of some \nform of debt repayment. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-13041 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 19, \n2008); ISCR Case No. 07-06482 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008). I find that Applicant showed a \nmeaningful track record of debt repayment. I also find that under the circumstances, \nApplicant handled her medical debts responsibly. I considered that fact as weighing in \nfavor of Applicant\u2019s mitigating and extenuating circumstances and as part of my whole-\nperson analysis. See ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006). I find that \nAG \u00b6 20(d) applies. \nIn addition, Applicant\u2019s medical debts impacted her student loan payments. Those \nmedical debts were caused by conditions largely beyond her control, and Applicant \nmanaged those debts and her student loan debts responsibly. Under AG \u00b6 20(b) the \nconditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control \n(e.g., loss of employment . . . unexpected medical emergency. . . .), and the individual \nacted responsibly under the circumstances. I find that AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. \nThe ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole-person concept. AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and (d)(1)-(9) (explaining the \n\u201cwhole-person\u201d concept and factors). In my analysis above, I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions and the whole-person concept in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. \nApplicant leaves me with no questions about her eligibility and suitability for a \nsecurity clearance. For these reasons, I conclude that Applicant mitigated the security \nconcerns arising under Guideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a.-j.: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant national security eligibility for access to \nclassified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with brief comments, all of the factual allegations pertaining to alcohol consumption (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.e.). He failed to address the one allegation pertaining to criminal conduct (SOR \u00b6 2.a.), and his silence in that regard is considered as a denial. Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: Applicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving as heavy equipment operator lead with his current employer since August 2015. He previously held identical positions with other companies since May 2008. His educational background was not reported. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in April 1987 and served on active duty until May 1996, when he was honorably discharged. He was granted a secret clearance in October 2012. He was married in 1998. He has one daughter, born in 2001. Alcohol Consumption and Criminal Conduct When Applicant completed his SF 86, he reported in Section 24 \u2013 Use of Alcohol, that in the last seven years, his use of alcohol had never had a negative impact on his work performance, his professional or personal relationships, his finances, or resulted in intervention by law enforcement or public safety personnel. He also denied ever seeking or receiving counseling or treatment related to his use of alcohol. (Item 3 at ",

On an unspecified date, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) issued him a set of interrogatories, and \nalso asked him to verify the accuracy of an investigator\u2019s summary of an interview.

The SOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to \ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nIn a signed statement, dated September 27, 2021, Applicant responded to the \nSOR and elected to have his case decided on the written record in lieu of a hearing. A \ncomplete copy of the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) was mailed to \nApplicant by DOHA on January 27, 2022, and he was afforded an opportunity, within a \nperiod of 30 days, to file objections and submit material in refutation, extenuation, or \nmitigation. In addition to the FORM, Applicant was furnished a copy of the Directive as \nwell as the Adjudicative Guidelines applicable to his case. Applicant received the FORM \non February 7, 2022. His response was due on March 9, 2022. Applicant chose not to \nrespond to the FORM, for as of March 25, 2022, no response had been received. The \ncase was assigned to me on April 12, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nIn his Answer to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with brief comments, all of the \nfactual allegations pertaining to alcohol consumption (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. through 1.e.). He failed \nto address the one allegation pertaining to criminal conduct (SOR \u00b6 2.a.), and his silence \nin that regard is considered as a denial. Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are \nincorporated herein. After a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, \nand upon due consideration of same, I make the following findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been serving \nas heavy equipment operator lead with his current employer since August 2015. He \npreviously held identical positions with other companies since May 2008. His educational \nbackground was not reported. He enlisted in the U.S. Army in April 1987 and served on \nactive duty until May 1996, when he was honorably discharged. He was granted a secret \nclearance in October 2012. He was married in 1998. He has one daughter, born in 2001. \nAlcohol Consumption and Criminal Conduct \nWhen Applicant completed his SF 86, he reported in Section 24 \u2013 Use of Alcohol, \nthat in the last seven years, his use of alcohol had never had a negative impact on his \nwork performance, his professional or personal relationships, his finances, or resulted in \nintervention by law enforcement or public safety personnel. He also denied ever seeking \nor receiving counseling or treatment related to his use of alcohol. (Item 3 at 30-31) He \ndid, however, report in Section 22 \u2013 Police Record, two alcohol-related incidents that \nresulted in law enforcement intervention and court resolutions. (Item 3 at 27-29) The two \nreported incidents, which are further discussed below, occurred in March 2014 and \nDecember 2019. \nApplicant first started consuming alcohol at some point after entering the military. \nHe characterized consuming alcohol as the social norm to hang out with friends who were \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndrinking and partying. While he was unable to quantify his alcohol consumption during \nthat period, he acknowledged that it was \u201cprobably a lot,\u201d and it frequently led to \nintoxication. Things changed after his discharge in 1996, essentially due to a new social \nenvironment, lifestyle change, and his own maturity. He generally consumed a beer on \nweeknights after work and about four or five beers on the weekend, generally while \nwatching football or socializing with friends. After his 2019 alcohol-related incident, \nApplicant and his wife discussed his alcohol consumption \u2013 a discussion that he \ncharacterized as a \u201cwakeup call\u201d \u2013 and he decided to make better decisions and choices, \nfocusing on scaling back on his drinking. Since those discussions, he reduced his alcohol \nfrom the four or five beers while watching football or socializing, to one or two beers. His \nreduced alcohol intake has had positive results: he is happier and more talkative. (Item 4 \nat 3-4) \nApplicant\u2019s relationship with alcohol has resulted in at least five separate alcohol-\nrelated incidents involving police and court authorities. Those incidents, admitted by \nApplicant in his Answer to the SOR, some of which were described in official court or \npolice documents, as well as by Applicant during his interview with an investigator from \nthe U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on December 9, 2020, are as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a.: On December 15, 2019, after consuming an unspecified number of \nbeers and mixed liquor over a couple of hours while watching football at a friend\u2019s house, \nApplicant drove himself towards his home, thinking he could do so safely. He was stopped \nby a police officer who saw him traveling north bound in a south bound lane. Applicant \ndescribed the incident as \u201ccrossing the center lane.\u201d The officer detected the \u201cfaint odor \nof an alcoholic beverage\u201d coming from Applicant. After failing the field sobriety tests, \nApplicant was arrested and charged with driving under the influence (DUI); open \ncontainer; and rules for driving on laned roadway. His wife paid approximately $1,500 in \nbail to have him released from jail. Applicant stated that although the court did not require \nthat he do so, he voluntarily attended DUI school and submitted proof of successful \ncompletion of the DUI school. (Item 2; Item 3; Item 5) \nOn February 14, 2020, after the arresting officer failed to appear at an \nadministrative hearing without good cause, the Administrative Law Judge ruled that the \nRespondent (the State) had defaulted and was unable to meet its evidentiary burden. \nAccordingly, the Respondent\u2019s decision to suspend Applicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license, permit or \nprivilege to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle in the state was \nrescinded. The Respondent was reversed, and the case was dismissed. (Order of \nDismissal, attached to Item 2) A final decision with respect to the original charges \u2013 DUI; \nopen container; and rules for driving on laned roadway \u2013 was not reported. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b.: On March 30, 2014, after consuming what Applicant described as a \n\u201cgood bit\u201d of beers and mixed liquor over a couple of hours while watching football at a \nfriend\u2019s house, Applicant drove himself towards his home, thinking he could do so safely. \nHe was stopped by a police officer who determined that the radar had clocked Applicant \nat 52 miles per hour (MPH) in a 35 MPH speed zone. The officer detected the \u201cstrong \nodor of an unknown alcoholic beverage\u201d coming from Applicant. After failing the field \nsobriety tests, Applicant was arrested and charged with DUI and speeding. His wife paid \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napproximately $1,500 in bail to have him released from jail. (Item 2; Item 3; Item 6) The \nProsecuting Attorney added the charge of \u201cDUI alcohol less safe.\u201d (Item 7 at 5) \nOn May 10, 2014, after the arresting officer failed to appear at an administrative \nhearing without good cause, the Administrative Law Judge ruled that the Respondent (the \nState) had defaulted and was unable to meet its evidentiary burden. Accordingly, the \nRespondent\u2019s decision to suspend Applicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license, permit or privilege to \noperate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle in the state was rescinded. The \nRespondent was reversed, and the case was dismissed. (Order of Dismissal, attached to \nItem 2) On June 23, 2014, upon Applicant\u2019s plea of guilty to reckless driving, the other \ncharges were dismissed. Applicant was sentenced to 12 months of unsupervised \nprobation; payment of $1,315.00 in fines; and attendance and completion of DUI school. \n(Item 7) Applicant successfully completed the DUI school. On August 18, 2014.  \nOn March 23,1996, Applicant was stopped by the police and arrested \nand charged with DUI; no proof of insurance; and driving too fast for conditions. On May \n24, 1996, upon his plea of guilty to the DUI, he was convicted and sentenced to probation \nfor 12 months; fined $822.50; ordered to perform 40 hours of community service; and \nordered to spend one weekend in jail. The other charges were dismissed. (Item 2; Item \n8; Item 9) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d.: On April 8, 1995, Applicant was stopped by the police and arrested \nand charged with DUI. On April 28, 1995, upon his plea of guilty, he was convicted and \nsentenced to probation for 12 months; fined $627.00; and ordered to perform community \nservice. (Item 2; Item 8) \nSOR \u00b6 1.e.: On January 15, 1994, Applicant was stopped by the police and \narrested and charged with DUI. On January 18, 1994, the charge was apparently reduced \nto reckless driving. Upon his plea of guilty, he was convicted and fined $100.00 plus \nunspecified court costs.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor access to classified information. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d  \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)).  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994).) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to classified \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense \nbe a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 \n7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have based this \ndecision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to Applicant\u2019s \nallegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has or has not \nmet the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established for \nissuing a clearance.  In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those conclusions that \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nare reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I \nhave avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline G, Alcohol Consumption \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Alcohol Consumption is set out \nin AG \u00b6 21: \nExcessive alcohol consumption often leads to the exercise of questionable \njudgment or the failure to control impulses, and can raise questions about \nan individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nThe guideline notes a condition that could raise security concerns for Alcohol \nConsumption in AG \u00b6 22: \n(a) alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while under \nthe influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, or other \nincidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's alcohol \nuse or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use disorder.  \nApplicant acknowledged that from January 1994 until December 2019, he was \narrested at least five times, as alleged in the SOR, and charged with a variety of alcohol-\nrelated violations, with the one common charge being DUI, all of which appear to have \nresulted in convictions. Applicant argued that the charges were dismissed with respect to \nthe charges in 2014 and 2019, but his assessment is incorrect. As noted by Department \nCounsel, the Appeal Board has held: \nThe disposition of an arrest or a criminal charges in a manner that is \nfavorable to an applicant, such as dropping or dismissal of a charge, does \nnot preclude a Judge from finding the applicant engaged in the underlying \ncriminal conduct. . . . In cases of this nature, the key issue is an applicant\u2019s \ncriminal or dishonest conduct, not what actions law enforcement authorities \nmay have taken regarding that conduct. \n(CAC Case No. 16-01524 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 19, 2018) \nApplicant was convicted of the underlying charges, and because he had completed \nDUI school, and the arresting officer failed to appear before the Administrative Law Judge \nregarding the continued suspension of his driving privileges following both convictions, \nthose driving privileges were restored, but the convictions for the alcohol-related charges \nwere maintained. AG \u00b6 25(a) has been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 23 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Alcohol Consumption: \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(a) so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or \njudgment; and \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol \nuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and has \ndemonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations. \nAG \u00b6 23(b) applies. Applicant has candidly acknowledged that he has consumed \nalcohol to excess. Three of his alcohol-related incidents occurred while he was in the \nArmy, socializing relatively heavily with alcohol. As noted above, he indicated that things \nchanged after his discharge from the military in 1996. He claimed that the change was \nessentially due to a new social environment, lifestyle change, and his own maturity. For \n18 years, his modified alcohol input did not result in any further alcohol-related incidents. \nWhereas before, he generally consumed a beer on weeknights after work and about four \nor five beers on the weekend, generally while watching football or socializing with friends, \nthings changed. \nAfter his 2019 alcohol-related incident, Applicant and his wife discussed his alcohol \nconsumption \u2013 a discussion that he characterized as a \u201cwakeup call \u2013 and he decided to \nmake better decisions and choices, focusing on scaling back on his drinking. Since those \ndiscussions, he reduced his alcohol from the four or five beers while watching football or \nsocializing, to one or two beers. His reduced alcohol intake has had positive results: he \nis happier and more talkative. His new reduced relationship with alcohol has resulted in \nzero alcohol-related incidents since December 2019 \u2013 a period of 28 months. That period, \nwhen combined with his modified consumption, provide clear evidence of positive actions \nto overcome his alcohol problem. An additional positive indication of changed \ncircumstances is his candor in self-reporting the alcohol-related incidents to his employer, \nin his SF 86, during his OPM interview, and in his Answer to the SOR. \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Criminal Conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: Criminal activity creates doubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person's ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe guideline notes two conditions under AG \u00b6 31 that could raise security \nconcerns: \n(a) a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be \nunlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nMy discussion related to Applicant\u2019s Alcohol Consumption is adopted herein. \nApplicant was arrested, charged, and convicted on five occasions for alcohol-related \nincidents between 1994 and 2019. Based on the actions described above, AG \u00b6\u00b6 31(a) \nand 31(b) have been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions under AG \u00b6 32 that could \nmitigate security concerns arising from Criminal Conduct: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nBoth conditions apply. Appellant\u2019s criminal behavior essentially commenced in \nJanuary 1994 and continued until March 1996 \u2013 a period of about 27 months, and stopped \nat that point. It reemerged in March 2014 and was repeated in December 2019. There is \nno evidence of criminal conduct since December 2019 \u2013 a period of 28 months. After his \n2019 alcohol-related incident, Applicant had a \u201cwakeup call.\u201d The subsequent period \nwithout any other criminal conduct provides evidence of successful rehabilitation. The \npassage of 28 months without recurrence of criminal activity; compliance with the terms \nof probation; constructive community service; modified alcohol consumption; and the \nsuccessful completion of DUI school, are all positive factors. Applicant\u2019s criminal conduct \nno longer casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n8 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, 2006)) \nThere is some disqualifying evidence regarding Applicant\u2019s conduct. Applicant first \nstarted consuming alcohol at some point after entering the military. He characterized \nconsuming alcohol as the social norm to hang out with friends who were drinking and \npartying. While he was unable to quantify his alcohol consumption during that period, he \nacknowledged that it was \u201cprobably a lot,\u201d and it frequently led to intoxication. He generally \nconsumed a beer on weeknights after work and about four or five beers on the weekend, \ngenerally while watching football or socializing with friends. From January 1994 until \nDecember 2019, Applicant was arrested at least five times and charged with a variety of \nalcohol-related violations, with the one common charge being DUI, all of which resulted \nin convictions. \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. Applicant is a 53-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has been \nserving as heavy equipment operator lead with his current employer since August 2015, \nand he previously held identical positions with other companies since May 2008. He \nenlisted in the U.S. Army in April 1987, and served on active duty until May 1996, when \nhe was honorably discharged. He was granted a secret clearance in October 2012. \nApplicant candidly acknowledged that he had consumed alcohol to excess. Three of his \nalcohol-related incidents occurred while he was in the Army, but things changed after his \ndischarge in 1996. For 18 years, his modified alcohol input did not result in any further \nalcohol-related incidents. Whereas before, he generally consumed a beer on weeknights \nafter work and about four or five beers on the weekend, generally while watching football \nor socializing with friends, things changed. \nAfter his 2019 alcohol-related incident, Applicant and his wife discussed his alcohol \nconsumption \u2013 a discussion that he characterized as a \u201cwakeup call\u201d \u2013 and he decided to \nmake better decisions and choices, focusing on scaling back on his drinking. Since those \ndiscussions, he reduced his alcohol from the four or five beers while watching football or \nsocializing, to one or two beers. His reduced alcohol intake has had positive results: he \nis happier and more talkative. His new reduced relationship with alcohol has resulted in \nzero alcohol-related incidents since December 2019 \u2013 a period of 28 months. That period, \nwhen combined with his modified consumption, provide clear evidence of positive actions \nto overcome his alcohol problem. An additional positive indication of changed \ncircumstances is his candor in self-reporting the alcohol-related incidents to his employer, \nin his SF 86, during his OPM interview, and in his Answer to the SOR. \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                    \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nOverall, the evidence no longer leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all of these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has successfully mitigated the security concerns arising from his \nalcohol consumption and criminal conduct. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d)(1) through AG \n2(d)(9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline G: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.e.: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline J: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a.: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n10 \n",

    "summary": "Findings of Fact After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Under Guideline H, the SOR alleges that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about February 2015 until June 2020, and that he used marijuana from about February 2015 until June 2020 \u201cwhile holding a security clearance.\u201d In Applicant\u2019s undated answer to the SOR, he admitted both SOR allegations. (Items 1, 2) Applicant is 29 years old. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2015. He married in September 2015 and divorced in June 2020. He has no children. He has been employed by a federal contractor since May 2014, initially as an intern and subsequently as a full-time employee. He has held a security clearance since about July 2014. (Items 3 through 7) Applicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in July 2014. He certified that he had not illegally used any drugs or controlled substances in the previous seven years. He was interviewed by a government investigator on various dates from September 2014 to December 2014, and in September 2015. There is no indication illegal drug use was discussed by the investigator or Applicant during the background interviews.

The case \nwas assigned to me on February 9, 2022. \nFindings of Fact \nAfter a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make \nthe following findings of fact. \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleges that Applicant used marijuana with varying \nfrequency from about February 2015 until June 2020, and that he used marijuana from \nabout February 2015 until June 2020 \u201cwhile holding a security clearance.\u201d In Applicant\u2019s \nundated answer to the SOR, he admitted both SOR allegations. (Items 1, 2) \nApplicant is 29 years old. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2015. He \nmarried in September 2015 and divorced in June 2020. He has no children. He has been \nemployed by a federal contractor since May 2014, initially as an intern and subsequently \nas a full-time employee. He has held a security clearance since about July 2014. (Items \n3 through 7) \nApplicant completed a security clearance application (SCA) in July 2014. He \ncertified that he had not illegally used any drugs or controlled substances in the previous \nseven years. He was interviewed by a government investigator on various dates from \nSeptember 2014 to December 2014, and in September 2015. There is no indication illegal \ndrug use was discussed by the investigator or Applicant during the background \ninterviews. (Items 5, 6, 7) \nApplicant completed another SCA on January 8, 2021, and disclosed that he had \nillegally used marijuana from approximately February 2015 to June 2020 while \npossessing a security clearance. He described his illegal marijuana use as \u201cLess than \nonce a year, when there was marijuana at a group event. Very limited usage, and it has \nnever actually affected me\u2026. Someday if marijuana/[tetrahydrocannabinol] THC is fully \nlegalized, I may be more inclined to participate in some capacity.\u201d (Item 3 at 34-36) \nDuring a February 23, 2021 interview with a government investigator, Applicant \nconfirmed that he used substances containing THC from approximately February 2015 to \nJune 2020. He said that he smoked marijuana four times from approximately February \n2015 to June 2020, and consumed an edible containing THC in 2019. He stated that he \nsmoked marijuana about once a year at parties by taking one puff of marijuana as it was \npassed around. He said that he did not recall the specific dates he used marijuana, and \ndid not know who brought it to the parties. He also said that he legally purchased a \nchocolate bar containing THC from a state-authorized dispensary in 2019. He stated that \nhe was curious about what it felt like to be high, but had never experienced a high from \nhis marijuana/THC [hereinafter marijuana] use.

He stated that he did not intend to illegally use marijuana in the future, but \nmight if it was legalized under federal law. He said that he avoids situations where \nmarijuana may be used, and did not know if anyone he socializes with illegally uses drugs. \nHe has not participated in any drug counseling or treatment. (Item 4 at 4-5) \nIn his undated response to the SOR, Applicant admitted both SOR allegations. He \nstated that he had \u201cused marijuana very infrequently, maybe 5-6 times\u201d over a five-year \nperiod. He noted that he had \u201cno interest in seeking it out again, unless it were to become \na fully legal activity,\u201d and that it had been over a year since his last use. He also noted \nthat: \nI used marijuana while holding a security clearance. . . I will add that \nalthough I had a clearance, I have never had a reason to use it, and have \nno knowledge of any classified [government] information. If I were entrusted \nwith that information in the course of my work, it would be more important \nto me to protect that knowledge. \n(Item 2 at 2) \nIn his undated response to the FORM, Applicant again stated that he did not recall \nthe date he first used marijuana, but was certain that it was sometime after he graduated \nfrom college in May 2015. He stated that he had incorrectly estimated February 2015 as \nthe date of his first use in previous submissions, and said that he had never lied about his \ndrug use during an investigation including during the September 2015 background \ninterview. He averred that his self-reported drug use evidenced his truthfulness. (AE A) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d EO 10865. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and common sense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nIn reaching my decision, I specifically considered the following: \nThe Controlled Substances Act makes it illegal under Federal law to manufacture, \npossess, or distribute certain drugs, including marijuana. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 801, et seq. All \ncontrolled substances are classified into five schedules, based on their accepted medical \nuses, their potential for abuse, and their psychological and physical effects on the body. \n\u00a7\u00a7811, 812. Marijuana is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance, \u00a7812(c), based \non its high potential for abuse, no accepted medical use, and no accepted safety for use \nin medically supervised treatment. \u00a7812(b)(1). See Gonzales v. Raich, 545 U.S. 1 (2005). \nThe Director of National Intelligence (DNI) Memorandum ES 2014-00674, \n\u201cAdherence to Federal Laws Prohibiting Marijuana Use,\u201d October 25, 2014, states: \n[C]hanges to state laws and the laws of the District of Columbia pertaining \nto marijuana use do not alter the existing National Security Adjudicative \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGuidelines . . . . An individual\u2019s disregard of federal law pertaining to the \nuse, sale, or manufacture of marijuana remains adjudicatively relevant in \nnational security determinations. As always, adjudicative authorities are \nexpected to evaluate claimed or developed use of, or involvement with, \nmarijuana using the current adjudicative criteria. The adjudicative authority \nmust determine if the use of, or involvement with, marijuana raises \nquestions about the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nwillingness to comply with law, rules, and regulations, including federal \nlaws, when making eligibility decisions of persons proposed for, or \noccupying, sensitive national security positions. \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Abuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. Those that are potentially applicable in this case include: \n(a) any substance misuse;  \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or\nholding a sensitive position. \n \nApplicant admitted that he used marijuana with varying frequency from about 2015 \nto June 2020, and that he purchased and consumed an edible containing THC in 2019. \nUse of these substances is illegal under federal law. The fact that THC or marijuana may \nbe legal in a state where Applicant has lived or worked makes no difference, See ISCR \nCase No. 20-01772 (App. Bd.

AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n25(a) and 25(c) apply to Applicant\u2019s illegal drug use, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nAG \u00b6 25(f) does not apply. It is unclear from the record whether Applicant was \ngranted access to classified information when he used marijuana. Although he admitted \nthat he used marijuana from 2015 to 2020 while holding a security clearance, in his SOR \nresponse he noted that he had never had a reason to use the clearance and had no \nknowledge of any classified government information. Eligibility for access to classified \ninformation and the granting of access to classified information are not synonymous \nconcepts. They are separate determinations. The issuance of a security clearance is a \ndetermination that an individual is eligible for access to classified national security \ninformation up to a certain level. Security clearance eligibility alone does not grant an \nindividual access to classified materials. In order to gain access to specific classified \nmaterials, an individual must have not only eligibility (i.e., a security clearance), but also \nmust have signed a nondisclosure agreement and have a \u201cneed to know.\u201d See ISCR Case \nNo. 20-03111 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 10, 2022) \nAdditionally, SOR \u00b6 1.b alleges that Applicant used marijuana \u201cwhile holding a \nsecurity clearance,\u201d not \u201cwhile granted access to classified information,\u201d as stated in AG \n\u00b6 25(f) (emphasis added). As such, it does not allege the conduct identified in AG \u00b6 25(f). \nThe allegation does not allege any conduct that is not already alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a; it \nmerely pleads an aggravating factor that does not raise any additional disqualifying \nconditions. When the same conduct is alleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, \none of the duplicative allegations should be resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR Case \nNo. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005). SOR \u00b6 1.b is concluded for Applicant \nAG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns.

AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) and \n26(b) do not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case.

Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, \nbut some warrant additional comment. \nI considered that Applicant is now 29 years old and has been employed by the \nsame Federal contractor since 2014. However, it is well settled that once a concern arises \nregarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption \nagainst granting a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401. \u201c[A] \nfavorable clearance decision means that the record discloses no basis for doubt about an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 \n(App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case No. 12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, EO 10865, and the Directive \nto the facts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts about Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \nfor a security clearance. I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns \nraised under Guideline H, drug involvement and substance misuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nEric C. Price \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",
