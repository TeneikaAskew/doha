For reasons stated below, we affirm the decision. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had two delinquent vehicle loans totaling over $23,000, \nthat he had eight delinquent student loans totaling over $120,000, and that he failed to file his \nFederal and state income tax returns for 2013 and 2014 as required. The Judge found in favor of \nApplicant on a vehicle loan totaling about $7,700 and against him on the remaining allegations.  \nIn summarizing the case, the Judge stated: \nApplicant\u2019s financial hardships arose from a period of unemployment, \nsignificant medical expenses for his wife and special-needs child, and additional \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n       \n \nexpenses for his child\u2019s care. Notwithstanding these hardships, Applicant failed to \ndemonstrate good judgement and reliability in fulfilling his financial obligations to \ntimely file his tax returns and to address his delinquent debts. Applicant\u2019s recent \ndebt-resolution efforts do not mitigate the financial considerations security \nconcerns. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. [Decision at 1.] \nThere is no presumption of error below, and the appealing party has the burden of raising \nand demonstrating the Judge committed harmful factual or legal error. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n00-0339 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 22, 2001).  In this case, Applicant has failed to meet that burden. \nApplicant argues that the \u201cpossible indicators\u201d of security concern under Guideline \nF\u2015excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance misuse or alcohol abuse or \ndependence\u2015do not apply to him. Appeal Brief at 1, apparently referencing Directive, Encl. 2, \nApp. A \u00b6 18. To the extent that he is arguing his financial problems do not raise security concerns, \nwe do not find that argument persuasive. It is well established that a history of financial problems, \nan inability to satisfy debts, and a failure to file income tax returns as required may raise security \nconcerns under Guideline F. Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f). The Guideline F security concerns \nare broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly compromise classified \ninformation in order to raise money to satisfy his or her debts. Those concerns also encompass the \nrisk that applicants who are financially irresponsible might also be irresponsible, unconcerned, or \nnegligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-04112 \nat 3-4 (App. Bd. May 28, 2019).  \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant states he submitted three character-reference letters, and the \nJudge referenced only two of them in his decision. In a post-hearing submission, Applicant sent \nan email to the Judge and Department Counsel that contained eight attachments. Three of those \nattachments were identified as being possible letters of reference. In the decision, the Judge noted \nApplicant submitted nine post-hearing documents. The Judge apparently broke those documents \ndown and marked them as ten exhibits (Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AE) C-L). Decision at 2. Only two \nof those exhibits are letters of reference (AE F and G).  These are letters from Applicant\u2019s current \nmanager and a coworker. In his brief, Applicant does not identify the author of the apparent \nmissing letter, describe its contents, or otherwise explain its significance. More specifically, he \nhas not shown the purported missing letter reflects something different from the two letters in the \nrecord and is, therefore, something other than cumulative evidence. While a document may be \nmissing or may have been misidentified in the forwarding email, Applicant has failed to establish \nthat any error that may have occurred was harmful, i.e., an error that, had it not occurred, the case \nmight have been decided differently. Applicant also notes that the Judge erred in some findings \nregarding his children, but those errors were also harmless.  \nIn his decision, the Judge noted that Applicant testified all of his tax returns had been filed, \nbut also indicated that Applicant did not provide documentation to corroborate that his missing tax \nreturns were filed. In his appeal brief, Applicant argues proof was provided that his tax returns \nwere filed, but he does not cite to any specific record evidence supporting that claim. Based on \nour review of the record, we find no error in the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant did not provide \ndocumentary evidence to corroborate his claim that the delinquent tax returns were filed. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s remaining arguments amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of \nthe evidence. He argues, for example, that he is trustworthy and nothing in his lifestyle or activities \nwould indicate he is a security risk. He further indicates that he has never deliberately or \ninadvertently failed to safeguard classified information. Although an absence of prior security \nviolations is a matter that a Judge should consider, along with all the other evidence in the record, \nit does not preclude a Judge from concluding that an applicant\u2019s circumstances present security \nconcerns that remain unmitigated. The Government does not have to wait until an applicant has \ncompromised or mishandled classified information before it can deny the applicant a clearance. \nEven those with good prior records can encounter circumstances in which their judgment and \nreliability might be compromised. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-01131 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Apr. 19, \n2018). In short, none of his arguments establish that the Judge weighed the evidence or reached \nconclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Id. at 3. See also Directive \n\u00b6 E3.1.32.3. \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for \nthe decision. The decision is sustainable on the record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance \nmay be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

He was subsequently granted a security clearance in March 2009. In his January 2019 SCA, he disclosed past marijuana use, which he elaborated on in his April 2020 answer to the SOR and in his hearing testimony.

He used approximately two or three times per year until 2018, when recreational marijuana use became legal in his state. At that time, his use increased to approximately one to two times per month for a short period. He acknowledged that his use was a mistake and stated his intent not to use marijuana again. Applicant estimated that he used marijuana approximately 20 times after being granted a clearance in March 2009 until he stopped in December 2018. He acknowledged that his marijuana use was a violation of state and federal law, as well as his employer\u2019s drug use policy.

On \nMarch 12, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse) \nand Guideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as \namended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing, which was held on March 23, 2021. On \nJanuary 11, 2022, Administrative Judge Robert Tuider denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security \nclearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged that Applicant purchased and used marijuana from \nJune 2003 through December 2018 and separately alleged that Applicant purchased and used \nmarijuana after he was granted a security clearance in 2009. These same behaviors were cross-\nalleged under Guideline E. Under Guideline E, Applicant was also alleged to have falsified his \n2008 security clearance application (SCA) by failing to fully disclose his marijuana use.

Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact: The Judge\u2019s pertinent findings are summarized below: \nApplicant is in his late thirties and has been employed by a defense contractor since 2006.  \nDuring a security clearance interview in 2009, Applicant told the investigator that he stopped using \nmarijuana in 2007 because the drug no longer appealed to him and because he wanted to start a \ncareer. He was subsequently granted a security clearance in March 2009. \nIn his January 2019 SCA, he disclosed past marijuana use, which he elaborated on in his \nApril 2020 answer to the SOR and in his hearing testimony. Applicant estimated that he first used \nmarijuana sometime between 2003 and 2005.  He used approximately two or three times per year \nuntil 2018, when recreational marijuana use became legal in his state. At that time, his use \nincreased to approximately one to two times per month for a short period. He acknowledged that \nhis use was a mistake and stated his intent not to use marijuana again.  \nApplicant estimated that he used marijuana approximately 20 times after being granted a \nclearance in March 2009 until he stopped in December 2018. He acknowledged that his marijuana \nuse was a violation of state and federal law, as well as his employer\u2019s drug use policy.  \nIn December 2018, Applicant was preparing to submit a new SCA for his periodic renewal \nand decided to quit using marijuana, recognizing that \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have done it, and it was a poor \nchoice.\u201d  Decision at 3.  Applicant used marijuana with his wife in the past, and his wife still uses \nmarijuana, but Applicant stated that he is no longer tempted to use it.  \nApplicant called a co-worker as a character witness. She provided a favorable professional \nand personal assessment of Applicant, testifying to his trustworthiness and loyalty and highlighting \nthe fact that he self-reported the marijuana use. \nJudge\u2019s Analysis: The Judge\u2019s analysis is quoted below, in pertinent part: \nGuideline H \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use occurred after Applicant completed his \nDecember 2008 [SCA], after his March 2009 OPM interview, and after being \ngranted a security clearance in March 2009. \u201cAn applicant who uses marijuana after \nhaving been placed on notice of its security significance, such as using after having \ncompleted a clearance application, may be lacking in the qualities expected of those \nwith access to national secrets.\u201d ISCR Case No. 17-03191 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 26, \n2019) (citing ISCR Case No. 17-04198 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2019) (\u201cAn \napplicant\u2019s misuse of drugs after having been placed on notice of the \nincompatibility of drug abuse with clearance eligibility raises questions about his \nor her judgment and reliability\u201d).) Applicant\u2019s spouse and some of his friends are \nmarijuana users, and it is likely that he will be in the vicinity of marijuana in the \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfuture. It is too soon after his abstinence from marijuana use beginning in December \n2018, to rule out the likelihood of his future marijuana use. Guideline H security \nconcerns are not mitigated at this time.  [Decision at 7.] \nGuideline E \nApplicant continued to use marijuana after his initial disclosure of marijuana use \non his December 2008 [SCA], followed by his assurances to an OPM investigator \nin March 2009 that he stopped using marijuana in 2007 and wanted to pursue his \ncareer. Following these representations, he was granted a security clearance in \nMarch 2009 and used marijuana intermittently for a ten-year period while hold (sic) \na security clearance. He used marijuana knowing that it violated state and Federal \nlaw as well as company policy. Applicant is to be commended for self-reporting his \npast marijuana use and his assurances that he stopped using marijuana in December \n2018. However, those assurances ring hollow after ten years of infrequent \nrecreational marijuana use while holding a security clearance. [Decision at 9.] \nWhole-Person Concept \n[T]he mitigating weight of Applicant\u2019s disclosure is undermined by his marijuana \nuse after his March 2009 OPM interview. A 15-month period of abstinence from \nDecember 2018 to March 2021, the date of his hearing, is insufficient to overcome \na ten-year period of marijuana use while holding a security clearance and continued \nhis ongoing exposure to marijuana. [Decision at 10.] \nDiscussion \nFactual Error \nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s reference to his \u201c15-month period of abstinence\u201d from \nDecember 2018 to his hearing in March 2021. Decision at 10.  Applicant correctly states that the \nperiod from December 2018 to March 2021 is 27 months, not 15 months. He argues that the error \nimpaired the Judge\u2019s analysis of the recency of Applicant\u2019s security-significant conduct and that \nthe error was a \u201ckey point that led the Judge to his decision.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 1.   \nApplicant is not contending that the Judge\u2019s findings of fact are in error. In his findings of \nfact, the Judge referred consistently to Applicant stopping his marijuana use in December 2018, \nwhich Applicant does not contest. Applicant takes issue only with the sentence in the Judge\u2019s \nwhole-person analysis, quoted above, in which the Judge miscalculates or misstates the number of \nmonths Applicant was abstinent. \nReading the decision in light of the record, we conclude that this error was harmless, as it \ndid not likely affect the outcome of the case. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 10-01021 at 3 (App. Bd. \nNov. 18, 2011). As evident in the analysis sections excerpted above, the Judge focused almost \nexclusively on the following facts: Applicant assured the government investigator in 2009 that he \nhad ceased using marijuana; Applicant was then granted a security clearance; and Applicant \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n----\nnevertheless continued to use marijuana for the next ten years. The Judge\u2019s adverse decision rests \nsquarely on Applicant\u2019s \u201cten years of infrequent recreational marijuana use while holding a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d Decision at 9. Our review of the record and decision convinces us that the \nJudge\u2019s miscalculation of the months of abstinence did not likely affect his decision. \nDelay \nAt the close of the hearing on March 23, 2021, the Judge stated that he would issue a written \ndecision within \u201ca reasonable period of time after receipt of the transcript.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1, \nciting Tr. at 64. Applicant notes that he did not receive the decision until January 11, 2022, and \nargues that this delay of 294 days was not \u201creasonable.\u201d Applicant contends that the delay \nprejudiced him, because the weight of his testimony and his witness\u2019s testimony was diminished \nwhen the Judge considered the testimony \u201cafter such a lengthy period had passed.\u201d Id. \u201cI do not \nfeel the passion that I conveyed for my work, the trusting manner in which my witness talked about \nme, nor the sincere remorse for the Marijuana use was considered . . . .\u201d Id. at 1-2. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.25 requires that the Judge \u201cshall make a written clearance decision in a \ntimely manner[.]\u201d However, the Directive does not define the term \u201ctimely manner\u201d and does not \nimpose actual time standards on Judges. Despite his claim that the Judge failed to consider fully \nthe testimony at hearing, Applicant does not point to any testimony that was ignored or given short \nshrift. As we have previously stated, absent a showing that the Judge\u2019s delay in issuing a decision \ncaused an identifiable prejudice, mere proof of a delay is not sufficient to warrant remand or \nreversal of a Judge\u2019s decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-32581 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 9, 2005). \nOur review of the transcript and the decision confirms that the Judge captured the gravamen of the \ntestimony offered at hearing. Applicant has not established that any identifiable prejudice arose \nfrom the length of time the Judge took to issue the decision. \nIn conclusion, Applicant has not identified any harmful error in the Judge\u2019s handling of his \ncase or in his decision. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory \nexplanation for his decision. The decision is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is \nthat a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national \nsecurity.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nCarl Anthony Marrone, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nJune 9, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of Department \nof Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn September 9, 2021, after the hearing, Administrative Judge Nichole L. Noel denied Applicant\u2019s \nrequest for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s analysis of the \nevidence was flawed, resulting in a decision that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nConsistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had a charged-off mortgage loan of about $84,700, a home \nforeclosure in 2018, a delinquent bank debt of about $1,000, three state tax liens totaling about \n$105,000, and three Federal tax debts totaling about $315,000. The Judge found against Applicant \non two Federal tax debts totaling about $169,000 and for him on the other allegations. In \nresponding to the SOR, Applicant admitted the two tax debts for which the Judge entered \nunfavorable findings.  \nIn his brief, Applicant contends that his delinquent tax debts are not a sufficient basis for \ndenying his security clearance.  His brief states: \n[The Judge] found [SOR \u00b6\u00b6] 1.h and 1.i against [Applicant]. Both of these \nconcerns cite [Applicant\u2019s] indebtedness to the IRS for a sum of $169,821. This \ndebt, alone, is the basis for denying [Applicant\u2019s] security clearance. This is \ncontrary to the policy behind Guideline F. \nTo be clear, merely having debt (even a lot of debt) is not a security concern. \n. . . Rather, a close reading of Guideline F makes it clear that the Government is \nconcerned with granting access to classified information to people with: (1) a \nparticular condition (i.e., addiction, mental health problems, etc.); (2) a particular \nstate of mind (i.e., disregard for the law, unrealistic confidence about one\u2019s \nfinances, etc.); or (3) a particular vulnerability (i.e., susceptible to blackmail or \nmanipulation). \nThere is nothing in the record to suggest that [Applicant] has any concerning \ncondition, state of mind, or vulnerability. There is not a scintilla of evidence that \n[Applicant] has a problem with . . . alcohol, gambling, drugs, prostitution, or \nanything of the sort. There is a complete absence of information that [Applicant] \nhas problems with impulse control.  [Appeal Brief at 7.] \nThis argument lacks merit. Provisions of the Directive should not be construed in a narrow \nand artificial manner that does not adequately take into account the compelling interest of the \nUnited States in protecting and safeguarding classified information and the basic objectives of the \nindustrial security program. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-02195 at 5 (App. Bd. Apr. 9, 2004). A \nplain reading of Guideline F does not support Applicant\u2019s arguments. He is apparently focusing \non the second and third sentences of \u201cThe Concern\u201d paragraph for Guideline F and ignoring the \nfirst sentence, which reads: \u201cFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules \nand regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nand ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 18. His \ninterpretation of this guideline also ignores the clear language of the disqualifying conditions that \nthe Judge applied, i.e., that an applicant\u2019s \u201cinability to satisfy debts;\u201d \u201chistory of not meeting \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nfinancial obligations;\u201d and \u201c. . . failure to pay annual Federal . . . tax as required\u201d \u201ccould raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying[.]\u201d Id. at \u00b6\u00b6 19, 19(a), 19(c), and 19(f). Application of \nthose disqualifying conditions is not limited to applicants with addictions, mental problems, or \nother conditions/circumstances identified in Applicant\u2019s argument.  \nAn applicant\u2019s failure to meet his or her financial obligations in a responsible manner could \nindicate that he or she may be irresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and \nsafeguarding classified information. It is well established that one delinquent debt may raise \nsecurity concerns sufficient to deny a security clearance. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-05366 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Feb. 5, 2016). Furthermore, the Directive presumes there is a nexus or rational \nconnection between admitted or proven circumstances under any of its guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. Id. In this case, Applicant\u2019s delinquent tax debts are sufficient to \nraise Guideline F security concerns.  \nIn his brief, Applicant does not challenge any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact. \nInstead, he contends the Judge improperly analyzed the evidence. He argues \u201cit is impossible to \ndetermine the logic, appropriateness, and fairness of [the Judge\u2019s] approach.\u201d Appeal Brief at 3.  \nThis contention is not persuasive. In her analysis, the Judge noted that Applicant and his wife \nmismanaged their income tax obligations and lived beyond their means. \nAs a result, he \nexperienced financial problems that were not entirely beyond his control. Although he hired a tax \nattorney to assist him and has not incurred any additional tax delinquencies since 2018, he still \nowes $169,000 in delinquent Federal taxes for 2016 and 2017. \u201cWhile Applicant has demonstrated \nhis willingness to resolve his outstanding federal tax liability, the record does not contain a \nsufficient history of tax compliance or repayment of his outstanding federal tax debt to fully \nmitigate the alleged financial considerations.\u201d Decision at 7. The Judge\u2019s conclusions were \nreasonable inferences drawn from the record evidence. Based on our review of the record, there \nis no reason to conclude that the Judge\u2019s analysis was illogical, inappropriate, or unfair. A decision \nis not unfair merely because the Judge denied or revoked an applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility. \nThe balance of Applicant\u2019s argument amount to a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing \nof the evidence. He argues, for example, that the Judge erred by failing to consider important \nevidence and emphasizing unfavorable over favorable evidence.  He also claims that his financial \nproblems were attributable to his ex-wife and that, since separating from her, he has not had any \nfurther problems. An applicant\u2019s ability to argue for an alternative interpretation of the record \nevidence does not demonstrate the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions are erroneous. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 99-9020 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001). Applicant has not rebutted the presumption that \nthe Judge considered all the evidence in the record, nor has he shown the Judge weighed the \nevidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to the evidence. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020).    \nApplicant failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful errors. The Judge examined \nthe relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The decision is \nsustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \n\u2018clearly consistent with national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nJacalyn E. Crecelius, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nAugust 28, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision \u2013 security concerns raised under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior), Guideline E (Personal \nConduct), Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse), and Guideline J (Criminal \nConduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  \nApplicant initially requested a decision on the written record, but subsequently elected a hearing.  \nOn October 13, 2021, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nAdministrative Judge Edward W. Loughran denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleged marijuana use from 2007 to 2016 and one use of \npsilocybin mushrooms in 2016, including use of both substances while granted access to classified \ninformation. Under Guideline D, the SOR alleged solicitation of prostitutes on at least three \noccasions between 2015 and 2019.

Applicant admitted all allegations. The Judge found in favor of Applicant on the Guideline \nH, D, and J allegations and against him on the Guideline E allegations. The Judge\u2019s favorable \nfindings were not raised as an issue on appeal. \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge failed to properly \nconsider all available evidence, rendering his adverse decision arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to \nlaw. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is 32 years old. After securing his current job with a defense contractor in 2015, \nApplicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security Position (SF 86), in which he \nintentionally failed to disclose that he used marijuana between 2007 and 2009 and again between \n2014 and 2015. After receiving his security clearance in 2015, Applicant continued to use \nmarijuana irregularly. His last use of marijuana was in October 2016, at which time he also \nconsumed psilocybin mushrooms. Since that occasion, Applicant has used no illegal substances. \nIn July 2017, Applicant applied for a position that required a top secret clearance. In the \ncourse of that job application process, Applicant was alerted to the gravity of his continued drug \nuse and to his affirmative duty to self-report. He delayed reporting to his Facility Security Officer \n(FSO) in order to complete a project, but then self-reported in October 2017. \nIn November 2017, Applicant submitted another SF 86, in which he fully reported his \nillegal drug use, estimating that he used marijuana fewer than 20 times between 2007 and 2016. \nIn 2018, Applicant met with a background investigator, confirmed the drug use, and further \ndisclosed that he had paid for the services of prostitutes in Mexico in 2015 and 2016. In his July \n2019 response to DOD interrogatories, Applicant reported that he had engaged the services of a \nprostitute in Amsterdam the prior month.  \nPrior to his hearing, Applicant was evaluated by a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW), \nwith whom he discussed his substance abuse and encounters with prostitutes. She concluded that \nthere was no diagnosis and that Applicant was not at risk of relapse. Applicant\u2019s statements to the \nLCSW about his drug use and involvement with prostitutes were, in pertinent details, inconsistent \nwith his testimony at the hearing and his earlier disclosures.  \nThe Judge found in favor of Applicant on the Guideline D, Guideline H, and Guideline J \nallegations, concluding that the behaviors of concern were mitigated by the passage of time and \nunlikely to recur. Under Guideline E, however, the Judge found against Applicant on all \nallegations: his drug use and solicitation of prostitutes, his falsification of the 2015 SF 86, and his \nfailure to self-report drug use to his FSO: \nThere is a common thread running through Applicant\u2019s misconduct: poor judgment \nand dishonesty. He lied about his drug use on his SF 86, and then continued to use \nillegal drugs while holding a security clearance. He discussed his involvement with \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nprostitutes during his June 2018 background interview, and then he engaged the \nservices of a prostitute in Amsterdam in June 2019. He was less than candid in how \nhe reported his conduct to the LCSW during his evaluation, and I have good reason \nto question his credibility. While I believe that specific conduct (drugs, prostitutes) \nis unlikely to recur, I am unable to conclude that other problematic conduct is \nunlikely to recur. The . . . mitigating conditions are insufficient to overcome \nongoing concerns about Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, trustworthiness, and \nhonesty. [Decision at 10.] \nDiscussion \nApplicant has not challenged any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact. Rather, he \ncontends that the Judge erred in two regards: first, under Guideline E, he failed to apply the \nmitigation evidence that he considered favorably under Guidelines D, H, and J; and, second, he \nfailed to properly apply the whole-person concept. Consequently, Applicant argues, the Judge\u2019s \ndecision on the Guideline E allegations was arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. As an \nexample, Applicant argues that the Judge found the security concerns under Guidelines D, H, and \nJ to be mitigated in part due to the passage of time, but \u201crefused to use this pattern of reasoning\u201d \nwhen considering the Guideline E concerns. Appeal Brief at 8. Applicant contends that \u201c[p]er the \ndirective, the very mitigating circumstances included for Guidelines D, H, and J are also applicable \nto Guideline E.\u201d Id. However, it is well-established that a Judge may weigh the same evidence \ndifferently under different Guidelines. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-02483 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 11, \n2018). Moreover, a finding of mitigation under one Guideline does not compel a similar finding \nunder another.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 13-01281 at 4 (App. Bd.

In this case, the Judge\u2019s favorable conclusion under Guidelines D, H, and J \nrested on evidence that the drug use and solicitation of prostitutes was attenuated by time and that \nApplicant had matured and was unlikely to return to such behaviors. Under Guideline E, however, \nthe Judge focused on a \u201ccommon thread\u201d of poor judgment and dishonesty that ran through all of \nApplicant\u2019s misconduct, to include not only the drug use and solicitation, but a falsification and \nfailure to report. Decision at 10. This focus was reasonable, as judgment and candor are qualities \nexplicitly addressed under Guideline E. Applicant has not shown the Judge weighed the evidence \nin a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nBrittany D. Forrester, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nApril 10, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of that \ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of DoD Directive \n5220.6 (January 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive).  Applicant requested a hearing. On August 17, \n2022, after the record closed, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative \nJudge Robert Tuider denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged six financial concerns\u2014a failure to file Federal income tax returns for \ntax years 2012 through 2018, a failure to file state income tax returns for the same period, and four \ndelinquent consumer debts. The Judge found for Applicant on the four consumer debts and against \nApplicant on the Federal and state tax allegations. The favorable findings are not in issue. \nApplicant raises the following issue on appeal\u2014whether the Judge failed to properly consider all \navailable evidence, rendering his adverse decision arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nConsistent with the following, we affirm. \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is in his forties and married with two children. After serving on active duty in \nthe U.S. military, he has worked as a defense contractor for the past 16 years. He has held a \nsecurity clearance since the late 1990s. \nWith his Answer to the SOR, Applicant attached his Federal and state tax returns for tax \nyear (TY) 2018. At hearing, Applicant submitted his Federal and state returns for TY 2017. As \nof his hearing in June 2021, Applicant had not filed his Federal or state income tax returns for TYs \n2012\u20132016. \nPost-hearing, Applicant submitted an agreement with a professional tax service, which he \nentered into after his hearing, and his recently completed state and Federal returns for TYs 2012\u2013 \n2016. Additionally, Applicant documented two payments to the IRS in May 2021 that totaled \nabout $10,000. \nDuring his October 2019 security clearance interview, Applicant stated that he was unsure \nof the amount owed for his Federal and state taxes, that the state had garnished his wages for \ndelinquent taxes, and that he was in the process of contacting someone to assist him with his tax \nissues. \nApplicant was alerted to the fact that his failure to file these returns was a \nconcern to the Government during his October 2019 [security clearance interview] \nand later when he received his April 2020 SOR. These events apparently did not \nprompt Applicant to recognize the seriousness of his situation and take immediate \ncorrective action. He ultimately filed his Federal and state income tax returns; \nhowever, he did not begin to do so until the eve of his hearing and five of his returns \nwere not filed until after his hearing. His explanation of being scared to file his \nreturns and concerned about the amount he would owe is not a convincing \nexplanation for an individual of his age and experience. . . . The evidence \ndemonstrates that Applicant did not act responsibly with regard to timely filing his \nFederal income tax returns and paying or making payment arrangements for taxes \nowed.  [Decision at 9.] \nDiscussion \nApplicant has not challenged any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact. Rather, he \ncontends the Judge erred in failing to comply with the provisions in Executive Order 10865 and \nthe Directive by not considering all of the evidence, by mis-weighing the evidence, and by not \nproperly applying the mitigating conditions and whole-person concept. \nFirst, Applicant argues that the Judge \u201cfailed to adhere to the procedures required . . . when \nhe failed to consider all relevant evidence submitted by Appellant[.]\u201d Appeal Brief at 4. However, \ncounsel cites to no evidence that the Judge failed to consider. \u201cThe appeal brief must state the \nspecific issue or issues being raised, and cite specific portions of the case record supporting any \n2 \n\n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nalleged error.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.30. Applicant\u2019s counsel failed to comply with this fundamental \nrequirement and failed to carry his burden on this issue.       \nSecond, Applicant argues that the Judge misweighed the evidence and misapplied the \nmitigating conditions. For example, Applicant asserts that the Judge failed to give appropriate \nweight to his military service and to the fact that his wife does not work outside the home. Our \nreview of the record confirms that the Judge considered and discussed those matters, as well as the \nother matters raised by Applicant. None of Applicant\u2019s arguments are enough to rebut the \npresumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the Judge \nweighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Moreover, \nthe Judge complied with the requirements of the Directive in his whole-person analysis by \nconsidering all evidence of record in reaching his decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at \n2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). Although we give due consideration to the Hearing Office cases that \nApplicant\u2019s counsel has cited, they are neither binding precedent on the Appeal Board nor \nsufficient to undermine the Judge\u2019s decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02488 at 4 (App. Bd. \nAug. 30, 2018). \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that he should \nbe granted any relief on appeal. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a \nsatisfactory explanation for the decision.  The decision is sustainable on the record.  \u201cThe general \nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v.

On \nDecember 17, 2021, after considering the record, Administrative Judge Paul J. Mason denied \nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 \nand E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged two delinquent student loan debts totaling approximately $78,500, a child \nsupport arrearage of approximately $31,300, and six smaller delinquent debts totaling \napproximately $8,500.

The Judge found against Applicant on all \nnine allegations.  \nIn responding to the FORM, Applicant provided four letters from various collection \nagencies, each indicating that a specific account was paid or settled. Because the account numbers \nin the four collection letters did not clearly match the account numbers in the credit reports of \nrecord, the Judge was unable to determine whether any of the collection letters pertained to the \nalleged delinquent consumer accounts. In our review, we determined that one of the letters \nconfirms that Applicant satisfied the consumer debt listed at SOR \u00b6 1.d. in the approximate amount \nof $1,017.  We conclude that this error was harmless, as it did not likely affect the outcome of the \ncase, which alleged an aggregate debt of over $118,000. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01220 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 1, 2020). \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief makes no assertion of harmful error on the part of the Judge. \nInstead, Applicant asserts that he was given insufficient time to provide necessary documents \nduring the initial investigation, that he has paid all debts in full, and that he has the documents to \nprove payments on all accounts. The record before us contains no evidence of any time constraints \nthat may have been imposed during the initial investigation. However, it provides ample evidence \nthat Applicant was provided the requisite time to respond both to the SOR and the FORM with \nany documents that he wanted to have considered in the adjudication of his clearance. He \nresponded in a timely fashion to both the SOR and FORM, without requesting an extension. A \nreview of the entire record discloses no basis to conclude that Applicant was denied the rights due \nhim under the Directive. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-01237 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 5, 2017). \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for his \ndecision.

That country is a member \nof the United Nations, NATO, and the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS.  However, in recent years \ndemocracy in Turkey has deteriorated. There are locations there in which terrorist organizations \noperate, threatening U.S. interests.

He \nstates that the audio quality was poor and that the Judge had difficulty hearing and understanding \nwhat was being presented. We have examined the transcript and note several instances in which \nthe Judge or parties stated that an echoing effect made it difficult to hear. This problem persisted \ndespite the Judge instructing parties to mute their microphones. Tr. at 4, 10, and 51. However, \nthe court reporter advised that she was able to understand the parties and that the transcript \u201cwill \nbe okay.\u201d Tr. at 24, 52.  Applicant has not cited to any testimony that he believes was transcribed \nin error. We find nothing in the record to undermine the integrity of the transcript or to lead us to \nconclude that the Judge was not able to understand the hearing presentations. \nApplicant cites to U.S. policy against discrimination based upon national origin. However, \nwe find no reason to conclude that the Judge held as she did simply because Applicant was born \nin Turkey. Rather, her decision appears consistent with Directive, Encl., 2, App. A \u00b6 6, which \nrequires that in evaluating a Guideline B case, DoD officials \u201cconsider the country in which the \nforeign contact . . . is located\u201d and whether that country \u201cis associated with a risk of terrorism.\u201d \nGiven this policy and the record evidence, we find no reason to believe that the Judge\u2019s decision \nwas based upon matters beyond the scope of the Directive. After considering the record as a whole, \nwe conclude that Applicant was not denied the due process afforded by the Directive. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 15-04472 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 9, 2017). To the extent that Applicant\u2019s arguments \nconstitute an allegation that the Judge was biased against him due to his national origin, we \nconclude that he has not rebutted the presumption that the Judge was impartial. See, e. g., ISCR \nCase No. 18-02867 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2020). \nApplicant cites to a factual error concerning the date of his return to the U.S. in the early \n1990s. To the extent that the Judge\u2019s finding is in error, it did not likely exert an influence on the \noutcome of the case and, therefore, was harmless. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 3 (App. \nBd. Jan. 14, 2020). \nApplicant contends that his circumstances do not raise security concerns. Among other \nthings, he argues that the Judge did not identify any actual behavior by him that could make him a \ntarget; that his contacts with his family in Turkey are not unusual in that they result from his \nconcern over his parents\u2019 wellbeing; and that his contacts with them had been adjudicated years \nago without impairment of his access to classified information. We note first of all that Applicant \nadmitted the allegations in the SOR. The Directive presumes a nexus between admitted or proved \nfacts in an SOR and an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information.  See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 18-02581 at 4. When these admissions are considered in light of the evidence adduced \nat the hearing and the administrative notice material included in the record, we find no reason to \ndisturb the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant\u2019s contacts in Turkey entail a \u201cheightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure or coercion.\u201d Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \n\u00b6 7. The Government is not estopped from rendering an adverse clearance decision despite prior \nfavorable adjudications. This is especially true when there are changed circumstances that arose \nafter these earlier favorable determinations. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02867 at 2. In 2019, the \nDirector of National Intelligence noted, \u201cTurkey\u2019s regional ambitions, a distrust of the United \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nStates, and the growing authoritarianism of Turkey\u2019s leaders are complicating bilateral relations \n. . . .\u201d Item VI of Hearing Exhibit 1. In the case before us, the Judge\u2019s findings and administrative \nnotice information about the deterioration of the rule of law in Turkey, that country\u2019s relative \npolitical instability, and the presence of terrorist activity in Turkey support the Judge\u2019s conclusions \nabout Applicant\u2019s security concerns. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04208 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 7, \n2019); ISCR Case No. 19-00831 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 29, 2020).  \nApplicant cites to comments by the Judge that he believes are unwarranted, for example \nthat Applicant had in some way subjected himself to a risk of foreign influence. We do not \nevaluate a Judge\u2019s decision based on isolated sentences but, rather, on the decision viewed as a \nwhole.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-03778 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2017). We do not interpret the \ndecision before us as holding that Applicant has actually engaged in risky behavior. Rather, the \ndecision appears to rest on the nature and extent of Applicant\u2019s contacts in a country in which \nterrorist activity occurs and which practices human rights violations. The Government need not \nwait until an applicant has actually compromised classified information before it can withhold \naccess. See, e.g., ISCR Case No.18-02581 at 4.

On \nMay 15, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2015security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and Guideline E \n(Personal Conduct) of DoD Directive 5220.6 (January 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant \nrequested a hearing. On October 20, 2022, after the record closed, Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Carol G. Ricciardello denied Applicant\u2019s request for \na security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had seven delinquent debts totaling about $31,700 and that \nhe falsified three questions on a 2019 security clearance application (SCA). The Judge found \nagainst Applicant on three debt allegations totaling about $19,000 and the three falsification \nallegations.  \nFalsification Allegations \nThe three falsification allegations pertain to Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose on his 2019 \nSCA the following: (1) his 2016 arrest and charges for DWI and Unlawful Carrying Weapon, (2) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhis 2017 arrest and charges for Assault Causing Bodily Injury Family Member and Interfering \nwith Emergency Request for Assistance, and (3) his seven alleged delinquent debts. On appeal, \nas best we can discern, Applicant contends generally he supplied all requested SCA information \ntruthfully. Regarding the Judge\u2019s adverse determination on the delinquent-debt falsification \nallegation, Applicant asserts no specific assignment of error.  \nRegarding the criminal-conduct falsification allegations, Applicant states: \nI did not deliberately omit DWI, arrest for an alcohol-related offense, or unlawful \ncarrying of a concealed weapon as these charges were expunged. My legal counsel \nsaid, when the expungement was approved, all records (local and federal) of the \ncharges would be destroyed and obliterated. In short, these charges would not \n\u201cexist\u201d.  Therefore, I denied the charges. I was misinformed by my legal (sic) and \nthe court expungement documents.  [Appeal Brief at 1.] \nThis assignment of error lacks merit.  First, Section 22 \u2013 Police Record of the SCA begins \nwith the following sentence: \u201cFor this section report information regardless of whether the record \nin your case has been sealed, expunged, or otherwise stricken from the court record or the charge \nwas dismissed.\u201d Second and more on point, the Judge found that \u201cApplicant provided an \nexpunction [expungement] order dated November 22, 2021, for the state where he was arrested for \nthe May 2016 and December 2017 arrests. (Tr. 27; AE A)\u201d Decision at 4. Because the \nexpungement order was issued two years after Applicant submitted his 2019 SCA, it cannot \nlogically serve as a basis (i.e., a mistaken belief) for why he did not disclose the alleged arrests \nand charges in that document. \nIn the decision, the Judge concluded Applicant \u201cprovided contradictory statements on why \nhe did not disclose his arrests\u201d (Decision at 7), and \u201cI did not find Applicant\u2019s explanations for \nwhy he failed to disclose required information credible.\u201d Id. at 5. The Appeal Board is required \nto give deference to a Judge\u2019s credibility determinations. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. Applicant \nprovided no reason for why the Board should not provide such deference in this case and failed to \nestablish the Judge erred in her findings or conclusions pertaining to the falsification allegations.  \nDebt Allegations \nApplicant argues that he has made positive efforts to resolve his financial problems and \nthat those problems do not affect his ability to protect classified information. None of his \narguments are enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence \nor to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law.

Malone denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged that Applicant owed about $51,000 for 13 delinquent \ndebts; ten of those debts were student loans that totaled about $49,000. Under Guideline E, the \nSOR alleged that Applicant deliberately failed to disclose these 13 delinquent debts on his October \n2017 security clearance application (SCA).

Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact \nApplicant is in his early forties. Since about 2006, he worked for a series of defense \ncontractors. On three occasions, Applicant has been unemployed when his employers lost the \ncontracts to which he was assigned: for two months in 2007, for one month in 2010, and between \nOctober 2014 and March 2015.  He has been steadily employed since March 2015.  \nApplicant earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2006 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2014, funding \nhis studies with federally-subsidized student loans. He testified that he made payments on the \nstudent loans until about 2015, when he was unemployed, and has made no payments on his student \nloans in the past six years since then. When questioned about his failure to resume payments when \nhe regained employment, Applicant stated that he forgot about them.    \nWhen Applicant completed his SCA in October 2017, all of the delinquent debts alleged \nin the SOR were more than 120 days past due, in a collection status, or otherwise delinquent. \nApplicant did not list any of the debts or otherwise indicate that he had any financial problems. In \nhis background interview, he initially denied that he had any delinquent debts. When confronted \nwith the delinquent student loans, Applicant stated that he was paying them on a monthly basis. \nIn responding to the SOR, Applicant denied any intent to falsify and stated that he was confused \nby the financial questions. At hearing, he testified that he did not read the questions carefully or \ndid not pay attention to what was being asked.  \nIn March 2019, Applicant was again interviewed and stated that he intended to establish a \nrepayment plan. However, he took no action regarding his student loans until July 2021, the month \nprior to his hearing, by which time the ten loans totaled about $58,000. At that point, he enrolled \nin a student loan rehabilitation program, which will require him to pay $61 monthly for nine \nmonths to return his student loans to a current status. Prior to his August 2021 hearing, Applicant \nhad not made any payments, relying on the temporary relief for student loan payments provided \nby the Federal Government due to COVID 19. \nApplicant called four witnesses at his hearing who testified to his professionalism, \nreliability, honesty, and trustworthiness.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis \nRegarding the Guideline F allegations, the Judge concluded: \nNone of [the] mitigating conditions can be applied here. Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems are recent, in that, he still owes more than $58,000 in delinquent student \nloans . . . . He also owes another $3,000 for three commercial debts. All of the debts \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nalleged in the SOR have been delinquent for nearly five years, but Applicant only \nbegan to address his debts less than a month before his hearing. After last paying \non his student loans in 2015, he has yet to resume paying his debts despite being \nasked about his debts during interviews in 2018 and 2019 . . . . Even after he \nreceived the SOR in April 2020, he apparently took no action to resolve his debts. \nApplicant legitimately is excused under [Federal COVID relief] from making any \nstudent loan payments until 2022; however, this does not excuse the fact that he \nignored his debts for several years before the pandemic began. [Decision at 6.] \nRegarding the failure-to-disclose allegation, the Judge concluded: \nAll available information probative of Applicant\u2019s intent when he completed his \n[SCA] shows that he decided to ignore the questions about his past-due debts. His \nclaimed confusion about the question is not credible. His negative answers to those \nquestions were not the result of mistake or misunderstanding. Inaccuracies resulting \nfrom a knowing decision to gloss over those questions cannot be discarded as \nunintentional. At the very least, Applicant did not intend to provide the government \nall of the financial information in his background . . . . Also contributing to my \nassessment of Applicant\u2019s intent and credibility is the fact that he apparently lied to \na government investigator during his first interview when he claimed he was \nmaking monthly payments on his student loans. [Decision at 7\u20138.] \nDiscussion \nDebt vs. Delinquent Debt \nIn his brief, Applicant contends that debt alone does not render one unsuitable for a security \nclearance, noting that most people hold a mortgage. We concur that debt itself is typically not an \nissue. Instead, it is delinquent debt that raises a concern under Guideline F, as a failure to meet \nfinancial obligations \u201cmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide \nby rules and regulations.\u201d Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 18. Applicant argues that there must be \nother factors in play\u2015such as substance abuse, gambling, drugs, or prostitution\u2015for the debts to \nbe disqualifying. This position has no support in either the Directive or Appeal Board precedent. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-03940 at 2\u20133 (App. Bd. Jan. 10, 2022) for a lengthier discussion of \nthis issue. Financial problems, standing alone, may raise security concerns. The 13 delinquent \ndebts alleged in the SOR were a sufficient basis for the Judge to deny Applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility.  \nTiming of Payment Plan \nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s focus on the recent timing of Applicant\u2019s student loan \nrehabilitation plan. He argues that Guideline F is \u201ccompletely silent on the timing of efforts to \nrepay\u201d and that the Judge essentially created an additional requirement for Guideline F\u2019s mitigating \nfactors. Appeal Brief at 10. To the contrary, it is well-established that the timing of debt payments \nis a relevant consideration in evaluating whether an applicant has acted in a reasonable and \nresponsible manner in addressing financial problems.

The Appeal \nBoard has consistently held that a \u201cgood-faith effort\u201d generally requires that an applicant has \nestablished a meaningful financial track record of payments, to include evidence of actual debt \nreduction. See, e.g., ISCR Case 05-01920 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. 1, 2007). Promises of future \nrepayment are not a substitute for a history of payment. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04565 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 18, 2015). Moreover, an applicant who begins to resolve security concerns only \nafter having been placed on notice that his clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment and \nwillingness to follow rules and regulations when his personal interests are not threatened. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01256 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 2018). Given the facts that Applicant had \nmade no payments on his student loans since 2015 and entered into his rehabilitation plan the \nmonth prior to the hearing, the Judge appropriately focused on the timing of Applicant\u2019s efforts in \ndetermining that he had failed to mitigate security concerns under Guideline F.  \nMens Rea \nOn appeal, Applicant again asserts that his failure to disclose delinquent debts on his 2017 \nSCA was an innocent mistake and contends that there was no evidence to support the Judge\u2019s \ndetermination under Guideline E that he deliberately failed to disclose. \nA controverted \nfalsification allegation requires a Judge to make a finding as to an applicant\u2019s intent or state of \nmind when the alleged falsification occurred, in light of the record as a whole. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 14-04226 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). As a practical matter, such a finding may not \nalways be based on an applicant\u2019s statements concerning his intent but, rather, may rely on \ncircumstantial evidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-05850 at 4 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, 2013). \nHere, the Judge considered the state of the delinquent debt at the time Applicant completed \nhis SCA, his initial denial to the background investigator, his subsequent lie to that same \ninvestigator, and his continued \u201cconflicting and implausible explanations\u201d for his failure to \ndisclose. Decision at 8. We also note the Judge\u2019s adverse credibility determination; to which we \ngive deference. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. We conclude that the challenged finding is supported by \n\u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in \nlight of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02145 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 10, 2018). \nMisweighing the Evidence \nApplicant contends the Judge improperly analyzed the evidence, under-emphasizing the \nfavorable evidence and over-emphasizing the unfavorable evidence. In his arguments, Applicant \nhighlights his military service, attributes his financial problems to six months of unemployment in \n2014\u20132015, and notes he has never been involved in a security incident. In essence, Applicant\u2019s \nbrief argues for an alternative interpretation of the record evidence, which is not sufficient to \ndemonstrate the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions are erroneous. Applicant has not rebutted the \npresumption that the Judge considered all the evidence in the record, nor has he shown the Judge \nweighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to the evidence.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nRyan C. Nerney, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nNovember 9, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline D (Sexual Behavior) and Guideline E \n(Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive). Department Counsel requested a hearing. On November 9, 2021, after the hearing, \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Wilford H. Ross denied \nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 \nand E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline (GL) D, the SOR alleged that Applicant sexually molested his minor \nstepdaughter on multiple occasions between 2012 and 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.a.); sexually harassed his \nminor step-niece in 2014 (SOR \u00b6 1.b.); and sent a sexually suggestive email to an 18-year-old \nfamily friend in 2015 (SOR \u00b6 1.c.). Under GL E, the SOR cross-alleged the GL D allegations \n(SOR \u00b6 2.a.) and separately alleged that Applicant, in responding to DOHA interrogatories, \ndeliberately failed to disclose several additional complaints of child sexual abuse (SOR \u00b6 2.b.).  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nAlthough Applicant admitted in minor part to some allegations, he denied the gravamen of all \nallegations.  \nThe Judge found in favor of Applicant on two allegations under GL D (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b. and \n1.c.) and on the failure-to-disclose allegation under GL E (SOR \u00b6 2.b.). Those favorable findings \nwere not raised as an issue on appeal and are not discussed below. The Judge found against \nApplicant on the GL D allegation that he sexually molested his step-daughter and on the cross-\nalleged GL E allegation concerning the same behavior (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 2.a.). \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge failed to properly \nconsider all available evidence, rendering his adverse decision arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to \nlaw.  Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact \nApplicant is in his forties and married to his third wife. In 2017, he retired from the \nmilitary, having spent most of his active-duty career in his service\u2019s criminal investigative division.  \nFrom 2013 to 2015, Applicant was married to his second wife, RL. Her three children \nlived with the couple during the marriage. In the summer of 2015, after their divorce, RL reported \nto local law enforcement that her daughter EM had been sexually assaulted. This report of an \nalleged assault did not involve Applicant. When EM was subsequently interviewed, she initially \ndiscussed a recent sexual assault, but then disclosed sexual contact by the Applicant. The report \nstated in part: \n[EM] reported that her ex step-dad [sic], [Applicant], sexually abused her in 2014. \nShe stated that he touched her when her mom was out of town for work. [EM] \nreported that it happened more than one time. She stated that [Applicant] would rub \non her thighs and try to \u201cfinger\u201d her. [EM] reported that [Applicant] would rub her \ngenitalia on the inside and outside of her pants. [EM] reported that one time they \nwere watching a movie when [Applicant] put his hand in her pants. She stated the \n[Applicant] inserted his fingers on the inside of her vagina. [EM] reported that \n[Applicant] pulled his pants down, showed her his penis and asked her to touch it. \nShe stated that she told him \u201cno\u201d. . . . She indicated that there was another time \nwhere [Applicant] digitally penetrated her anally and vaginally. [EM] reported that \n[Applicant] looked at her, told her that he should not have done that and not to tell \nher mom. . . . [EM] reported that some of the incidents happened on the couch in \nthe living room. She stated that her siblings would be in their bedrooms. She stated \nthat she told her mom and [AM] . . . . She stated that he touched her on the inside \nof her pants when she would sleep in the bed with him. [EM] reported that \n[Applicant] told her he made a mistake and not to tell her mom. She stated that she \nstill told her mom. [EM] reported that [Applicant] and her mom convinced her that \nit was a dream and that it did not actually happen. She stated that the last time \nanything happened was while her mom was in the hospital which was around her \nmom\u2019s birthday. [EM] reported that her mom\u2019s birthday is October 12th 2014. \n(Applicant Exhibit R at 21-24).

The military initiated an investigation, during which they interviewed a \nnumber of EM\u2019s family and friends. Two teenaged girls told investigators that EM had previously \nconfided in them that her step-father had touched her inappropriately. During the course of the \ninvestigation, at least two persons interviewed called into question EM\u2019s truthfulness or her \nmother\u2019s truthfulness. \nAfter the military investigation closed, the service preferred charges against Applicant \nbased on EM\u2019s allegations: Applicant was charged with two counts of Sexual Assault of a Child \nand two counts of Sexual Abuse of a Child. At a preliminary hearing on the charges, EM did not \ntestify, but provided a written statement, in which she further described the incidents she had \nearlier disclosed and discussed a few other incidents of touching. The Preliminary Hearing \nOfficer, a senior judge advocate, submitted a report in which he concluded that there was probable \ncause to believe that Applicant committed the charged offenses. However, he recommended \ndismissal of the charges due to the difficulty in securing convictions in child sexual assault cases: \nOn the evidence before me, there is no reasonably [sic] possibility of success on \nthe merits. In the \u201cbest\u201d of circumstances, child sexual assault/sexual abuse cases \nare notoriously hard to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. There are numerous \ncircumstances here that will make it even more difficult. Though not uncommon \nnot to have third-party witnesses to such offenses, here neither EM\u2019s mother, \nyounger brother, younger sister, or [sic] adult household resident [AM] will provide \nany substantive information to corroborate EM\u2019s allegations. Thus, proof beyond a \nreasonable doubt will hang on EM\u2019s credibility. The Government will have a \ndifficult time establishing that as the Defense will likely subject EM to a devastating \ncross-examination. \n.  \n.  \n. \nThis analysis is not whether the offenses did or did not occur or whether EM is or \nis not telling what she believes to be the truth about. This analysis is simply an \nexperienced and objective overview of the difficulty of proving these allegations \nbeyond a reasonable doubt . . . . (Applicant Exhibit O.) [Decision at 6\u20137.] \nUpon receipt of the Preliminary Hearing Officer\u2019s Report, the legal advisor to the general court-\nmartial convening authority recommended that the charges be dismissed without referral to court-\nmartial.  The convening authority dismissed the charges and specifications in April 2017. \nThe following month, a military commander issued Applicant a letter of reprimand. The \nconduct for which Applicant was reprimanded is the same conduct alleged in the SOR. In June \n2017, Applicant was permanently disqualified from being a criminal investigative agent. Upon \nhis request, Applicant was approved for retirement shortly thereafter. \nLater in 2017, a state administrative law judge (ALJ) concluded that a state agency failed \nto show by a preponderance of the evidence that a particular penetration incident regarding EM \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \noccurred. The ALJ recommended that the record be expunged as to that allegation. The ALJ\u2019s \ndecision does not set forth the facts surrounding the particular allegation that she considered.  \nAt his security clearance hearing, Applicant \u201cabsolutely denied that any inappropriate \nsexual activity happened between him and EM.\u201d Decision at 7. He called two witnesses, both of \nwhom were friends. One of them was a retired criminal investigative agent who also knew RL \nand EM and testified negatively regarding their truthfulness. Evidence was introduced that RL \nhad made unfounded sexual misconduct allegations against another former husband. Applicant \nprovided letters from co-workers and documentary evidence about his military career. This \nevidence established that Applicant had a successful career and that co-workers continued to \nrecommend him for a position of trust even with knowledge of the allegations against him. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis \nApplicant has consistently denied that he engaged in criminal sexual activity with EM. \n\u201cHe submits that the decision not to try [him] in state court or by court-martial, evidence of RL\u2019s \nhistory of making false accusations, evidentiary issues with EM\u2019s reputation for veracity, and the \nfindings of the state . . . ALJ support his innocence.  I disagree.\u201d  Decision at 12.  \nA critical fact to consider is that EM did not initially go to the police to submit a report \nagainst Applicant. During the course of an unrelated investigation, EM revealed Applicant\u2019s \nmisconduct. \u201cIn other words, the predicate for the investigation was not the alleged conduct by \nApplicant.\u201d Id. \nEM described the incidents four separate times: to a teenaged relative, to a teenaged friend, \nto a clinical social worker, and in a written statement to the Hearing Officer. She described \nApplicant\u2019s conduct in detail. While there were inconsistent details, she was consistent on the \nbasic facts. Applicant argues that RL may have prompted her daughter to make a false report \nabout Applicant to the police, but that does not explain EM\u2019s disclosure to the two girls. \u201cThe \ndecisions of other tribunals have been viewed and considered by me, but are not controlling. Based \non the state of the record, I find that Applicant did engage in criminal sexual acts with . . . EM.\u201d \nId. \nUnder GL E, \u201cApplicant\u2019s conduct with his stepdaughter, as set forth above, shows \nextremely poor judgment. Applicant\u2019s failure to accept responsibility for it means it cannot be \nmitigated either as a minor incident, or due to the passage of time. [No] mitigating conditions \napply.\u201d Id. at 14. \nDiscussion \nApplicant argues that the Judge failed to properly consider all evidence, particularly \nevidence regarding the credibility of EM and RL, and that the evidence does not support the \nJudge\u2019s conclusion that he committed offenses against his stepdaughter. \nApplicant refers \nrepeatedly to three separate entities that investigated the allegations and determined either that \nApplicant did not engage in the misconduct alleged in the SOR or determined that there was not \nenough evidence to show that Applicant committed a crime.

Id. at 7.  \nHere, Applicant is both misconstruing the evidence of record and conflating the standards \nof proof. First, as to the evidence, the record does not establish that three separate entities found \nno misconduct. The police department\u2019s investigation was forwarded to the local prosecutor, who \ndeclined prosecution \u201cdue to inability to sustain a conviction.\u201d Applicant Exhibit Q at 1. The \nmilitary\u2019s criminal investigation was forwarded to a Preliminary Hearing Officer, who found \nprobable cause but \u2013 like his civilian counterpart \u2013 determined that it would be difficult to prove \nthe case beyond a reasonable doubt. Neither criminal investigation determined that Applicant did \nnot commit the offenses. Indeed, Applicant\u2019s commander issued him a letter of reprimand based \nupon the military investigation and permanently decertified him as a special agent. These adverse \npersonnel actions by Applicant\u2019s command, based upon its own criminal investigation, directly \ncontradict Applicant\u2019s assertion that the investigation cleared him of misconduct. \nTurning to the issue of the standard of proof, Applicant conflates the standard of proof at \ncriminal proceedings with the standard at his administrative hearing. The standard of proof in \nDOHA proceedings is not proof beyond a reasonable doubt, but instead is substantial evidence, \nthat is, \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a \nconclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d Directive E3.1.32.1. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 16-04094 at 2 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2018). A prosecutor\u2019s decision not to pursue \ncriminal charges because of evidentiary problems is not a determination of innocence nor does it \npreclude the Judge from concluding that Applicant engaged in such conduct. \u201cIn DOHA \nproceedings, a Judge can make a finding of criminal conduct even if the applicant has not been \nformally charged with a criminal offense by the relevant criminal justice authorities.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 03-04931 at 4 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2005). See also, ISCR Case No. 17-00506 at 3 (App. Bd. \nAug. 7, 2018) (\u201cEven if criminal charges are reduced, dropped, or result in an acquittal, the Judge \nmay still consider the underlying conduct in evaluating an applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility.\u201d). The Directive itself highlights that a security concern may arise from \u201csexual \nbehavior of a criminal nature, whether or not the individual has been prosecuted.\u201d Directive, Encl. \n2, App. A \u00b6 13(a). The Judge\u2019s \u201cunilateral determination\u201d that Applicant sexually abused his \nminor stepdaughter was well within his authority under the Directive. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n18-02018 at 3\u20134 (App. Bd. Nov. 4, 2021). \nApplicant argues that the Judge did not consider all of the evidence, misweighed the \nevidence, and did not properly apply the mitigating conditions and whole-person concept, \nrendering his conclusions arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. In deciding whether the \nJudge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law, we will review the \nJudge\u2019s decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate \na satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts \nfound and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of \njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02563 at 3\u20134 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, \n2015). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFrom our review of the record, the Judge\u2019s findings and his conclusion that Applicant \nsexually abused his minor stepdaughter are based on substantial evidence, to include the military \ninvestigation. We have previously stated that an employer\u2019s decisions and characterizations of \nevents are entitled to some deference in the context of an employer\u2019s internal investigation. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 18-00496 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 8, 2019). Such deference is particularly \nappropriate in this context, in which Applicant\u2019s law enforcement command relied upon its own \ncriminal investigation for its adverse personnel decisions. We find no error in the Judge\u2019s finding \nand conclusions, which are consistent with the command\u2019s stated reasons for reprimanding \nApplicant and removing his law enforcement qualifications and which are supported by other \nevidence of record. Moreover, we note that the Judge highlighted, discussed, and weighed the \nevidence regarding EM\u2019s reputation for truthfulness, as well as her mother\u2019s. Decision at 4, 5, and \n12. A party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a \ndifferent interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the \nevidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020). \nThe Judge\u2019s favorable findings on several unrelated allegations, following a detailed \nrecitation of facts and analysis, further demonstrate his thorough consideration of all the evidence \nin the record. Applicant has failed to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the \nrecord evidence, failed to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law, and failed to establish that he should be granted any relief. \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the \ndecision. The decision is sustainable on the record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may \nbe granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

On \nJune 17, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct) and Guideline F \n(Financial Considerations) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On September 14, 2022, after close of the record, \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Robert E. Coacher denied \nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 \nand E3.1.30. \nThe Judge found favorably for Applicant on the Guideline F allegations and adversely to \nhim on the Guideline E allegation. The Applicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether \nthe Judge failed to consider all evidence in mitigation, rendering his decision arbitrary, capricious, \nor contrary to law.

He served in the military \nin the 1970s, has earned a master\u2019s degree, and is working towards a Ph.D. He began working for \nhis current employer, a federal contractor, in 2018. He previously worked for federal contractors \nfrom 1993 to 2012. \nThe SOR alleges that, in December 2012, Applicant was debarred from a military \ninstallation where he both lived and worked. The debarment was based on an investigation into \npossible prostitution and illegal drug activities of his then-girlfriend (GF), who lived with \nApplicant at the time, and Applicant\u2019s involvement in those activities. \nApplicant met GF in about 2009 at a strip club where she worked as a dancer and began a \nnon-romantic relationship. GF was then married to a military member but separated and divorced \nsometime in 2011. \nIn December 2011, Applicant accepted a job on a military base in another part of the \ncountry. In January 2012, Applicant and GF commenced a romantic relationship, and he invited \nher to live with him. He secured base housing, and they moved to the base in January 2012. In \nMarch, GF began dancing at a local club. She asked Applicant for money to buy cocaine, and he \nprovided it. He also provided money for her to buy cocaine for the purpose of selling it. Applicant \nadmitted this conduct when interviewed by base law enforcement in August 2012. During his \nhearing, Applicant testified that he did not know at the time he gave GF the funds that she was \nusing them to buy drugs but instead came to realize that fact later. \u201cAfter reviewing the context \nof his August 2012 statement to law enforcement, I do not find his hearing testimony credible.\u201d \nDecision at 3.  \nWhile living in base housing, Applicant filmed GF dancing a strip tease to post on a \nwebsite. He also agreed to film GF and another man engaging in sexual activity, but they \nultimately were too drunk to film. Applicant believed that GF was engaging in prostitution in the \nlocal area and using his credit cards to pay for hotels.  In June 2012, Applicant and GF stayed at a \nhotel on travel. Applicant agreed to film GF while she engaged in sex in the hotel room with a \nsoldier. Applicant stated that he thought the soldier paid GF. Under cross-examination at the \nhearing, Applicant stated that he agreed to film because he was trying to get GF out of prostitution, \nand \u201cif it took her getting into the pornography business to do so, he was willing to help that \nhappen.\u201d Decision at 4. \nIn late June 2012, Applicant cut GF off financially. Concerned that she and her friends \nhad brought drugs into their base house, he notified base law enforcement and consented to a \nsearch of the house, which revealed no drugs. The ensuing investigation led to Applicant being \ndebarred from the base in October 2012. Applicant was not prosecuted by state or federal officials \nfor any violations of law. \nAt hearing, Applicant testified that he had improved his life in the subsequent 10 years by \nattending to his financial issues and pursuing his Ph.D. He has had no contact with GF since \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAugust 2012, other than one incident in which she reached out to him on social media. He told \nher to leave him alone and blocked her on the media platform.  \nApplicant was a co-participant or accessory to GF\u2019s illegal and questionable \nactions while they were together as a couple in 2012. These actions included \nengaging in prostitution, recording GF strip tease dancing in Applicant\u2019s base \nhousing, recording GF\u2019s sexual activity with a soldier, which Applicant believed \nwas an act of prostitution, and allowing GF to use his financial resources to buy \ndrugs and engage in prostitution. Applicant\u2019s active role in these criminal activities \nof GF shows questionable judgment, unreliability, untrustworthiness, and a \nvulnerability to exploitation. \n. . . \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s actions with GF happened approximately 10 years \nago and there is no evidence that they have happened since then, it is troubling that \na 53-year-old man who is well educated and has held a security clearance could be \nso influenced by a younger woman to allow himself to get involved in her nefarious \nactivities, some of which took place on a military base. . . . While Applicant has \nceased contact with GF, there is no evidence that he participated in any counseling \nto change his behavior. While some aspects of each mitigating condition apply, on \nthe whole because of Applicant\u2019s overall lack of good judgment, his actions are not \nmitigated.  [Decision at 6\u20137.] \nDiscussion \nApplicant has not challenged any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact. Rather, he \ncontends that the Judge erred in that he failed to consider all the evidence in mitigation and failed \nto apply the appropriate mitigating conditions. For example, he argues: \nThe Administrative Judge\u2019s decision fails to take into account all of the \nevidence presented, including evidence that [Applicant] admitted to his mistakes, \nvoluntarily reported his ex-girlfriend\u2019s conduct to the appropriate authorities, and \nhas not communicated with her in years. Furthermore, the evidence clearly \nestablishes that [Applicant\u2019s] criminal behavior has not recurred for approximately \nten (10) years and was not properly considered by Judge Coacher in his analysis. \n[Appeal Brief at 9\u201310.] \nThe Judge discussed all the particular matters that Applicant is raising on appeal, to include \nthe potentially applicable mitigating conditions. Applicant\u2019s arguments are neither sufficient to \nrebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record nor enough to \nshow that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary \nto law. Additionally, the Judge complied with the requirements of the Directive in his whole-\nperson analysis by considering the totality of the evidence in reaching his decision. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020).

The greater taxes due for TY 2014 were an \nunforeseen consequence of an early withdrawal from a 401(k) account to make a down payment \non the family home. For the other years, Applicant believed that his W-4 withholdings were \nsufficient to cover the federal and state taxes, but they were not. In the month prior to his hearing, \nApplicant learned from his attorney that\u2014although the withholdings that he and his wife \nestablished for their jobs appeared to be sufficient\u2014their earnings pushed them into a higher tax \nbracket in which their withholdings were insufficient (i.e., \u201cbracket creep\u201d).  \nDuring this timeframe, Applicant and his wife discussed increasing their withholdings, but \ntook no action to prevent the dramatic increase in the taxes they owed upon filing.  It appears that \nApplicant established a tax plan for TY 2013.  In his 2019 security clearance interview, Applicant \nalluded to payments made under a plan and, at hearing, Applicant referred to payment plans in \nplace during this timeframe. However, there is no evidence of payments under any plan during \nthis timeframe. \nApplicant testified that he discovered in 2017 or 2018 that his 2016, 2017, and 2018 federal \ntax returns were not filed and that he submitted the necessary documents to his tax preparer to start \nthe process. In March 2019, Applicant completed his security clearance application and disclosed \nthe above tax problems. He subsequently filed his 2016 through 2018 federal returns in June 2020. \nHe filed his 2019 and 2020 federal returns on time.  \nIn November 2020, Applicant entered into a payment plan with the IRS and made 11 \npayments under that plan. His ultimate goal was to take out a loan against his home to pay the \nentire delinquent IRS balance, but he first had to improve his credit score to qualify for the loan. \nApplicant has now submitted documents confirming that he has satisfied his federal tax liability \nfor TYs 2011 through 2020, the years alleged in the SOR. \nIn June 2020, Applicant also filed his 2016 through 2019 state tax returns. As of that date, \nhe owed approximately $11,900 for TYs 2014 and 2015. Applicant negotiated a repayment plan \nwith the state tax agency and began making monthly payments. By March 2021, Applicant had \npaid all state tax delinquencies. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJudge\u2019s Analysis: The Judge\u2019s analysis is summarized and quoted below, in pertinent part: \nAlthough Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file his federal and state returns was willful and \ntherefore criminal in nature, the criminal aspect of his conduct is not alleged in the SOR. Instead, \nApplicant\u2019s tax issues are alleged under the financial considerations guideline. Applicant\u2019s failure \nto file federal and state tax returns and his inability to pay his mounting delinquent income taxes \nfor a number of years establish security concerns under Guideline F. His federal and state tax \nproblems began in 2010, but Applicant did not make documented efforts to correct the problems \nuntil 2018 and did not completely resolve his tax problems until January 2022, after the hearing. \nThat delay continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. \nSeveral of the conditions that resulted in Applicant\u2019s financial problem were largely \nbeyond his control, to include his wife\u2019s underemployment, unemployment, and problems related \nto pregnancy. However, Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file his federal state returns and pay his taxes \nwas not beyond his control.  He resolved his delinquent state income taxes in March 2021 and his \nfederal income taxes in January 2022, and is due some mitigation for acting responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Similarly, Applicant receives limited mitigation for ultimately hiring a tax preparer \nto fix his returns.   \nApplicant\u2019s long history of federal and state tax problems weakens any claim to have \nmitigated by adhering to a good-faith effort to repay his tax creditors. Moreover, while Applicant \nasserted that he had entered into earlier IRS payment plans, the scant evidence of any plans or \npayments until the November 2020 plan weakens his assertion.  \nApplicant blamed \u201cbracket creep\u201d for his escalating tax liability between 2010 and 2016, \nbut \u201cthe irrefutable reason for the increase was the insufficient amount of taxes that Applicant had \nwithheld from his pay during the tax years at issue[.]\u201d  Decision at 11.  Although Applicant knew \nin 2011 that he could increase his withholdings, he took no action to fix his insufficient \nwithholdings. Additionally, for TY 2014, Applicant exercised poor judgment by not investigating \nthe tax consequences of his early withdrawal from his 401(k) account.  \nDiscussion \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant alleges that the Judge was biased, but we do not find that \nargument convincing. There is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, \nand a party seeking to overcome that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion. See, e. g., \nISCR Case No. 18-02722 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 30, 2020). In this regard, the issue is not whether \nApplicant personally believes the Judge was biased or prejudiced against Applicant. Rather, the \nissue is whether the record contains any indication the Judge acted in a manner that would lead a \nreasonable person to question the fairness and impartiality of the Judge. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n20-02787 at 3\u20134 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2022). \nApplicant cites several examples of bias.  First, he contends that the Judge was dismissive \nof Applicant\u2019s testimony concerning \u201cbracket creep,\u201d that is, his escalating tax liability in the early \n2010s. To the extent that we understand this argument, the record amply supports the Judge\u2019s \nconclusion that \u201cthe irrefutable reason for the increase was the insufficient amount of taxes that \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplicant had withheld[.]\u201d Decision at 11. The family income increased dramatically between \n2011 and 2016, with foreseeable and avoidable tax consequences. (Applicant\u2019s Exhibit G at 3\u2013 \n13.) \nSecond, Applicant asserts that the Judge\u2014without warning\u2014stated in his decision that \nApplicant\u2019s failure to timely file his federal and state returns was willful and therefore criminal in \nnature. \u201cThis assertion clearly had an impact in the evaluation of Applicant\u2019s clearance request \nand the Judge\u2019s evaluation of Applicant\u2019s proffered evidence and credibility.\u201d Appeal Brief at 3. \nHowever, the Judge clearly stated that \u201cthe criminal aspect of his conduct is not alleged in the \nSOR.\u201d  Decision at 9.  The Judge then proceeded to analyze Applicant\u2019s conduct solely under the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions of Guideline F. Moreover, contrary to Applicant\u2019s \nassertion, the Judge was well within his authority to consider whether Applicant\u2019s failure to file \ntax returns on time for TYs 2015\u20132018, as alleged on the SOR, was intentional, and the record \nevidence supports his conclusion. Applicant testified that he elected not to file because of the cost \nof the tax service and his concern that he could not afford the anticipated payment plan for the \nearlier tax delinquencies.  (Tr. at 80\u201384.) In sum, upon our review of the record and decision, we \nfind nothing that would lead a reasonable person to question the Judge\u2019s fairness and impartiality. \nApplicant asserts that the Judge\u2019s decision \u201cminimizes and dismisses Applicant\u2019s efforts \nto fully satisfy his tax debts between 2020 and 2021.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 10.  However, the fact that \nApplicant has corrected his state and federal tax problems, and the fact that he is now motivated \nto prevent such problems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of Applicant\u2019s \nsecurity worthiness in light of his longstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility. See \nISCR Case No. 12-05053 at 5 (App. Bd. Oct. 30, 2014). Moreover, the timing of debt payments \nis relevant in evaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation. Applicant filed his delinquent tax \nreturns in June 2020, more than a year after completing his SCA and being interviewed by a \ngovernment investigator. He began payments to the IRS in November 2020, shortly after issuance \nof the SOR. An applicant who begins to resolve security concerns only after having been placed \non notice that his or her clearance is in jeopardy may lack the judgment and willingness to follow \nrules and regulations when his or her personal interests are not threatened. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 17-01256 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, 2018).  \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s brief is fundamentally an argument that the Judge \nmisweighed the evidence. None of Applicant\u2019s arguments, however, are enough to rebut the \npresumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the Judge \nweighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Moreover, \nthe Judge complied with the requirements of the Directive in his whole-person analysis by \nconsidering all evidence of record in reaching his decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at \n2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). \nIn conclusion, Applicant has not identified any harmful error in the Judge\u2019s handling of his \ncase or in his decision. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory \nexplanation for his decision. The decision is sustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is \nthat a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national \nsecurity.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

He is married and has two sons with special needs. His wife works as an educator, and \ntheir combined annual gross income is nearly $200,000. \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant filed for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2005 that was \ndischarged in 2011; that he filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy again in 2017 with liabilities of \napproximately $300,000; that he was delinquent under the Chapter 13 payment plan by August \n2019 in the amount of $22,000; that he was indebted to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for \ndelinquent federal taxes for tax years 2011\u20132015 in the approximate amount of $25,500; and, that \nhe misused a company credit card in September 2017 to pay for repairs to his home.  \nIn responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted all allegations other than the federal tax \nindebtedness. Regarding the IRS debt, Applicant asserted that the delinquent taxes were under a \ngood-faith payment plan with the IRS prior to his 2017 bankruptcy filing, that they were included \nin his Chapter 13 payment plan, and that the trustee is currently making payments on the \nindebtedness. Applicant failed to provide documentation for his claim that he was making good-\nfaith payments to the IRS before filing his 2017 bankruptcy petition.  \nRegarding his indebtedness in general, Applicant testified at hearing that his financial \nproblems were caused by a 2011 house fire, his wife\u2019s medical issues, his two sons\u2019 special needs \ndiagnoses, the predatory practices of their mortgage company, and his wife\u2019s excessive spending.   \nRegarding his 2017 Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing, Applicant testified that he was delinquent on his \npayment plan in 2018 and again in 2019, that the plan was modified to increase his payments, and \nthat he was current on the payment plan as of the date of the hearing. Post-hearing, Applicant \nsubmitted documents that indicate he is making payments to the bankruptcy trustee, but not the \nfull payments required, and that he is again delinquent.  \nApplicant has not learned from his past mistakes or made responsible and appropriate \nfinancial adjustments to prevent new debt. Moreover, Applicant\u2019s intentional misuse of his \nemployer\u2019s credit card in 2017 is troubling and has serious security significance. Having been \ndelinquent on his Chapter 13 payment plan in 2018 and 2019, Applicant is again delinquent. There \nare not clear indications that his financial problems are being resolved. None of the mitigating \nconditions fully apply.  \nDiscussion \nApplicant has not challenged any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact. Rather, he \ncontends the Judge erred in failing to comply with the provisions in Executive Order 10865 and \nthe Directive by not considering all of the available evidence, by not giving the proper weight to \nmitigating evidence, and by failing to properly apply the whole-person concept. For example, \nApplicant argues that the Judge failed to properly weigh the number of hardships that were outside \nof his control and the positive actions he has taken to remediate his debts, to include filing for \nChapter 13 bankruptcy and making payments under the plan.

Although Applicant had payment \nplans for two of the SOR accounts, he did not present evidence that he had made payments. In \naddition, Applicant indicated that he was unaware of some of his debts, and he failed to substantiate \nthe basis for a claimed dispute of one of them. Although he hired a credit repair agency to assist \nhim with his debts, Applicant did not explain what services the agency was providing. When he \ncompleted his security clearance application (SCA) in 2018, Applicant did not disclose any of his \ndelinquent debts. Although the Judge found that Applicant may have been genuinely unaware of \nsome of the debts, he found that Applicant\u2019s failure to disclose the credit card account described \nabove was deliberate. \nThe Judge concluded that, though Applicant\u2019s financial problems were affected by a \ncircumstance beyond his control\u2014his unemployment\u2014Applicant had not presented evidence of \nreasonable action in regard to his debts. He noted a paucity of evidence concerning any benefits \nconferred by Applicant\u2019s credit repair agency, and he stated that there are no clear indications that \nApplicant\u2019s problems are being resolved or are under control. Regarding Guideline E, the Judge \nfound Applicant\u2019s explanations for his failure to disclose the credit card debt to be \u201cproblematic.\u201d \nDecision at 7. He noted that Applicant had an opportunity to correct the omission during his \ninterview but failed to do so until the interviewer confronted him with the debt. The Judge \nconcluded that Applicant had not mitigated the SOR concerns raised under Guidelines E and F. \nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions concerning his failure to \ndisclose his debt to the credit union. The SOR actually alleged two debts owed to this creditor, a \ncar loan and the credit card account addressed above, neither of which Applicant disclosed in his \nSCA. Applicant contends that, during the interview, the investigator confused the car loan with \nanother debt owed to a different creditor. \u201c[Applicant] was not confronted with his [credit union \ncar loan] account . . . [Applicant] had no intent to omit information from his SCA or his \ninterview[.]\u201d Appeal Brief at 6. We construe this argument to mean that the investigator \nmistakenly believed that the car loan was owed not to the credit union but to some other creditor.  \nAccordingly, he did not confront Applicant with the true creditor to whom the car loan was owed, \nwhich undermines the Judge\u2019s finding that Applicant did not correct this omission before being \nconfronted with the debt.  \nHowever, the evidence underlying the Judge\u2019s Guideline E analysis does not pertain to the \ncar loan. Rather, it pertains to the credit card debt. The summary of Appellant\u2019s clearance \ninterview demonstrates that, after Applicant denied having any debts more than 180 days old, the \ninvestigator then confronted him with the $16,000 credit card debt owed to the credit union, and \nApplicant admitted its legitimacy. There is nothing in the record to suggest that Applicant had no \nactual knowledge of the credit card debt at the time he completed his SCA or at the time of his \nclearance interview. The Judge\u2019s findings on this matter are generally consistent with the \ninterview summary. 1 See Government Exhibit 2, Interview Summary, at 8 and 12-13. The Judge\u2019s \n1 Assuming without deciding that the interviewer confused the car loan with a debt owed to some other creditor, it did \nnot exert any influence on the Judge\u2019s decision. He found in Applicant\u2019s favor regarding this debt both under \nGuideline F and Guideline E. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nfindings are based \u201cupon such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to \nsupport a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d Directive \u204b \nE3.1.32.1. \nThe balance of Applicant\u2019s brief is a challenge to the Judge\u2019s application of the mitigating \nconditions and the whole-person factors.

In responding to the SOR, Applicant denied one \nallegation and admitted the other four, asserting that he had paid two of the admitted accounts. He did \nnot include any documentary evidence to support his claims of resolution or dispute. On March \n25, 2022, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material (FORM) to Applicant for his \nreview and response. The Judge noted that Applicant did not submit a response to the FORM and \nconcluded that \u201c[a]bsent documentary evidence of any debt-resolution efforts or other evidence \ndemonstrating his financial responsibility, none of the mitigating conditions apply.\u201d Decision at \n7. \nOn appeal, Applicant asserts that he submitted five documents for the Judge\u2019s consideration, to \ninclude receipts and pay stubs showing payments. In support of that issue, Applicant\u2019s brief contains \nan email chain in which he discussed his case with a DOHA administrative staff member and \nforwarded two attachments for consideration by the Judge. We also note this email chain reflects \nthat Applicant stated, \u201cIf possible i\u2019d (sic) like to speak with you [the administrative staff member] \nprior to the hearing[,]\u201d which raises the issue whether Applicant requested a hearing or intended \nto request a hearing. This latter issue should have been appropriately addressed and resolved \nbefore the FORM was sent to the Judge for a decision on the written record. \nThe Appeal Board is generally prohibited from considering new evidence. Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.29. However, we may consider new evidence insofar as it bears upon questions of due \nprocess or jurisdiction. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01472 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 6, 2018). The \nemail chain attached to Applicant\u2019s brief confirms the communications on May 16, 2022, which \nwas a timely response to the FORM. As such, Applicant has made a credible proffer that \ndocuments were submitted to DOHA that were, for unknown reasons, not forwarded to \nDepartment Counsel for inclusion in the FORM submitted to the Judge. In his reply brief, Chief \nDepartment Counsel indicates the Government has no objection to remanding this case for the \nJudge to consider the documents that were submitted. \nBased on the above, we conclude the best course of action is to remand the case to the Judge \nto determine whether Applicant requested a hearing or intended to request a hearing, and to reopen \nthe record to provide Applicant an opportunity to re-submit the documents that should have been \npresented to the Judge. As provided in Directive \u00b6 E3.1.35, the Judge shall, upon remand, issue a \nnew decision in the case. The Board retains no continuing jurisdiction over a remanded decision. \nHowever, a decision issued after remand may be appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28. to \nE3.1.35.

He argues that there must be other factors\u2015such as \naddiction, gambling or mental health problems\u2015associated with the debts for them to be \ndisqualifying. This is an inaccurate interpretation of the Directive. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19\u00ad\n03940 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jan. 10, 2022) for a lengthier discussion of this issue. It is well established \nthat financial problems, standing alone, may be a sufficient basis to raise security concerns and to \ndisqualify an applicant from being granted a security clearance. The three delinquent debts alleged \nin the SOR were a sufficient basis for the Judge to deny Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility. \nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant had \u201cno plans to make \npayments\u201d on two of the alleged debts, i.e., the mortgage account and a charged-off credit card \naccount. Appeal Brief at 5, quoting from Decision at 3. In his findings, the Judge noted that \nforeclosure proceeding had started on the mortgage account and that Applicant has not made any \nrecent payments on the credit card account. Based on our review, the challenged conclusions were \nreasonable inferences drawn from the evidence. Applicant has not cited any evidence that would \nestablish the Judge erred in making those conclusions.   \nApplicant contends the Judge improperly analyzed the evidence. For example, he argues \nthat the Judge erred by overemphasizing the unfavorable evidence and by failing to apply correctly \nthe mitigating conditions. In his arguments, Applicant highlights his military service, attributes \nhis financial problems to a 2016 divorce, and notes he has never been involved in a security \nincident. He further claims that the Government does not oppose him being granted a security \nclearance. In essence, Applicant\u2019s brief argues for an alternative interpretation of the record \nevidence, which is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions are \nerroneous. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001). Applicant has not \nrebutted the presumption that the Judge considered all the evidence in the record, nor has he shown \nthe Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to the \nevidence.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020).    \nApplicant failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful errors. The Judge examined \nthe relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The decision is \nsustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \n\u2018clearly consistent with national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

He did not remember how he got from the bar back to his hotel \nroom, but believed that one of his active duty companions drove him to his hotel. He missed the \nclass he was supposed to attend the next day. \nIn 2011, Applicant consumed about six ounces of methanol that he kept in his freezer and \nmistook for vodka. He called poison control and was taken by ambulance to the hospital, where \nhe remained overnight. \nIn 2015, Applicant slipped off of the couch after consuming alcohol, cut his toe on a knife \nthat was on the floor, and received care at an urgent care clinic.

He described himself as having \u201cextreme competency in being a functioning \ndrunk,\u201d and his off-duty alcohol consumption did not adversely affect his performance at work. \nDecision at 3, quoting from Tr. at 30.

In late 2018, \nhe began 105-minute weekly group therapy sessions. At this point, he limited his alcohol \nconsumption to three to four beers when he drank. In March 2020, he stopped meeting with a \ntherapist because of COVID-19 pandemic security protocols. His therapist did not provide a \nwritten diagnosis or prognosis. Applicant was never explicitly told that he should abstain from \nalcohol consumption. However, he acknowledged that\u2014during group sessions\u2014 the message was \nthat it was best to completely abstain from alcohol consumption. In addition to his group and \nindividual therapy sessions, Applicant attended about 15 Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings.  \nApplicant\u2019s current level of alcohol consumption is \u201calmost zero.\u201d Decision at 4. For \nabout eight months in 2021, he did not drink any alcohol. While visiting family in the month prior \nto his hearing, Applicant drank nine beers during a three-day weekend, which was the most alcohol \nhe had consumed in the previous year. \u201cHe acknowledged that after consuming one drink, \ninhibitions are somewhat relaxed and the next drink is more of a possibility.\u201d Decision at 4, citing \nTr. at 75\u201376. Nevertheless, he is confident that he is able to control the amount of alcohol he \nconsumes. He lives in a drug-free and alcohol-free community. \nOn March 5, 2020, a psychologist, Dr. B, evaluated Applicant and diagnosed alcohol use \ndisorder (moderate). In summary, she wrote: \nGiven [Applicant\u2019s] drinking habits, his family history of substance abuse and \nmental health conditions, as well as [Personality Assessment Inventory (PAI)] \nresults pointing to significant alcohol-related problems and variable mood, there is \nreason for concern. These factors, coupled with his history of alcohol-related \nincidents and lack of long term plans to abstain from alcohol, raise questions about \nhis judgment. \n* * * \nCONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the risk of future alcohol-related incidents seems \nmoderate, and [Applicant\u2019s] prognosis appears guarded. Although [Applicant] \nreported that he had been consistent with individual and group therapy, and he has \ngained insight into himself and his drinking, a medical opinion could not be \nobtained and during the investigatory process, he consistently conveyed a lack of \nconfidence in his ability to avoid relapse in the face of future stressors.

(Tr. 77) He rationalized that the reason for ending his alcohol consumption \nshould be because of his personal goals and not because of security concerns related to his alcohol \nconsumption. (Tr. 77)\u201d Decision at 5. \nApplicant never drives after consuming alcohol. Over the last three years, he has consumed \nsufficient alcohol to be intoxicated on three or four occasions. In that time frame, the most alcohol \nhe consumed was one mixed drink and five beers in November 2020, when his father passed away. \nApplicant provided letters from four character references, who describe him as a model \nemployee\u2014mature, professional, empathetic, punctual, helpful, trustworthy, responsible, and \nreliable. Two statements also described an improvement in Applicant\u2019s health and general \nwellbeing in the last few years. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis: The Judge\u2019s analysis is summarized and quoted below. \nThe record evidence establishes Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6 22(a), alcohol-related \nincidents away from work; AG \u00b6 22(c), habitual or binge consumption of alcohol; and AG \u00b6 22(d), \ndiagnosis of alcohol use disorder. Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 22(a), 22(c), and 22(d). Although \nnone of the four mitigating conditions1 fully apply, Applicant provided important mitigating \ninformation. He voluntarily and credibly disclosed his history of alcohol consumption during his \nOPM interview, during his March 2020 evaluation, and at his hearing. He attended individual and \ngroup counseling and reduced the amount and frequency of his alcohol consumption. He has no \nalcohol-related arrests, and there is no evidence of security violations or abuse of illegal drugs. \nUnder DSM-5, Applicant has met the criteria for sustained remission, as he has not had \nany employment, legal, familial, or relationship difficulties for more than 12 months. He is in \ncontrol of his alcohol consumption, and it has a limited role in his life. He is sincere, credible, and \ncandid. Nevertheless, Applicant\u2019s satisfaction of the DSM-5 criteria for sustained remission does \nnot necessarily establish mitigation for security clearance requirements. \nThe evidence against mitigation is more persuasive at this time. In 2010, \nApplicant had an instance of alcohol-related memory loss or an alcohol blackout. \n1 AG \u00b6\u00b6 23(a), so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, or it happened under such unusual \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; 23(b), the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive alcohol use, provides evidence of \nactions taken to overcome this problem, and has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption \nor abstinence in accordance with treatment recommendations; 23(c), the individual is participating in counseling or a \ntreatment program, has no previous history of treatment and relapse, and is making satisfactory progress in a treatment \nprogram; and 23(d), the individual has successfully completed a treatment program along with any required aftercare, \nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or abstinence in accordance with \ntreatment recommendations. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe memory loss was due to binge-alcohol consumption. In an alcohol blackout, a \nperson: \nis still fully conscious. They\u2019re moving around, acting, engaging, talking, \ndancing, driving, engaging in all kinds of behavior, but because of \nalcohol\u2019s inhibition of the transfer of information from short-term memory \nto long-term memory, they simply will be unable to remember those \ndecisions or actions they made while in the blackout. \nIn United States v. Pease, 74 M.J. 763, 769 (N-M. Ct. Crim. App. 2015), an \nexpert on the effects of alcohol intoxication, Dr. Kim Fromme, Ph.D., described the \nlevels of alcohol intoxication and the impact on human behavior, cognitive abilities, \nand memory. See also United States v. Collins, No. 201000020, 2011 CCA LEXIS \n22 at *4-*8. (N-M. Ct. Crim. App. 2011) (unpub.) (testimony of prosecution \ntoxicology expert, Jon Jemiomek). \nA person who is in a blacked-out state may still \u201cengage in voluntary \nbehavior and thought processes. \u2018They might make decisions, for example, to drive \nhome from a bar, or [engage in other] . . . activities which require complex cognitive \nabilities, but the individual might not remember the next day and might, in fact, \nmight regret it.\u2019\u201d Pease, 74 M.J. at 769. See also United States v. Clark, NMCCA \n201400232 at *13-*17, *22-*23. (NMCCCA Jul. 14, 2015) (statements of Dr. \nStafford Henry, M.D. and Dr. Thomas Grieger, M.D.). A person who consumes \nalcohol to a blacked-out state may not remember how much alcohol they consumed, \nor they may violate national security and have no recollection of their conduct. \n. \n. \n. \nApplicant drank nine beers over a three-day period 30 days before his \nhearing. He has consumed sufficient alcohol over the last three years to be \nintoxicated on three or four occasions. A commitment to sobriety is not required \nunder the Adjudicative Guidelines; however, his declination from committing to \nsobriety while holding a security clearance is inconsistent with the recommendation \nof the evaluating psychologist, Dr. B. He attended numerous therapeutic sessions, \nincluding about 15 AA meetings, and complete sobriety as a goal is often suggested \nat those sessions. Nevertheless, Applicant has elected to continue alcohol \nconsumption. Moreover, if Applicant receives a security clearance and resumes \nstressful employment, there is also an increased risk he will utilize alcohol to \naddress his anxiety. Applicant has not fully accepted the risk entailed in his strategy \nof continued, albeit limited, alcohol consumption. \nApplicant\u2019s history of alcohol consumption and plans for continued alcohol \nconsumption cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and judgment. \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply, and Guideline G security concerns \nare not mitigated at this time.

In March 2020, a psychologist \ndiagnosed him with alcohol use disorder (moderate) and commented that his \u201clack \nof long term plans to abstain from alcohol, raise questions about his judgment.\u201d \nDespite completion of counseling, attendance at AA meetings, and therapy, he \ncontinues to consume alcohol. [Decision at 11.] \nDiscussion \nApplicant argues that the Judge was biased. In particular, he contends that the Judge \napplied his personal criteria\u2014rather than AG \u00b6 22\u2019s criteria\u2014in denying a clearance based on \nApplicant\u2019s continued consumption of alcohol. Applicant highlights that continued alcohol \nconsumption is a disqualifying condition under AG \u00b6 22(f) when it is done against treatment \nrecommendation. \nHowever, Applicant points out, there is no evidence of any treatment \nrecommendation that he abstain. Thus, he argues, the Judge demonstrated a lack of impartiality \nin imposing an abstinence requirement upon him. \nThis argument by Applicant raises two distinct issues: whether the Judge erred in his \napplication of the disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 22 and whether he demonstrated a lack of \nimpartiality in this regard or otherwise. We turn first to Applicant\u2019s argument that the Judge \nimproperly imposed a requirement of abstinence. \nAs evidence in support of his argument that the Judge would be satisfied only with total \nabstinence, Applicant cited to a statement that the Judge made during the hearing: \u201c[I]f you came \ninto your hearing today and said, \u2018I have not consumed alcohol since I received Dr. B\u2019s report. \nComplete abstinence,\u2019 that would improve your chance of getting a clearance.\u201d Appeal Brief at 2, \nciting Tr. at 76.  \nThe Judge\u2019s reference to Dr. B\u2019s report highlights a thread that runs through his decision\u2014 \nequating Dr. B\u2019s comment with a treatment recommendation. In the course of adjudicating \nApplicant\u2019s clearance, DoD Consolidated Adjudications Facility (DoD CAF) requested that he \nsubmit to a psychological evaluation. GE 4 at 3. Applicant agreed, and DoD CAF sent him to Dr. \nB, a clinical psychologist. Dr. B conducted a clinical interview, administered the Personality \nAssessment Inventory, and reviewed the investigative file. Her report contained the diagnosis of \nAlcohol Use Disorder (moderate) that formed the basis for the sole SOR allegation. In that report, \nshe referenced Applicant\u2019s \u201clack of long term plans to abstain from alcohol\u201d as a factor that raised \nquestions about his judgment. GE 3 at 6. Her report was prepared for\u2014and submitted to\u2014DoD \nCAF, not Applicant. Apparently, it was later sent to Applicant as part of the Government\u2019s \nrequired disclosure of evidence prior to hearing. \nDr. B\u2019s report is not a treatment recommendation within the meaning of AG \u00b6 22(f), alcohol \nconsumption, which is not in accordance with treatment recommendations, after a diagnosis of \nalcohol use disorder.

Nevertheless, in his decision, the Judge effectively converted \nDr. B\u2019s comment into a treatment recommendation and relied upon it in imposing what amounts \nto a requirement of total abstinence. Consequently, although he concluded that Applicant met the \ncriteria for sustained remission of his alcohol use disorder, that he is in control of his alcohol \nconsumption, and that alcohol has a limited role in his life, the Judge nevertheless concluded that \nApplicant has not mitigated the security concerns. \u201cA commitment to sobriety is not required \nunder the Adjudicative Guidelines; however, [Applicant\u2019s] declination from committing to \nsobriety while holding a security clearance is inconsistent with the recommendation of the \nevaluating psychologist, Dr. B.\u201d Decision at 10. \nIn light of his determination that Applicant was in sustained remission, the Judge failed to \nexplain adequately why he placed such emphasis on total abstinence which\u2014given the facts of \nthis case\u2014 is not required. Said differently, in effectively adopting a requirement for abstinence, \nthe Judge failed to explain why Dr. B\u2019s comment outweighed Applicant\u2019s significant mitigating \nevidence: the passage of time since the incidents that the Judge cites; the passage of two more \nyears since Dr. B\u2019s evaluation; the fact that Applicant has \u201climited to almost zero alcohol use\u201d;2 \nthe fact that he has chosen to live in an alcohol-free community; and the fact that he is in sustained \nremission from the diagnosis of alcohol disorder (moderate), which is the sole SOR allegation. \nWe turn next to Applicant\u2019s allegation of bias. Bias involves partiality for or against a \nparty, predisposition to decide a case or issue with regard to the merits, or other indicia of a lack \nof impartiality. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-03974 at 6 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2006). There is a \nrebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking to overcome \nthat presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion. See, e. g., ISCR Case No. 18-02722 at 5 (App. \nBd. Jan. 30, 2020). The standard is not whether a party personally believes a Judge was biased or \nprejudiced against that party, but rather whether the record of the proceedings below contains any \nindication that the Judge acted in a manner that would lead a reasonable, disinterested person to \nquestion the fairness and impartiality of the Judge. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-03974 at 6. \nUnlike Applicant, we are not persuaded that the Judge\u2019s emphasis on abstinence arose from \nbias. A reasonable person might well conclude that the Judge simply conflated the evaluating \npsychologist\u2019s remarks with a treatment recommendation. However, our review of the record and \ndecision reveals a separate issue of concern. We conclude that the Judge demonstrated a lack of \nimpartiality in this case in that he sought, considered, and relied upon evidence not introduced by \nthe parties, that he did so post-hearing, and that he did so with no notice to the parties. Specifically, \nthe Judge sought evidence regarding the effects of alcohol intoxication and its impact on cognitive \nabilities and memory. He found that evidence in three decisions from the Navy-Marine Corps \nCourt of Criminal Appeals, which contained expert testimony on intoxication that was offered at \nthe preceding courts-martial. In particular, the Judge relied upon the experts\u2019 testimony regarding \nblackouts in reaching his own conclusion that \u201c[a] person who consumes alcohol to a blacked-out \nstate may not remember how much alcohol they consumed, or they may violate national security \nand have no recollection of their conduct.\u201d Decision at 9. In other words, the Judge imported \nexpert testimony from three Navy-Marine Corps courts-martial into this case to reach an adverse \nconclusion about Applicant\u2019s blackout incident of twelve years ago. \n2 Decision at 5. \n7 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA Judge\u2019s decision must be based on record evidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-05110 \nat 4-6 (App. Bd. Mar. 22, 2004). See also, ISCR Case No. 14-06050 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 28, 2017). \n(\u201c[I]n a DOHA proceeding, the Judge bases his or her decision strictly on the pleadings and on the \nevidence submitted by the parties.\u201d) The Judge may not serve as an advocate for either side. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 12-10335 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 29, 2017). The Judge should not become an \ninvestigator for either side by seeking out or introducing new evidence into the case, as such a \ncourse of action is inconsistent with his duty of impartiality. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 16-03709 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 2, 2018). It is particularly problematic when the Judge does so after conclusion \nof the hearing and with no notice to the parties. In addition to compromising his impartiality, the \nnew evidence introduces an unfair element of surprise into the decision and raises issues of due \nprocess, as nothing at the hearing would have led Applicant to believe that the Judge would \nconsider anything other than the documents and testimony presented by the parties and admitted \ninto the record. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-06050 at 3. Based on our review of the record and \ndecision, we conclude a reasonable person might question the Judge\u2019s impartiality based on his \nsua sponte post-hearing consideration of expert testimony from unrelated courts-martial without \nproviding notice to the parties. In effect, the Judge\u2019s decision was impermissibly based, at least in \npart, on non-record evidence. \nGiven these errors, we conclude that the best resolution is to remand this case to a different \njudge for a new hearing. Applicant raises other issues on appeal that are not ripe for consideration. \nThe Board retains no jurisdiction over a remanded decision. However, the Judge\u2019s decision issued \nafter remand may be appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nOrder \nThe decision is REMANDED. \nSigned: James F.

She \ndoes, however, aver that her status as the Facility Security Officer (FSO) for her employer \nadversely affected her in two ways: first, she did not have anyone to whom she could report her \nfinancial issues; and, second, she was not served with notice of the revocation of her clearance. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAdditionally, she states that she has made efforts to re-establish a solid credit history and requests \nfurther consideration of the credit report she submitted to the Administrative Judge. \nTurning first to her status as FSO, the SOR did not allege a failure-to-report, and a review \nof the record confirms that no evidence or argument referenced any such failure on her part. Nor \ndoes the Judge\u2019s decision. Moreover, although the record does not establish how Applicant \nreceived her notice of denial of her security clearance, the record does confirm that she filed a \nNotice of Appeal, was duly provided with instructions on how to appeal, and subsequently filed \nher appeal, after one extension was granted. A review of the entire record discloses no basis to \nconclude that Applicant was denied the rights due her under the Directive or that she had not been \nadequately advised of those rights. See, e.g., ISCR Case No 15-04472 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 9, 2017). \nTurning next to Applicant\u2019s request for further consideration of a previously-submitted \ncredit report, the Appeal Board does not review cases de novo.  Our authority to review is limited \nto cases in which the appealing party has raised a claim of harmful error. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n18-01962 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 29, 2019).

On \nOctober 27, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2015security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct), Guideline E \n(Personal Conduct), and Guideline G (Alcohol Consumption) of Department of Defense Directive \n5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a decision on the written \nrecord. On February 9, 2022, after considering the record, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA) Administrative Wilford H. Ross granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \nDepartment Counsel appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nDepartment Counsel raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in an \nevidentiary ruling, and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary \nto law.

He has worked for a Defense contractor since 2018. \nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleged that Applicant was arrested for and charged with \nnumerous criminal offenses, some of which resulted in convictions. In 1994, he was charged with \nFelony Grand Theft Vehicles and convicted of Receiving Known Stolen Property. The court \nsentenced him to a day in jail and 36 months of probation.

Applicant \nstated to his clearance interviewer that he was not aware that he had been charged with a felony.  \nOne year later, Applicant was charged with Rape by Force or Fear, Felony Rape Drugged Victim, \nEscape or Attempt to Escape, and two counts of Sexual Intercourse with a Minor. Following \nconviction for the latter two types of offenses, Applicant was sentenced to 365 days in jail and 36 \nmonths of probation. Applicant advised the clearance interviewer that he had not disclosed this \noffense on his security clearance application (SCA) because he \u201cwas initially charged with felony \nrape but the later outcome was a misdemeanor[.]\u201d Decision at 3. \nIn March 1999, Applicant was charged with Driving When Privilege Suspended. \nApplicant admitted this allegation in his Answer to the SOR. The Judge found in Applicant\u2019s \nfavor \u201cdue to lack of evidence.\u201d Decision at 3. In September of that same year, Applicant was \ncharged with Falsely Representing Self to a Peace Officer, Driving When Privilege Suspended, \nand Failure to Provide Evidence of Financial Responsibility. Applicant admitted this allegation in \nhis Answer to the SOR. Again, the Judge found this allegation in Applicant\u2019s favor \u201cdue to lack \nof evidence.\u201d Decision at 4. He was arrested in February 2003 on one count of Force/Assault \nwith a Deadly Weapon Not a Firearm.  The Judge found that no further information was available \nregarding this allegation. Applicant was arrested in October 2008 for Inflict Corporal Injury on \nSpouse/Cohabitant. Applicant did not know he had been charged with an offense.  In March 2009 \nApplicant was charged and convicted with Manufacture or Possession of a Dangerous Weapon \nand sentenced to sixteen months in prison, serving eight. He stated in his security clearance \napplication (SCA) that the weapon was a souvenir baseball bat. The Judge found a similar alleged \noffense in June of that year was a duplicate of the previous allegation. \nIn December 2012, Applicant was charged with DUI and was sentenced to 36 months of \nprobation following conviction. In April of the next year he was arrested and charged with DUI, \nDriving While License Suspended, and Driving Without an Interlock Device. He was sentenced \nto thirty days in jail and 36 months of probation. In December 2014 Applicant was charged with \nDriving While License Suspended or Revoked for DUI, Speeding, and Operating Vehicle Without \nInterlock Device. In March 2015, Applicant was again arrested and charged with DUI, Driving \nWhile License Suspended, etc. He was sentenced to 90 days work release, a suspended jail \n2 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nsentence, and probation.1 Finally, in April 2016, he was arrested and charged with Driving \nSuspended License. \nApplicant competed his SCA in January 2019. The SCA inquired if Applicant had been \ninvolved in criminal conduct within the previous seven years. He disclosed his arrests in December \n2012, April 2013, and March 2015 but did not disclose the 2016 charge. The SCA also inquired \nif Applicant had (1) \u201cEVER been convicted in any court of the United States of a crime, sentenced \nto imprisonment for a term exceeding a year, and incarcerated as a result of that sentence for not \nless than a year\u201d and (2) if he had \u201cEVER been charged with any felony offenses.\u201d Applicant \ndisclosed the March 2009 dangerous weapon charge but did not disclose the 1994 charge of grand \ntheft or the 1997 charge of rape. The Judge found that Applicant had not listed the rape charge \nbecause it ultimately resulted in a misdemeanor conviction.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis \nThe Judge stated that Applicant\u2019s arrests after 2009 were limited to alcohol offenses. Since \n2015 he has returned to school, changed careers, and \u201cmoved on with his life.\u201d Decision at 9. He \nstated that he had entered favorable findings for several allegations due to lack of evidence. \nRegarding the omissions from the SCA, the Judge stated that Applicant should have disclosed the \n1996 charge of receiving stolen property and the 1997 rape. He did not discuss Applicant\u2019s failure \nto disclose the 1994 grand theft charge and stated that Applicant did not believe that he had to \nreport the 1996 and 1997 felonies. He concluded that Applicant\u2019s omissions met the criteria for \nDirective, Encl. 2, App. A \u204b 16, \u201cdeliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire[.]\u201d He went on to state that Applicant\u2019s omissions \nwere not done with the \u201cintent to deceive[.]\u201d Decision at 11. Under Guideline G, the Judge found \nthat Applicant had abstained from alcohol since 2015 and has changed his life.  \nDiscussion \nThere is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of a security clearance. See \nDorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).  The \napplicant is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate admitted \nor proven facts. The applicant has the burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable decision. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.15. The standard applicable in security clearance decisions \u201cis that a clearance \nmay be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel \nbeing considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the \ndecision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a \nsatisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts \nfound and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of \njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \n1 \u201cSentencing entailed: 90-days jail time, fines of about $2500, and either a three or five year DUI probation.

See ISCR Case No. 14-02563 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2015). \nEvidentiary Ruling \nDepartment Counsel argues that the Judge erred in his ruling regarding Item 5, a summary \nof Applicant\u2019s clearance interview. We evaluate a Judge\u2019s rulings regarding the admission of \nevidence to see whether the rulings were arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 15-05047 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 8, 2017). \nThe Judge addressed Item 5 in this manner: \nItem 5 is inadmissible. It will not be considered or cited as evidence against \nApplicant\u2019s interests in this case. It is the summary of an unsworn interview of \nApplicant conducted by an interviewer from the Office of Personnel Management \non March 22, 2019. Applicant did not adopt it as his own statement, or otherwise \ncertify it to be accurate. Under Directive \u204b E3.1.20, this Report of Investigation \n(ROI) summary is inadmissible against Applicant\u2019s interests in the absence of an \nauthenticating witness . . . In light of Applicant\u2019s admissions, Item 5 is also \ncumulative. I reviewed the ROI for any potentially mitigating information that \nApplicant might have thought would be considered. \nAny such mitigating \ninformation will be set forth in this decision.  Decision at 2 (emphasis added). \nWe construe this to mean that, despite characterizing the document as inadmissible, the Judge \nnevertheless admitted it for the limited purpose of considering whatever mitigating information it \nmight contain. \nWe agree with Department Counsel that the Judge erred in his treatment of this document.  \nWe note that the File of Relevant Material (FORM), in a paragraph printed in boldface type, \nadvised Applicant that he could object to Item 5 as being unauthenticated. However, \u201c[i]f no \nobjections are raised in your response to this FORM, or if you do not respond to this FORM, the \nAdministrative Judge may determine that you have waived any objections to the admissibility of \nthe summary and may consider the summary as evidence in your case.\u201d Applicant did not make a \nresponse to the FORM, and the Judge erred by not addressing whether Applicant had waived his \nobjection to Item 5.2 \nMore to the point, however, the Judge erred by considering Item 5 solely to the extent that \nit could be viewed as favorable to Applicant but not otherwise. In a recent decision we addressed \na similar such ruling. In concluding that the Judge in that case erred by admitting an interview \n2 See United States v. Robinson, 275 F.3d 371, 383 (4th Cir. 2001) (\u201cA party may manifest adoption of a statement in \na number of ways, including [through] words, conduct, or silence.\u201d). As an example of adoption by silence, see ISCR \nCase No. 15-05252 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 13, 2016) (remanding a decision in which an applicant on appeal challenged \nthe Judge\u2019s exclusion of her unauthenticated background interview from evidence.

Once the background interview was admitted into the record, it should have \nbeen considered for all pertinent purposes. It was arbitrary and capricious to \nexclude derogatory information in the background interview from being considered \nfor disqualifying purposes. The Judge\u2019s challenged evidentiary ruling is a clear \nerror in judgment and contrary to law. [ISCR Case No. 19-01174 at 3-4 (App. Bd. \nFeb. 6, 2020)] \nIn the case before us, the Judge committed a similar error. Directive \u204b E3.1.20 provides that an \nunauthenticated ROI is inadmissible. \nIt does not provide that an unauthenticated ROI is \ninadmissible only against an applicant\u2019s interests, and even less does it provide that a Judge can \nadmit only portions of an unauthenticated ROI to fulfill whatever uncommunicated expectation \nthe Judge believes that the applicant may have held regarding consideration of that document\u2019s \ncontents. The Judge neither cites authority nor articulates a satisfactory legal basis for considering \nonly the portions of the interview favorable to Applicant.3 Having effectively chosen to admit it, \nthe Judge was required to consider the document as a whole. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-02903 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017) (A Judge cannot ignore, disregard, or fail to discuss significant record \nevidence that a reasonable person could expect to be taken into account in reaching a fair and \nreasoned decision). By only considering the favorable aspects of Item 5, the Judge\u2019s analysis of \nthe evidence was unfairly skewed. As it stands, the Judge\u2019s selective consideration of Item 5 was \narbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. \nGuideline J Allegations \nIn claiming the Judge failed to consider all relevant evidence, Department Counsel \ncontends the Judge erred in concluding there was insufficient evidence to establish the incidents \nalleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.e., 1.f, 1.j, 1.l, 1.m, and 1.n because Applicant admitted those allegations.  \nThese allegations asserted Applicant was arrested and charged with various offenses. Department \nCounsel argues \u201cas a matter of law, the Administrative Judge cannot find these allegations to be \nunproven.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 21.  These arguments are not persuasive. \nWe find no error in the Judge\u2019s favorable findings regarding SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.n. \nFirst, we note the paucity of supporting evidence in the record. The record evidence consists of \nApplicant\u2019s SOR Response, his 2019 SCA, his background interview (which the Judge effectively \nadmitted into evidence, see discussion above), and a FBI Identification Record (i.e., criminal \nrecord).  Second, there is no record evidence, except for Applicant\u2019s admissions, supporting SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.e, 1.f, and 1.n. Of note, those alleged arrests or charges are not listed in the FBI criminal \nrecord, and Applicant was not questioned about them during his background interview.

See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n99-0119 at 2 (App. Bd. Sep. 13, 1999) (\u201cThe fact that an applicant has been arrested or otherwise \ncharged with a criminal offense, standing alone, does not constitute proof that the applicant \nengaged in criminal conduct. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0424 at 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 16, 1999). \nAccordingly, the fact that an applicant has been arrested on several occasions does not prove that \nhe engaged in criminal conduct with which he has been charged.\u201d). Under the specific facts of \nthis case, the Judge\u2019s favorable findings on each of these allegations \u201cdue to lack of evidence\u201d was \nnot arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  Decision at 3-4. \nNext, Department Counsel contends the Judge erred in concluding SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.m \nwere duplicates of 1.i and 1.l, respectively. Department Counsel notes the entries in the FBI \ncriminal report for the purported duplicate allegations reflect different law enforcement agencies \nas well as distinct arrest and fingerprint dates. These arguments fail to consider relevant and \nmaterial evidence. The FBI entries in question reflect that Applicant was \u201carrested or received,\u201d \nlist identical offenses, and indicate the length of time between the entries in both instances is about \nthree months. Government Exhibit 6 at 3-5. The entries supporting SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i and 1.j both reflect \nthat Applicant was sentenced to 16 months in prison, and the second entry reflects the law \nenforcement agency is the \u201cDept of Corr[,].\u201d i.e., the Department of Corrections. For the other \npurported duplicate allegations, one entry reflects Applicant was sentenced to 30 days in jail, while \nthe second indicates the law enforcement agency is the \u201cSheriff\u2019s Office.\u201d Id. It was not \nunreasonable for the Judge to conclude that each set of entries related to the same offense, and one \nentry pertains to Applicant\u2019s incarceration for that offense. The Judge committed no error in \nconcluding the allegations in question were duplicates. \nFalsification Allegation \nThe falsification allegation is troubling. As written, it alleged that Applicant falsified his \nSCA by failing to disclose 12 instances in which he was either arrested for, charged with, or \nconvicted of criminal offenses. This allegation asserted Applicant failed to disclose three arrests \nor charges (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, 1.k, and 1.o) that he actually did disclose in his SCA.  It also alleged five \nother failures-to-disclose (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.e, 1.f, 1.g, and 1.h) that either do not fall within the scope \nof the SCA questions at issue or for which there is no supporting evidence. For example, the SOR \nalleges that Applicant failed to disclose an arrest in 1999 for traffic offenses. No question in the \nSCA requires an applicant to disclose 22-year-old traffic offenses. Additionally, Applicant denied \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.g and 1.h, and there is no evidence in the record concerning those allegations.  \nIn the File of Relevant Material (FORM), Department Counsel noted that Guideline E \nallegations contain \u201ca number of minor typos\u201d pointing out Applicant disclosed his interactions \nwith law enforcement authorities that were alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i, 1.k, and 1.o. We recognize that \ntypographical errors may occur in drafting SOR allegations, but the identified errors in this SOR \nallegation go well beyond \u201cminor typos.\u201d Department Counsel\u2019s disclosure is, at best, an \ninaccurate and glaring understatement. Without much scrutiny of the record, it is apparent that \naspects of the falsification allegation are either baseless or not supported by any evidence. \nSurprisingly, Department Counsel did not withdraw in the FORM those problematic aspects of the \nfalsification allegation. Security clearance adjudications must be conducted in a fair manner. See \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 4.1 and E3.1.10.

These included two arrests/charges \nfor felony offenses that occurred more than 20 years ago and an arrest/charges for DUI and Driving \nSuspended License in 2016. In his SCA, Applicant disclosed three DUI convictions and a felony \nconviction for possession of a deadly weapon. These disclosures put the Government on notice of \nhis criminal conduct. We also note that Applicant is a machinist with a GED, that he was applying \nfor a security clearance for the first time (GE 1 at 41), and that, in responding to the SOR, he \nadmitted to at least two allegations (\u00b6\u00b6 1.j and 1.m, duplicate allegations (the incarcerations)) that \nhe could have legitimately denied. In his background interview, Applicant indicated that he did \nnot report the rape charge because he was convicted of misdemeanors. The Judge concluded \nApplicant did not have the requisite intent to deceive in failing to make the required disclosures.  \nThe arbitrary and capricious review standard is highly deferential. See, e.g., ATT Corp. v. FCC, \n220 F.3d. 607, 616 (D.C. Cir. 2000). An Appeal Board member need not agree with a Judge\u2019s \nconclusion in order to find it sustainable.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11-13965 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. \n6, 2013). \nGuideline G Allegations \nDepartment Counsel contends that the Judge erred in his analysis under this guideline. \nBetween 2012 and 2016, Applicant was convicted of alcohol-related offenses on three occasions \nand was also arrested for or charged with offenses of that nature on another occasion.5 The Judge \nconcluded that such conduct was unlikely to recur because Applicant indicated he has abstained \nfrom alcohol use for over five years. We do not find that conclusion to be arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law.  \nGuideline J Analysis \nWe find persuasive Department Counsel\u2019s arguments that the Judge\u2019s analysis of the \nGuideline J allegations is flawed. Although the SOR overstates Applicant\u2019s criminality in several \nregards, the record establishes that he engaged in criminal conduct for a period of over 20 years. \nHe has been convicted of offenses on six occasions. These include being (1) charged with Grand \nTheft Vehicles in 1994, convicted of Receiving Known Stolen Property, and sentenced to one day \nin jail and 36 months of probation; (2) charged with Rape by Force or Fear, Rape Victim Drugged, \nEscape Attempt Special Circumstances, and two counts of Sexual Intercourse with a Minor Special \n4 Directive \u00b6 E3.1.4 provides that applicants must admit or deny each listed SOR allegation. The Government should \nrequire applicants comply with the Directive by ensuring they respond appropriately to SOR allegations. Suspected \nfalsifications merit special consideration. \u201cAny incident of intentional material falsification . . . is of special concern. \nSuch conduct raises questions about an individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness and may be predictive \nof their willingness or ability to protect the national security.\u201d Directive, Encl.2, App. A \u00b6 2(i). See also Id. at \u00b6 15. \n5 Besides these four incidents, Applicant also admitted to an allegation (SOR \u00b6 1.n, discussed above) for which there \nwas no other supporting evidence and the Judge\u2019s favorable finding regarding it was not arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \nCircumstances in 1997, convicted of the Escape charge and two counts of Sex with a Minor, and \nsentenced to 365 days in jail and 36 months of probation; (3) convicted of Manufacture or \nPossession of a Dangerous Weapon in 2009 and sentenced to 16 months of confinement; (4) \nconvicted of DUI Alcohol/0.08 Percent in 2012 and sentenced to 36 months of probation, 10 days \nin jail (suspended), fined, and ordered to pay restitution; (5) charged with DUI Alcohol/Drugs, \nDriving While License Suspended, Driving Without Interlock Device in 2013, convicted of DUI \nand Driving While License Suspended, and sentenced to 30 days in jail (suspended), and fined; \nand (6) charged with two counts each of DUI Alcohol/Drugs, DUI Alcohol/0.08 Percent, Driving \nWhile License Suspended in 2015, convicted of DUI, and sentenced to 90 days in jail (converted \nto work release), $2,500 fine, and three to five years of probation. GE 1, 5, and 6. He was also \narrested for and charged with Driving While License Suspended and DUI in 2016, but the record \nevidence reflects no disposition of those offenses. GE 6. In short, Applicant has a lengthy history \nof criminal behavior that includes the commission of serious crimes for which he was incarcerated \nfor significant periods. Applicant had the burden of mitigating the security concerns arising from \nthat behavior. \nThe lack of mitigating evidence in the record is notable. In responding the SOR, Applicant \nprovided no evidence or explanations beyond admitting to all but two of the Guideline J \nallegations, and he failed to submit any response to the FORM. Applicant failed to provide \nevidence to corroborate his claims of a changed life, participation in AA, work performance, etc.  \nThe Judge\u2019s favorable findings were based upon portions of Applicant\u2019s SCA and a selective \nconsideration of Applicant\u2019s 2019 interview summary. Beyond this, there is no evidence of any \nkind in the record, and certainly none from Applicant, that bears favorably on the issues of \nmitigation or rehabilitation.  \nIn his Guideline J analysis, the Judge placed great weight on an absence of evidence of \ncriminal conduct since 2016. However, there is no hard and fast rule that can be applied to the \nquestion of the recency of security-significant matters. As we observed in a prior similar case, the \nextent to which criminal conduct has been attenuated by the passage of time must take into account \nthe extent of that activity and its inherent seriousness. In reversing a favorable decision, we stated \nthat the Judge \u201cfail[ed] to explain why a pattern of arrests that spans a period of over twenty years \nand includes carrying a dangerous weapon, domestic disturbance, assault on a minor, \ncommunicating threatening language . . . and DUI\u201d is not recent simply due to the lapse of time \nbetween the date of the last offense and the close of the record. ISCR Case No. 05-00448 at 4-5 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 1, 2007). We reach a similar conclusion in the case before us. Given the paucity \nof mitigating evidence, it was error for the Judge to conclude that the mere passage of time was \nsufficient to mitigate Applicant\u2019s serious misdeeds over a period of more than twenty years. \nIndeed, Applicant went from 2003 until 20096 without arrests or charges after which he resumed \ncommitting offenses, including a felony. This vitiates the Judge\u2019s conclusions about how much \ntime should pass before Applicant\u2019s offenses lose their significance due to age, and it undermines \na determination that Applicant\u2019s history of misconduct does not cast doubt on his current \ntrustworthiness and reliability. \n6 The FBI record reflects that Applicant was \u201carrested or received\u201d in 2008 for \u201cinflict corporal inj spouse cohab\u201d and \nfurther indicates \u201creleased/detention only.\u201d GE 6 at 3. In his background interview, Applicant indicated he learned \nof a warrant for his arrest and turned himself in at the police station. It is possible Applicant was merely detained for \nthat suspected offense, fingerprinted, and then released. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                       \n \nAs Department Counsel asserts, \u201csentencing for each of the convictions afforded Applicant \nample opportunities to learn . . . in the form of jail time, probation time, alcohol classes, and fines, \nyet . . . he continued to repeat the same behaviors[.]\u201d Appeal Brief at 32. It is not enough that the \nrecord contains some evidence that a person might find favorable. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 20\u00ad\n02990 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 19, 2022) (\u201cThe presence of some mitigating evidence does not compel \na Judge to make a favorable security clearance decision\u201d). To the contrary, the national security \ninterest requires that an applicant must meet the standard set forth in Egan, and all doubt as to the \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a clearance be resolved in favor of the national security. The Judge\u2019s \ndecision fails on this score.            \nGiven the totality of the record evidence, such favorable, uncorroborated, information as \nthe Judge selectively drew from Item 5, was not sufficient to meet Applicant\u2019s burden of \npersuasion under the Egan standard.

Foreman denied \nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 \nand E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in his findings of \nfact and whether the Judge\u2019s adverse decision was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nConsistent with the following, we affirm. \nUnder Guideline G, the SOR alleged that Applicant consumed alcohol at times to excess \nfrom about 1986 to January 2020; that he was charged with driving under the influence in 1990 \nand was convicted of reckless driving; that he was diagnosed with Alcohol Dependence in 2014; \nthat he continued to consumed alcohol after receiving advice in 2020 from a psychiatrist not to do \nso while taking prescribed medications; and that, in 2020, a licensed psychologist diagnosed him \nwith Alcohol Use Disorder (Moderate), gave him a guarded prognosis, and determined his \ncontinued use of alcohol potentially posed a risk to his judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness \nconcerning classified information.

In \ngeneral, he cites to his hearing testimony to challenge conclusions the Judge made about the \napplication of certain mitigating conditions. For example, he argues that the Judge \u201crelied on \nmischaracterized reports of maladaptive alcohol use from early 2020 to support his flawed \nconclusion.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 6.  He is referring to the licensed psychologist\u2019s 2020 report that, in \npart, discusses treatment he received from a psychiatrist. GE 4. His brief also contends he was \nimproperly diagnosed with alcohol use disorder, and the psychologist\u2019s opinions were based on \nincorrect facts and miscommunications. These arguments are not persuasive. No rule of evidence \ncompels the acceptance of a witness\u2019s testimony. As the trier of fact, the Judge is responsible for \nassessing conflicting evidence and resolving such conflicts based upon a careful evaluation of \nfactors such as the comparative reliability, plausibility, and ultimate truthfulness of conflicting \npieces of evidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-06723 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 14, 2007). We find \nno error in the Judge giving more weight to the diagnoses and opinions of medical professionals \nthan to Applicant\u2019s contradictory testimony or statements. Applicant has not identified any \nharmful errors in the Judge\u2019s application of the mitigating conditions. \nApplicant claims that he cannot tell whether the Judge found for or against him on a \nmitigating condition. In making this argument, he is apparently contending there is a contradiction \nbetween the Judge\u2019s conclusion that the mitigating condition was not established and the Judge\u2019s \nformal finding in favor of him on one of the SOR allegations.  The conclusion and formal finding \nin question are not contradictory.  A favorable finding on an SOR allegation can be made without \napplying mitigating conditions. For example, a Judge can find in favor of an applicant on an \nallegation because the Government simply failed to meet its burden of production on that \nallegation.  \nIn his brief, Applicant highlights evidence favorable to him. In doing so, he argues the \nJudge improperly weighed the evidence and did not properly consider various mitigating \nconditions and the whole-person factors. He contends, for example, that his financial problems \narose during a difficult time in his life, that he has not experienced any additional problems of that \nnature since his marital separation, and that he has been working with professionals to resolve \nthose problems. Such arguments do not demonstrate harmful error. The presence of some \nmitigating evidence does not alone compel the Judge to make a favorable security clearance \ndecision. As the trier of fact, the Judge has to weigh the evidence as a whole and decide whether \nthe favorable evidence outweighs the unfavorable evidence, or vice versa. A party\u2019s disagreement \nwith the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an ability to argue for a different interpretation of \nthe evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence or reached \nconclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n19-01431 at 4 (App. Bd. Mar. 31, 2020). \nApplicant further notes the Judge erred by referring to Guideline J in the decision and \nindicates this may be a typographical error. We agree. Viewed in light of the decision as a whole, \nthis is a harmless typographical error. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 04-03795 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 25, \n2007). \nApplicant failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful error. The Judge examined \nthe relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact: The Judge\u2019s factual findings are summarized below, in pertinent part: Applicant is in his late forties and single, with two adult children. The SOR alleges that Applicant has child support arrearages totaling approximately $39,000. The allegation is supported by credit bureau reports from 2018 and 2021. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant explained that the arrearage was previously adjudicated at a security clearance hearing in 2010, at which time the balance was $28,000. At the 2010 hearing, Applicant presented evidence that he had established a payment plan to address the debt. Under the plan, $400 would be withheld from his monthly wages, with $247 directed to his ongoing support obligation and $153 applied to the arrearage. It appears from the 2010 decision that the plan had been recently established and that Applicant had not yet made any payments at the time of his May 2010 hearing. Since the 2010 decision, the arrearages have increased to the alleged amount. In his May 2018 SCA, Applicant stated that he is paying the minimum amount required on his debt and attempting to have it recalculated. In his SOR answer, Applicant stated that his child support payments have been automatically withheld from his wages for many years, but that those payments are not reflected in the balance on his credit report.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nJanuary 20, 2022, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant \nrequested a decision on the written record. The Government\u2019s written case was submitted in \nFebruary 2022. A copy of the file of relevant material (FORM) was provided to Applicant, and \nhe submitted documents in response. On September 13, 2022, after consideration of the record, \nAdministrative Judge Carol G. Ricciardello denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged a child support arrearage and a delinquent medical account. Applicant \ndenied both allegations. The Judge found favorably for Applicant on the medical account and \nadversely on the child support arrearage. On appeal, Applicant asserts that the Judge improperly \nrelied on credit reports, that she was biased, and that she did not receive all the evidence that he \nsubmitted. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact: The Judge\u2019s factual findings are summarized below, in \npertinent part: \nApplicant is in his late forties and single, with two adult children. The SOR alleges that \nApplicant has child support arrearages totaling approximately $39,000. \nThe allegation is \nsupported by credit bureau reports from 2018 and 2021.  \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant explained that the arrearage was previously \nadjudicated at a security clearance hearing in 2010, at which time the balance was $28,000. At the \n2010 hearing, Applicant presented evidence that he had established a payment plan to address the \ndebt.  Under the plan, $400 would be withheld from his monthly wages, with $247 directed to his \nongoing support obligation and $153 applied to the arrearage. It appears from the 2010 decision \nthat the plan had been recently established and that Applicant had not yet made any payments at \nthe time of his May 2010 hearing. Since the 2010 decision, the arrearages have increased to the \nalleged amount. \nIn his May 2018 SCA, Applicant stated that he is paying the minimum amount required on \nhis debt and attempting to have it recalculated.  In his SOR answer, Applicant stated that his child \nsupport payments have been automatically withheld from his wages for many years, but that those \npayments are not reflected in the balance on his credit report. He provided pay stubs for October \n\u2013 December 2013, which reflected $4,450 in child support payments for 2013. \nApplicant provided a copy of a March 2016 email from a case worker in the state where \nthe child support order was entered.  In the email, the case worker stated that the state did not add \ninterest to Applicant\u2019s child support arrears; that the amount due reflected the actual court ordered \npayments; that the agency had not received any payments from Applicant since October 2013; that \nthey had received a payment of approximately $978 in June 2015 \u201cas a result of a hit on \n[Applicant\u2019s] bank account\u201d; and that the case worker would agree to payments of $250 per month \nafter the court-ordered support obligation terminated in May 2016 upon emancipation of one of \nthe children.  Decision at 3, citing to AE F.   \nApplicant provided receipts indicating he made payments of $250 in April 2016 and May \n2016 and payments of $150 in February 2017, March 2017, and January 2018. He did not provide \nevidence to show any additional payments made since his 2010 hearing, other than the 2013 \npayments made through his employer. Decision at 2\u20133, citing to Item 3; AE G to J. \nJudge\u2019s Analysis: The Judge\u2019s analysis is quoted below, in pertinent part: \nApplicant\u2019s child-support arrearages have existed for many years. He has \nrepeatedly made numerous claims that he has made payments; should be given \ncredit when the children lived with him; he should be given credit for air fare he \npaid; and that he made payments to other states that were not credited. He noted on \nhis 2018 SCA that he was having the state where the order was issued recalculate \nwhat he owed. It has been four years since that statement, and he has not provided \nevidence of action he has taken. Applicant may have legitimate claims for why his \narrearages should be reduced, but he has provided insufficient evidence to me to \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nmake that determination. He needs to resolve it with the state and he has not. The \nevidence he provided does not show he has consistently been making payments. \nApplicant has not resolved his child-support arrearages. There is insufficient \nevidence this debt was beyond his control. He has not presented evidence that he \nhas acted responsibly, that there are clear indications the debt is being resolved, or \nhe made a good-faith effort to repay the arrearages. [The mitigating conditions] do \nnot apply.  [Decision at 6\u20137.] \nDiscussion \nReliance on Credit Reports \nApplicant argues that the Judge erred in \u201caccepting uncalculated and falsely reported sums\u201d \non his credit reports, as he disputes the amount owed for child support. Appeal Brief at 3. Putting \naside Applicant\u2019s failure to object to the Judge\u2019s consideration of these documents, we note that \ncredit reports are generally admissible as part of the Government\u2019s case in chief. A credit report \nqualifies as a record compiled or created in the regular course of business and, therefore, is \nadmissible without an authenticating witness. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20. There is nothing on the face \nof the challenged documents to suggest that they are other than what they appear to be. The Judge \ndid not abuse her discretion by admitting and relying upon the credit reports.\u201d See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 18-00310 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2018). \nBias \nApplicant alleges bias, based on the fact that the evidence in the current case is \u201cthe same \ndisputed and incorrect information\u201d as at his 2010 hearing and that the Judge in 2010 found \nfavorably for him.  Appeal Brief at 1. We do not find Applicant\u2019s argument convincing. There is \na rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking to overcome \nthat presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion. The issue is not whether Applicant personally \nbelieves the Judge was biased or prejudiced against Applicant. Rather, the issue is whether the \nrecord contains any indication the Judge acted in a manner that would lead a reasonable person to \nquestion the fairness and impartiality of the Judge. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 20-02787 at 3\u20134 \n(App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2022). \nThe evidence of record establishes that Applicant faced an arrearage of approximately \n$28,000 in 2010; that he entered into a payment plan around the time of his May 2010 hearing; \nthat the Judge relied upon this payment plan in finding the debt mitigated; that Applicant made \nsome payments in 2013; that he made five payments between April 2016 and January 2018; and \nthat his arrearage had increased to approximately $39,000 by August 2018. In sum, the Judge in \nthe case at hand faced significantly different facts than did her counterpart in 2010 and based her \ndecision squarely on what Applicant has done\u2014or failed to do\u2014since his last hearing. Applicant \nhas failed to meet the heavy burden associated with a demonstration of bias on appeal.  \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMissing Evidence \nApplicant also alleges that the Judge received incomplete documents due to a \u201cmishandling \nof evidence.\u201d Appeal Brief at 5. He asserts that his response to the SOR included a \u201cfive-page \ndocument showing evidence of payments paid from 2016 to 2018 through automated payments by \n[credit union].\u201d Id. Our review of the record confirms that Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR \ncontained all documents he listed as attached to it. Although it does not include the five pages \nfrom the credit union, he submitted what appear to be those documents with his response to the \nFORM, and the Judge explicitly referenced those payments.  See Decision at 3.  We find no basis \nto conclude that evidence was mishandled or that the Judge failed to receive any evidence that \nApplicant submitted. \nIn conclusion, Applicant has not identified any harmful error in the Judge\u2019s handling of his \ncase or in her decision. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory \nexplanation for her decision.  The decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is \nthat a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national \nsecurity.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

On \nNovember 23, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of \nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) of DoD \nDirective 5220.6 (January 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a decision on \nthe written record. On March 31, 2022, after the record closed, Defense Office of Hearings and \nAppeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge LeRoy F. Foreman denied Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nOn appeal, Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s consideration of a resolved debt, highlights \nthat he is in a debt consolidation program, and submits additional evidence.

Employed by federal contractors since February 2006, he \nwas cleared for a position of public trust in 2007 after disclosing delinquent debts. In his current \nsecurity clearance application (SCA), Applicant disclosed two delinquent debts: a dental bill from \n2014 and a car-repair bill in 2015. The car repair account was satisfied in 2019. \nThe SOR alleges 11 delinquent debts totaling about $108,900. In April 2019, Applicant \nretained a law firm to assist him in resolving his debts. He enrolled in a 42-month program with \nan estimated completion date of October 2022 and monthly payments of $285. He has increased \nhis payments to $355/month.  His estimated completion date is now in 2025.  \nOf the 11 delinquent debts alleged, five are federal student loans totaling about $91,100 \nthat became delinquent in 2017. These student loans are not included in the law firm\u2019s program.  \nSince March 2020, Applicant\u2019s student loans have been in forbearance under the Coronavirus Aid, \nRelief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act). In August 2020, Applicant signed an agreement \nto participate in a loan rehabilitation program for these loans, paying $133/month, and has stated \nhis intent to begin payment when the forbearance ends. Notwithstanding the forbearance, \nApplicant\u2019s student loans were delinquent well before the forbearance went into effect, and he has \nnot yet completed a loan rehabilitation program. \u201cI am not convinced that he will make the \nrequired payments on his student loans when they are no longer in forbearance.\u201d  Decision at 3. \nThe remaining six SOR allegations are consumer and auto loan debts that total about \n$17,800. Several debts are included in the law firm\u2019s program. While in this program, Applicant \nhas settled and paid one, settled two, and is negotiating one more. \nApplicant\u2019s delinquent debts are recent, numerous, and not incurred under circumstances \nmarking recurrence unlikely. Although Applicant has recently experienced events beyond his \ncontrol, those situations occurred after the student loans and consumer debts were delinquent. \nApplicant did not hire the law firm to assist him in resolving his consumer debts until his security \nclearance was in jeopardy. He has not rehabilitated his student loans or begun payments. He has \noffered limited evidence about his overall income and expenses, and has not persuasively \nexplained why so many debts became delinquent in 2017 and 2018, while he was employed.  \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant highlights that the Judge referenced his car repair bill of $7,000, \nstates that debt has been resolved, and argues that the Judge should not have considered the debt \nin his decision.  The debt in issue was not alleged in the SOR.  As clear from the summary above, \nthe Judge mentioned the debt as one disclosed by Applicant on his SCA, acknowledged that it was \nresolved, and did not reference it again. Our review confirms that the Judge did not consider that \nparticular debt for any purpose. This claim of error lacks merit. \nSecond, Applicant highlights that he is enrolled in a debt consolidation plan and questions \nwhether applicants must be debt-free before granting a clearance: \u201cIs it the government\u2019s position \nthat you can only hold a clearance if you are debt free before employment?

The 11 delinquent debts alleged in the SOR were \na sufficient basis for the Judge to deny Applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility.  \nApplicant makes no other assertion of harmful error on the part of the Judge. However, \nApplicant re-states information previously provided to the Judge, submits documents previously \nconsidered, and submits new evidence as well.

The Judge found \nagainst Applicant on allegations that asserted he failed to file his Federal income tax return for \n2016 as required, that he was indebted to the Federal Government for $1,500 in delinquent taxes, \nthat he had a collection account of about $43,000, and that he was evicted from a rental property \nin 2017 and owes the lessor of about $2,700.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant asserts the Judge did not take into account that alleged debts \nwere settled or paid off. In support of that claim, he submits documents concerning those debts \nthat were admitted into evidence at the hearing. Most of these documents, however, pertain to \nSOR allegations that the Judge found in favor of Applicant. This assignment of error has no merit.  \nApplicant contends that the Judge did not take into account the progress he has made in \nresolving judgments and asserts that, if his clearance is reinstated, he will stay current on his debts.  \nNone of his arguments are enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the \nrecord evidence or to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law.

His son\u2019s substance abuse issues cost him his scholarship, and Applicant paid about $100,000 for college tuition. Around 2015, Applicant decided to delay mortgage payments, which caused his credit score to decrease and interest rates for borrowing to increase. He borrowed from friends to reduce interest expenses. Unable to sell his house for market reasons, Applicant was also unable to renegotiate the first mortgage and home equity loan and was close to foreclosure by 2017.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nOctober 23, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial Considerations) and \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as \namended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On June 9, 2022, after the hearing, Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Mark Harvey denied Applicant\u2019s \nrequest for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline F, the SOR alleged 17 financial concerns. The Judge found favorably for \nApplicant on 16 and adversely on one. Under Guideline E, the SOR makes two allegations: first, \nthat Applicant was terminated from employment in 2018 for misusing his corporate credit card, \nmaking payments for that card that were returned for insufficient funds, and borrowing \napproximately $68,000 from other employees; and, second, that Applicant provided financial \nsupport from November 2013 through at least 2017 to two strippers, one of whom was also a \nprostitute.  The Judge found adversely to Applicant on both Guideline E allegations.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether the Judge erred in his findings of \nfact and whether he failed to consider all available evidence in applying the mitigating conditions, \nrendering his adverse decision arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Consistent with the \nfollowing, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact: The Judge\u2019s findings are summarized in pertinent part. \nApplicant is sixty years old. After graduating college in 1984, he served on active duty \nuntil 1992 and has worked for defense contractors since 1993. Married in 1983, Applicant \ndivorced in 2018 and has three adult children. \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to several factors, including his spouse\u2019s \nexcessive alcohol consumption, their separation and ultimate divorce, and assistance to one of his \nsons who struggled with substance abuse. His son\u2019s substance abuse issues cost him his \nscholarship, and Applicant paid about $100,000 for college tuition.  \nAround 2015, Applicant decided to delay mortgage payments, which caused his credit \nscore to decrease and interest rates for borrowing to increase. He borrowed from friends to reduce \ninterest expenses. Unable to sell his house for market reasons, Applicant was also unable to \nrenegotiate the first mortgage and home equity loan and was close to foreclosure by 2017. \nApplicant anticipated receiving two bonuses totaling about $55,000 in early 2018 and \nplanned to use those funds to resolve several debts. However, he was terminated from his \nemployment in January 2018 prior to receiving the bonuses. \nAlthough he secured new \nemployment as a DoD contractor, he took an initial $60,000 cut in annual pay and lost an additional \n$60,000 in annual salary as he again switched employment. \nApplicant\u2019s cuts in pay reduced his annual salary to $120,000. After deductions for \nalimony payments and medical bills, Applicant qualified for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. In October \n2020, Applicant\u2019s nonpriority unsecured debts totaling approximately $474,000 were discharged. \nApplicant\u2019s bankruptcy petition also revealed priority debts that totaled approximately $88,000, to \ninclude student loans, delinquent Federal taxes for tax years (TY) 2017 and 2018 of about $8,000 \nand $23,000, and delinquent state taxes for TY 2018 of $21,000. Shortly after the October 2020 \ndischarge of his debts, Applicant received a $40,000 raise. As of March 2022, his monthly gross \nincome (AGI) was $14,000.  \nThe SOR alleges a Federal tax debt of $19,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.a.). Applicant resolved a Federal \ntax debt for TY 2017 in June 2020. Applicant\u2019s AGI for TY 2018 was almost $400,000, in part \nbecause he withdrew savings from a 401(k) account to pay debts. As of March 2022, his IRS debt \nfor TY 2018 was about $37,000. Since 2019, his income tax refunds have been applied to his \nFederal tax debt. In 2021, Applicant made only two payments to the IRS to address his tax debt \nfor TY 2018.  In January 2022, he began a payment plan of $526/month, and his March 2022 IRS \ntax transcript for TY 2018 reflected his first two payments under that plan. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant is current on a repayment plan for his 2018 state tax debt (SOR \u00b6 1.b.). The \ndebts alleged at SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c. through 1.q. are a mix of consumer debts, medical debts, judgments, \nand loans from coworkers. All fifteen debts and judgments were discharged in Applicant\u2019s \nOctober 2020 bankruptcy.  \nPersonal Conduct \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant was terminated from his job in January 2018 for using his \ncorporate credit card for personal expenses, paying for the card with checks returned for \ninsufficient funds on about six occasions, and borrowing about $68,000 from various employees. \nApplicant stated that prior to 2016 there was no prohibition against use of the corporate card for \npersonal expenses if the card was paid off every month, but did not provide any documents to \nsupport this assertion.  In 2016, Applicant learned that use of the credit card for personal expenses \nwas prohibited, but was advised that the primary corporate concern was that the card was paid off \non a monthly basis. In October 2017, Applicant missed a payment on the card. He was suspended \nin December 2017 and terminated in January 2018 \nApplicant stated that he made the payments using electronic fund transfers, some of which \nwere returned for insufficient funds. Applicant knew some of his EFTs would be returned at the \ntime he filed them. He did not fully repay the debt he generated using his corporate credit card, \nand the remainder was discharged in his bankruptcy. \nBecause of concern about repaying the corporate credit card, Applicant borrowed sums \nfrom subordinates ranging from $1,000 to $10,000. Applicant was the approval authority for \nbonuses for some of the subordinates who lent him funds. He did not disclose to his supervisor \nthat he was borrowing from subordinates because he did not want to compromise his supervisor.  \nApplicant stated that the loans were voluntary and based on friendship, and he has repaid the loans. \nIn approximately 2015 to 2016, Applicant borrowed funds from four former coworkers \ntotaling $225,000.  These four debts were discharged through bankruptcy.  \nThe SOR also alleges that, from November 2013 to at least 2017, Applicant provided \nfinancial support to two strippers, one of whom was also a prostitute. In November 2013, \nApplicant met L at a strip club he frequented. To enable L to change her lifestyle, Applicant \ninitially paid for her hotel rooms, subsequently rented an apartment for her, and eventually allowed \nher to live at his home for a period.  Additionally, he paid for her drug-rehabilitation program.  At \nthe time of his hearing in April 2022, Applicant was providing about $200 monthly to help with \nexpenses, as well as an occasional larger lump sum. In 2015, Applicant met stripper A at the same \nclub. Stripper A had a pending felony charge because of drug involvement. Applicant paid her \ncourt fees and provided her with support to allow her to leave employment as a stripper. Stripper \nA also moved into his home for a period of time. At the time of Applicant\u2019s hearing, he estimated \nthat he was providing about $200 monthly to her for essentials. Applicant was sexually involved \nwith both L and A at some point in his relationship with each. \nHis intentions were to help L and A end their employments at the strip club and to \nassist in their drug rehabilitation. He believed his intervention in the lives of L and \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA saved their lives because they were headed down a negative path that would \nresult in a terrible outcome from drug abuse and the bad influence of working in a \nstrip club. [Decision at 7.] \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis:  The Judge\u2019s analysis is summarized in pertinent part. \nGuideline F \nApplicant described several circumstances beyond his control that adversely affected his \nfinances, to include medical and substance abuse problems of family members, with related losses \nof scholarship or employment. Other circumstances were not beyond Applicant\u2019s control, to \ninclude abuse of his corporate credit card, his job termination, and his payments to L and A.  \nApplicant resolved $474,000 in debts through Chapter 7 bankruptcy, and the debts in SOR \n1.c. through 1.q. are consequently mitigated. \u201cThe financial conduct leading up to the bankruptcy \ncontinues to be relevant.\u201d Decision at 10. The Federal tax debt alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.a. is not \nmitigated. Applicant has had a delinquent Federal income tax debt since 2018 and currently owes \nmore than $30,000 for TY 2018. During the last five years, he has earned over one million dollars.  \nHe did not prove that he was unable to make greater progress paying his Federal income tax debt.  \n\u201cUnder all the circumstances, he failed to establish mitigation of financial considerations security \nconcerns.\u201d Decision at 10\u201311. \nGuideline E \nApplicant admitted that he was terminated from his employment for using his credit card \nfor personal expenses, not paying off the credit card each month, and borrowing funds from various \nemployees. \nHe borrowed money from subordinates to whom he could provide benefits. \n\u201cBorrowing from subordinates under these circumstances creates a serious conflict of interest and \nshows poor judgment.\u201d Decision at 12. \nApplicant admitted that he provided financial support, as alleged, to L and A. They both \nworked in a strip club when he met them and at some point were involved with illegal drugs.  \nEngaging in sexual relations with strippers or users of illegal drugs is not criminal conduct, but \nraises serious judgment issues. Applicant was experiencing severe financial problems, including \nnot timely paying his Federal and state income taxes.  He was spending money in a strip club and \ngiving money to L and A that could instead have been used to pay his Federal income taxes, and \nhe continues to give money to both women even though his Federal incomes taxes are not fully \npaid. \u201cThere is no evidence that his current employer or community are aware of his abuse of his \ncorporate credit card, borrowing from subordinates, and payments to L and A. . . . Personal \nconduct security concerns are not mitigated.\u201d Decision at 12. \nDiscussion \nApplicant challenges the Judge\u2019s findings of fact and his application of the mitigating \nconditions in several regards. First, Applicant takes issue with the Judge\u2019s findings regarding \nabuse of the corporate credit card. Both at the hearing and on appeal, Applicant maintained that \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhe had a long history of using the corporate card for personal expenses, that such use was permitted \nas long as he made the monthly payment, and that, even when he was counseled that there was a \n\u201cnew policy\u201d prohibiting use for personal expenses, he was told \u201cto just pay my bill on time and \nthere would be no problem, clearly mixed signal guidance.\u201d Appeal Brief at 5. The Judge found \nthat Applicant provided no documentation that he was permitted to use his corporate credit card \nfor personal expenses. Applicant challenges this finding, noting that he was obligated to tell the \ntruth: \nBy adding a requirement for \u201cdocumentation\u201d the court departs from the rules \nguiding the proceeding and by extension rejects my testimony that I did not believe \nI was \u201cabusing\u201d the [credit] card. Throughout the judgment the Court continues to \nregard my use of the [credit] card as abuse. . . . The Court fails to recognize or \naccept my explanation of the circumstances for the conduct[.]  Appeal Brief at 6. \nWe construe this argument to be that the Judge did not comply with the criteria set forth in \nthe Directive for making and evaluating findings of fact. The standard that we use in evaluating \nthe sufficiency of a Judge\u2019s findings is set forth in Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1: \u201csuch relevant evidence \nas a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary \nevidence in the same record.\u201d Testimony is obviously evidence and, in an appropriate case, it can \nsupport sustainable findings on its own. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-02588 at 5 (App. Bd. Mar. \n5, 2019). However, the Board has previously stated a Judge is not required to accept testimony \nmerely because it is unrebutted. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 05-03554 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 23, 2007). \nAs a matter of common sense, the Judge may consider the lack of corroboration in determining \nthe weight to be given to that evidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-00151 at 7 (App. Bd. Dec. \n10, 2019). We find no error in the Judge\u2019s comment about a lack of corroborating evidence. \nMoreover, we note that Applicant\u2019s assertions are contradicted in large part by his employer\u2019s \nIncident Report of January 2018:  \nIn August 2017 [Applicant] had paid [his corporate card] account with checks that \nwere returned for insufficient funds. [Applicant] was counselled and it was \ndiscovered that [he] was using the account for personal matters and was told that it \nwas against policy to use the card for personal reasons. . . . After being counselled \nby [Management] that use of the Corporate card is prohibited he continued to use \nthe card for months after the meeting. [GE 2 at 2\u20133.] \nSecond, Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s findings and conclusions regarding his Federal \ntax debt, arguing that the Judge\u2019s timeline is incorrect, that the Judge fails to acknowledge his \npayments towards the debt, and that the Judge portrays \u201ca narrative of irresponsible behavior . . . \nby inaccurately citing concerns over money spent at strip clubs and on strippers while failing to \nrecognize that evidence clearly documents the tax debt was . . . long after I stopped going to strip \nclubs and strippers.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1\u20132. These arguments are unpersuasive. \nUnder Guideline F, the Judge determined that Applicant had not mitigated the Federal tax \ndebt, as he currently owes more than $30,000 for TY 2018 despite the fact that he has the funds \navailable to pay the debt. This conclusion is supported by the record, which confirms that \nApplicant made intermittent payments in 2021 and only began regular payments under a payment \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nplan in January 2022, fourteen months after issuance of the SOR and two months prior to his \nhearing. The timing of debt payments is relevant in evaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-00294 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2018). An applicant who begins to \nresolve security concerns only after having been placed on notice that his or her clearance is in \njeopardy may lack the judgment and willingness to follow rules and regulations when his or her \npersonal interests are not threatened. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01256 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 3, \n2018). \nApplicant takes issue with the Judge\u2019s comment that \u201c[t]he financial conduct leading up to \nthe bankruptcy continues to be relevant.\u201d Decision at 10. To the extent that Applicant is \ncontending the Judge could not consider the mitigated debts in his analysis of the remaining \nunmitigated debt (i.e., the Federal tax delinquency), we do not find that argument persuasive. A \nJudge is not required to analyze unmitigated debts in an isolated or piecemeal manner. An \napplicant\u2019s financial history is relevant in Guideline F cases. Even when a Judge concludes the \nsecurity concerns arising from certain alleged debts have been mitigated, those debts may remain \nrelevant in the Judge\u2019s analysis of the remaining Guideline F allegations.  For example, similar to \nthe Board\u2019s holdings involving consideration of non-alleged conduct, mitigated debts may be \nconsidered (a) in evaluating an applicant\u2019s evidence of extenuation, mitigation, or changed \ncircumstances; (b) in considering whether the applicant has demonstrated successful rehabilitation; \n(c) in assessing an applicant\u2019s credibility; and (d) in applying the whole-person concept. See, e.g., \nISCR Case No. 15-07369 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 16, 2017), addressing authorized purposes for which \nnon-alleged conduct may be considered. Depending on the circumstances of a case, mitigated \ndebts may remain relevant in assessing such matters as the recency and frequency of financial \nproblems, whether those problems are being resolved or are under control, whether they are \nunlikely to recur, and whether an applicant has acted responsibly. In this case, we find no error \nin the Judge\u2019s comment that Applicant\u2019s financial conduct leading up to the bankruptcy, which \ninvolved the mitigated debts, remained relevant.   \nUnder Guideline E, the Judge considered that Applicant was \u201cspending money in a strip \nclub and giving money to L and A\u201d during a timeframe in which he was experiencing \u201csevere \nfinancial problems, including not timely paying his Federal and state income taxes.\u201d Decision at \n12. He concluded that those payments \u201cestablish personal conduct judgment concerns.\u201d Again, \nthis conclusion is supported by the record, which confirms that Applicant has owed delinquent \nFederal taxes since he filed his TY 2017 tax return in 2018, that Applicant frequented strip clubs \nuntil approximately 2018, and that he continued financial support to the two women whom he met \nthere through at least the date of his hearing. (AE C at 1; Tr. at 73\u201374, 93.) \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s brief is fundamentally an argument that the Judge failed to \nconsider or misweighed mitigating evidence. For example, Applicant highlights evidence, such \nas his son\u2019s overdose, and contends the Judge did not acknowledge that evidence. The Judge, \nhowever, found that Applicant\u2019s son lost his college scholarship due to substance abuse. A Judge \nis not required to discuss each and every piece of record evidence, which would be a practical \nimpossibility. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-01500 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015). None of \nApplicant\u2019s arguments are enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of the \nrecord evidence or to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law. Moreover, the Judge complied with the requirements of the \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDirective in his whole-person analysis by considering all evidence of record in reaching his \ndecision.

Those documents constitute new evidence that the Appeal Board is prohibited from \nconsidering.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.  \nIn the decision, the Judge concluded that Applicant failed to present sufficient evidence to \nmitigate the security concerns arising from the three debts and noted the absence of certain \ncorroborating documentation. On appeal, Applicant argues the Judge never asked for those \ndocuments. To the extent that Applicant is contending the Judge erred in failing to request those \ndocuments, we find no merit in that argument. There is no requirement for a judge to ask applicants \nfor specific evidence. Having admitted the delinquent debts at issue, the burden was on Applicant \nto mitigate the security concerns arising from those debts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The Judge\u2019s \ncomments in question were just observations that Applicant failed to present certain types of \nmitigating evidence. \nApplicant claims the Judge erred in finding that he has been making around $93,000 a year \nsince being hired by his current employer in 2019. At the February 2022 hearing, Applicant \ntestified he started working for his current employer in 2019 and his \u201ccurrent income\u201d was $93,000 \nannually. Tr. at 28-29. In his brief, he asserts that he did not earn that amount when first hired \nby his current employer and correctly notes he was not asked at the hearing how long he had been \nearning that amount. Even though the Judge\u2019s finding in question is not fully supported by \nsubstantial evidence, this error is harmless because it did not likely affect the outcome of the case. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01220 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 1, 2020). \nThe balance of Applicant\u2019s arguments is a disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the \nevidence. For example, he argues that his professional knowledge, expertise, and commitment has \nnever been questioned; notes that he has received accolades and awards for his work performance; \nand contends that he has upheld the highest professional standards. None of his arguments, \nhowever, are sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 21-00362 at 4 (App. Bd. May \n4, 2022). \nApplicant also argues denial of his security clearance would be detrimental to his \nfinancial recovery. The Directive, however, does not permit us to consider the impact of an \nunfavorable decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01206 at 2 (App. Bd. May 13, 2020).  \nApplicant failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful errors. The Judge examined \nthe relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision.

Applicant \nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issue on appeal: whether the Judge\u2019s decision was arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nIn her late 30s, Applicant is married with four children. She has earned a bachelor\u2019s degree \nand is working on a master\u2019s degree. Since 2015, she has worked for a defense contractor. The \nSOR contains four allegations. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn 2001, Applicant pled guilty in Federal court to importing cocaine into the United States. \nThis charge arose when authorities discovered 3.1 pounds of cocaine concealed in her suitcase \nupon her return to the U.S. from a Caribbean country. A charge of possessing cocaine with the \nintent to distribute was dismissed.  In 2002, she was sentenced to 30 months of imprisonment and \n4 years of supervised probation. She served 14 months of combined imprisonment and Federal \nboot camp.  Her probation ended in 2004. She attributed this offense to being na\u00efve and ignorant. \nIn 2011, Applicant was charged with aggravated battery with a deadly weapon (a felony), \naggravated assault with a deadly weapon (a felony), and battery. These charges arose from an \naltercation with other women outside a restaurant/night club. A police report reflects that, during \nthe incident, Applicant intentionally drove at and struck an individual with a vehicle. She claimed \nshe was innocent of the charges because she was acting in self-defense. Based on an attorney\u2019s \nadvice, however, she pled guilty to battery and assault.  In 2012, she completed a six-month anger \nmanagement class. Having successfully completed probation, this incident did not result in a \nconviction. During her background interview, she indicated she bumped the woman when she was \nbacking the vehicle.  At the hearing, she denied she struck the women with the vehicle.  \nThe other SOR allegations are related. In January 2019, two public assistance fraud \ncharges (felonies) were brought against Applicant. These involved Applicant receiving (1) food \nstamps and Medicaid and (2) school readiness services during periods of employment. One charge \nalleged she committed the offense occurred between December 2015 and December 2016, while \nthe other alleged she committed the offense between April 2015 and December 2016. She pled \nnolo contendere to both charges and received deferred adjudication. In the fall of 2019, she was \nsentenced to pay about $5,000 in restitution for one charge and about $11,000 for the other. She \nwas also sentenced to complete an anti-theft class and was placed on probation until 2024. After \ncompleting the terms of her sentence to include restitution, her probation was terminated in 2020. \nApplicant\u2019s \u201cclaim that she would have received the public assistance even if she \naccurately reported her income is not credible.\u201d Decision at 8. She repeated that claim in her \nsecurity clearance application, background interview, and at the hearing. Such non-alleged \nconduct could be considered in evaluating the mitigating evidence, in determining whether \nrehabilitation has been sufficiently demonstrated, and in analyzing the whole-person concept. \n\u201cHer misstatements about the materiality of her false income information shows her failure to \naccept full responsibility for her fraudulent behavior, and it shows a lack of rehabilitation.\u201d Id. at \n9. \u201cAfter careful assessment of Applicant\u2019s case in mitigation, her criminal conduct continues to \ncast doubt on [her] current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Criminal conduct \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated at this time.\u201d Id at 8. \nDiscussion \nApplicant does not dispute any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact, but rather argues \nthe Judge analyzed the evidence in an arbitrary and capricious manner. More specifically, she \ncontends the Judge failed to consider all of the evidence and erred in his analysis of the mitigating \nconditions and whole-person factors.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nOctober 16, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) of Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn March 16, 2022, after the close of the record, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nJudge Richard A. Cefola granted Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Department Counsel \nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nIn his appeal brief, Department Counsel raised the following issues: whether the Judge\u2019s \nanalysis is unsupported by the record evidence, whether he substituted a credibility determination \nfor record evidence, and whether his decision is arbitrary, capricious, and contrary to law. \nConsistent with the following, we reverse. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact: The Judge\u2019s factual findings are summarized below: \nApplicant is 64 years old. Divorced, he has two adult children, ages 26 and 29. He has \nheld a security clearance intermittently since 1985 and has been employed in his current defense \ncontractor position since September 2018. From 2003 until 2009, Applicant owned a firm at which \nhe worked as a software engineer. He employed his children, who were minors at the time, paying \nthem about $20,000 a year. When his company failed in 2009, Applicant filed for unemployment \nbenefits on behalf of his minor children. The benefits ran for 99 weeks, ending in mid-2011. Upon \nreceipt of the unemployment checks, Applicant placed them into his children\u2019s bank accounts. \nIn December of 2015, Applicant was charged with five felonies: two counts of False \nStatement, Representation, or Concealment, two counts of Identity Theft \u2013 Obtain Credit with \nOther\u2019s Identity, and Grand Theft. Applicant denies that he committed the felonies, but pled guilty \nto a misdemeanor \u2014Failure to Post Benefit Rights in his work place. Applicant was placed on \nprobation until March 2022 and was ordered to pay $45,000 in restitution, which he states has been \npaid and is currently in civil litigation. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis:  The Judge\u2019s substantive analysis is quoted below, in its entirety: \nApplicant was convicted of a misdemeanor offense in 2017. He was placed \non probation for five years, which ends this month, March of 2022. The evidence \nestablishes three [Guideline J] disqualifying conditions.1 \n. \n. \n. \nMore than ten years have passed since the Applicant\u2019s alleged felonious \nconduct, and his admitted misdemeanor conduct. Within the month of this writing, \nhis probation is ending. He provided evidence of successful work with his \nemployer. (citations omitted.) The evidence does establish mitigation under \n[Adjudicative Guideline \u00b6\u00b6 32(a) and 32(d)].2 Criminal Conduct is found for \nApplicant. \n1 AG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would be unlikely to affect a national \nsecurity eligibility decision, but which in combination cast doubt on the individual\u2019s judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; AG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an admission, and \nmatters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the person was formally charged, \nformally prosecuted or convicted; and AG \u00b6 31(c): individual is currently on parole or probation. Directive, \nEncl. 2, App. A. \n2 AG \u00b6 32 (a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it happened under such \nunusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and AG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including \nbut not limited to the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, compliance with the \nterms of parole or probation, job training or higher education, good employment record, or constructive \ncommunity involvement. Directive, Encl. 2, App. A. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n. . . \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guideline J in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) \nwere addressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is well respected in the workplace and in his community. (citations \nomitted.) Overall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, \nI conclude Applicant mitigated the Criminal Conduct security concerns. [Decision \nat 4\u20135.] \nDiscussion \nA Judge is required to \u201cexamine the relevant data and articulate a satisfactory explanation \nfor\u201d the decision, \u201cincluding a \u2018rational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u2019\u201d \nMotor Vehicle Mfrs. Ass\u2019n of the United States v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 463 U.S. 29, 43 \n(1983) (quoting Burlington Truck Lines, Inc. v. United States, 371 U.S. 156, 168 (1962)). \u201cThe \ngeneral standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the interests \nof the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). \u201cAny doubt \nconcerning personnel being considered for national security eligibility will be resolved in favor of \nthe national security.\u201d Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 2(b). The Appeal Board may reverse the \nJudge\u2019s decision to grant, deny, or revoke a security clearance if it is arbitrary, capricious, or \ncontrary to law.  Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.32.3 and E3.1.33.3. \nIn deciding whether the Judge\u2019s rulings or conclusions are arbitrary and capricious, we will \nreview the Judge\u2019s decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails \nto articulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between \nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error \nof judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 97-0435 at 3 (App. Bd. Jul. 14, 1998). \nThis decision fails in each of these regards. We focus on the most dispositive below. \nFailure to Examine Relevant Evidence \nThe documents of record and Applicant\u2019s testimony at hearing contained relevant evidence \nthat the Judge failed to examine in his findings of fact and his analysis, to include: \nIn 1999, Applicant started his own firm, which \u201chire[d] professional engineers and \ncontract[ed] out their expertise to various aerospace companies working with the government on \ntheir own defense contracts.\u201d AE A at 1.

Tr. at 28, 29, 31. Instead, Applicant states, they were to do their \nchores at home. \u201cBasically, it was an allowance, but it was structured through a . . . company.\u201d \nId. at 29. Applicant\u2019s statement that he consulted with his accountant prior to putting his children \non his firm\u2019s payroll is uncorroborated.  Tr. at 28.  \nFrom at least 2003 through 2009, Applicant\u2019s company worked on a government contract \nwith a major defense contractor and \u201cemployed\u201d his two minor children. GE 1 at 9\u201310; Answer \nto SOR at 2\u20133. Under cross-examination at hearing, Applicant acknowledged that he wrote off \nthe children\u2019s salaries as a business expense of the company.  Tr. at 29\u201330. The record is unclear \nas to whether the children actually received any weekly stipend or whether giving them a salary \non his company\u2019s account was done for the sole purpose of writing off a business expense. \nApplicant\u2019s statement that he initially paid them a salary of $100/week is uncorroborated.  \nElsewhere in the record evidence, he stated that he gave the older child $175/week, and there is \nsome evidence, discussed further below, that he was writing off a much larger salary for each of \nthem. GE 2 at 15. \nApplicant stated that, in December 2008, he increased his children\u2019s salary from \napproximately $5,200/year paid weekly to $20,000/year, paid annually. Answer to SOR at 3. The \nchildren were about 13 and 16 at the time. It is unclear from the record whether the children \nactually received that payment or whether it was purely a faux deduction for a business expense. \nAt hearing, Applicant testified that he \u201cchanged their . . . pay scale on advice of [his] accountant.\u201d \nTr. at 30. This testimony is uncorroborated. \nThe following summer, in August 2009, Applicant\u2019s firm went out of business, having lost \nthe government contract it had held since 2003. GE 1 at 9\u201310. In addition to filing his own claim \nfor unemployment benefits, Applicant filed unemployment claims online in his children\u2019s names.  \nThe online filing system calculated benefits based on the highest wages in the previous five \nquarters, and both children initially received the state\u2019s maximum unemployment benefits, based \nupon the reported wages of $20,000 in a single quarter in late 2008. Answer to SOR at 3. Shortly \nthereafter, the state unemployment office (UEO) contacted Applicant to inquire whether the older \nchild\u2019s salary should have been entered as a quarterly payment of $5,000, as the annual salary was \n$20,000. Although Applicant declined to modify his claim, the UEO reduced the child\u2019s benefits \nto align with a salary of $5,000 per quarter, rather than $20,000 per quarter. The UEO did not \ninquire into the younger child\u2019s claim, and those unemployment benefits remained at the maximum \nlevel. Id. \nThe UEO paid unemployment benefits for both children for the maximum period of 99 \nweeks. The unemployment checks were mailed to Applicant\u2019s residence, which Applicant \ntestified was the children\u2019s \u201clegal residence.\u201d Tr. at 33\u201335. That testimony is contradicted by his \n2012 security clearance application (SCA), in which Applicant reported his children\u2019s address to \nbe the same as their mother\u2019s.

At hearing, Applicant \ntestified that he deposited the unemployment checks in his children\u2019s personal bank accounts. Tr. \nat 15, 33\u201334. Both of those uncorroborated claims are contradicted by considerable evidence, \nincluding other statements by Applicant. In his clearance interview, discussed further below, \nApplicant stated that his wife was surprised in 2013 to discover that he was collecting \nunemployment benefits in the children\u2019s name, that she reported him to state authorities, and that \nhe has had no contact with his ex-wife or children since 2013. GE 2 at 9, 11, 15. In his hearing \ntestimony, Applicant stated again that his wife was surprised to discover that he was collecting \nbenefits in the children\u2019s name and that she and the children reported him. Tr. at 15\u201319. \u201cThis \nentire case was brought against me by my ex-wife and my sons . . . because they believed that I \nwas doing something that was illegal.\u201d Tr. at 15. Moreover, the state charged him with identity \ntheft, false representation, and grand theft, charges that are inherently inconsistent with his \nrepresentation that he was giving the funds to the children. The weight of the evidence of record \nsupports a conclusion that Applicant\u2019s children did not know that he was receiving unemployment \nbenefits in their name and that his family reported him to authorities when they discovered the \nfraud. \nUnder cross-examination at hearing, Applicant steadfastly refused to acknowledge that any \nof his admitted behavior\u2014putting young children on payroll, writing off their salaries as a business \nexpense, and drawing unemployment benefits in their names\u2014was fraudulent. Instead, he \nrepeatedly asserted that he relied upon advice of unidentified accountants and UEO personnel. \nOnly at the conclusion of the hearing, after Department Counsel\u2019s closing argument, did Applicant \nwaver. He requested to go back on the record and acknowledged that he \u201cshould never have \nattempted to defraud the U.S. Government\u201d by \u201cemploying [his children] and paying them a salary \nand calling it a business deduction.\u201d Tr. at 44. He did not address the allegation in the SOR\u2014that \nhe also improperly drew state unemployment benefits in their names. \nThe Judge\u2019s brief recitation of facts and briefer analysis entirely ignored the innumerable \nsecurity concerns raised by this long, complex pattern of fraudulent conduct that culminated in the \nstate charges alleged on the SOR. For example, the Judge found as fact that Applicant employed \nhis children and paid them about $20,000/year, but neglected to mention that the children did no \nwork for the firm, which was on a government contract, and that their salaries were written off as \nbusiness expenses for seven years. Additionally, the Judge found that Applicant filed for \nunemployment benefits on behalf of his minor children, but neglected to mention that the children \nhad never been bona fide employees and were not entitled to the benefits. In omitting virtually all \ndetails of Applicant\u2019s fraudulent scheme, the Judge rendered findings of fact that are, at best, \nincomplete. \nMoreover, the Judge found as fact that Applicant, upon receipt of the unemployment \nchecks, placed them into his children\u2019s bank accounts, accepting without explanation Applicant\u2019s \nimplausible testimony on this fundamental issue. \u201cWhen the record contains conflicting evidence, \nthe Judge must carefully weigh the evidence in a reasonable, common sense manner and make \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nfindings that reflect a reasonable interpretation of the evidence that takes into account all the record \nevidence.\u201d ISCR Case No. 99-0435 at 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2000). Here, the Judge failed to \nacknowledge the conflicts, failed to weigh the evidence, and failed to make findings that took into \naccount any evidence beyond Applicant\u2019s testimony. In sum, our review of the record convinces \nus that the Judge failed to examine and consider relevant evidence.  \nFailure to Consider Important Aspects of the Case \nAdditionally, the Judge neglected to consider a critical aspect of the case\u2014Applicant\u2019s \ninconsistent statements throughout the security clearance process. We focus below specifically on \nhis inconsistent statements regarding how his unemployment fraud was discovered. \nSubject Interview: In his adopted September 2018 clearance interview, Applicant told the \ngovernment investigator the following regarding his state criminal charges and related matters. \nIn 2013, Applicant\u2019s ex-wife came to live temporarily at his home. While there, she gained \naccess to his home computer and collected personal and business information without his \nknowledge. Two years later, she provided inaccurate information to the state unemployment office \n(UEO) and coerced their children to do the same. Applicant is unaware of the specific false \ninformation his ex-wife provided. The UEO contacted Applicant, but Applicant declined to be \ninterviewed because the UEO would not provide him the questions beforehand.  GE 2 at 11. \nIn December 2015, the local district attorney\u2019s (DA\u2019s) office brought five felony charges \nagainst him, including identity theft, false representation, and grand theft. Applicant does not \nknow why the DA brought those particular five felony charges, but the DA mentioned that \nApplicant paid his children $100,000 and $175,000 while they were purportedly employed at his \ncompany. Id. at 11, 15. \nSince 2013, Applicant has had no contact with his ex-wife or his children and was unable \nto provide their address.  Id. at 9. From this chain of events, Applicant \u201clearned a valuable lesson \nand has password-protected all his personal electronic devices.\u201d Id. at 11. \nAnswer to the SOR: In December 2020, Applicant provided the following answer, in \npertinent part, to the SOR, through his attorney.  \nWhile Applicant was unemployed from 2009\u20132011, he was also involved in a \u201cdissolution\u201d \nwith his ex-wife, and \u201cit was contentious at times.\u201d3 Answer to SOR at 3. In about June 2010, his \nex-wife was at Applicant\u2019s home and saw the June 2010 unemployment check statement for their \nyounger child. Applicant\u2019s ex-wife demanded that Applicant turn over all the monies directly to \nher and threatened that she would seek to have criminal charges filed if he did not comply. \nApplicant did not give in to \u201cthis extortion\u201d because he did not believe he was doing anything \ninappropriate. Id. \n3 Applicant has been divorced since 1997.

Id. at 3\u20134. \nTestimony at Hearing: At his hearing, Applicant testified in pertinent part as follows: \nIn 2009, his company lost its contract. He filed for unemployment benefits for himself \nand, after checking with the UEO, filed for benefits for his children. All three of them collected \nbenefits from 2009 until 2011. The children\u2019s checks were sent to his residence, which was also \ntheir residence, and he would \u201ccash them in their behalf and put them into their bank accounts.\u201d \nTr. at 15.  \nIn 2010, my ex-wife discovered what I was doing and said to me, \u201cGive \nme these funds or I will turn you in to the [UEO] for doing something you shouldn\u2019t \nbe doing.\u201d So I turned and told her to go ahead and call the [UEO], which she did \nin 2010, and presented all the evidence she had at the time about me collecting or \nthe boys collecting funds that I was \u2013 I was cashing and putting into their account.  \n[Id. at 16.] \nApplicant heard nothing from the UEO. \nIn June 2011, he stopped receiving the \nunemployment checks and later discovered that his ex-wife had changed the address of the \nchildren, so that the final checks for the children went to her house. Id. at 16\u201317, 35. \nIn January of 2012, the UEO sent 1099 forms to Applicant and the children to claim the \nunemployment benefits as income, but his ex-wife did not believe that she or the children owed \nany taxes. A year later, the children received a letter from the IRS regarding the underpayment of \ntaxes. His ex-wife attempted to contact the UEO and the IRS to report that she was knew nothing \nabout these unemployment benefits, but received no response. Id. at 17. \nWhen the IRS pursued payment of income taxes on the unemployment benefits, his ex-\nwife filed another complaint with the UEO, this time in the form of a whistleblower complaint that \nApplicant had applied for unemployment on behalf of the children and stolen the money. After \nApplicant declined to meet with the UEO and that UEO\u2019s inquiry stalled, his ex-wife took the \ncomplaint to the local DA\u2019s office. The DA then filed the felony charges against Applicant. Id. \nat 17\u201318. \nInconsistencies: In reviewing Applicant\u2019s varying accounts, what is immediately apparent \nis his major shift in timeline. When first interviewed in September 2018, Applicant placed the \ndiscovery of fraud by his ex-wife in 2013, when she was staying at his home. By the time he \nanswered the SOR in December 2020, Applicant had shifted the discovery by his ex-wife back in \ntime to June 2010, which allowed him at his hearing to paint his children and ex-wife as complicit: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n[The children] did not say anything at the time even though they were well aware \nof all of this \u2013 these actions, because my ex-wife had already told them about it in \n2010. They knew all about this and took no actions. [Tr. at 32.] \nWhat happened was in 2010, she discovered that there was a \u2013 that checks were \nbeing sent and she threatened me. And then in June or maybe April, she changed \nthe address and the final three checks of \u2013 to (the children) went to her at her \naddress, which they cashed. . . . But the point what you\u2019re making there is that \nthey committed the same crime, though. They cashed the checks that apparently \nthey were not supposed to be getting.  [Id. at 35.] \nFrom the conflicting, confusing, and contradictory versions of events offered by Applicant, \nit is impossible to discern the truth even on this one issue\u2014that is, how and when was Applicant\u2019s \nfraud discovered. However, the criminal and dishonest conduct in which Applicant engaged over \nmany years raised questions about his honesty and integrity that required the Judge to engage in a \ncritical evaluation of Applicant's statements and denials. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 99-0005 at 3\u2013 \n4 (App. Bd. Apr. 19, 2000). The Judge may ultimately have been unable to resolve the \ninconsistencies. At a minimum, however, the Judge needed to acknowledge those inconsistencies \nand weigh them in assessing Applicant\u2019s candor, integrity, and reliability. \nOf note, even a brief review of the record reveals that Applicant\u2019s testimony at hearing \nabout his ex-wife\u2019s discovery of the fraud was not credible. The only SCA in the record is from \nFebruary 2012. On that SCA, Applicant lists his ex-wife as a reference on three different sections: \nin \u00a711 - Where You Have Lived as a reference for his long-term residence; in \u00a713A \u2013 Employment \nActivities as a reference for the 2009 \u2013 2011 period of unemployment in issue; and in \u00a716 \u2013 People \nWho Know You Well. GE 1 at 8, 9, 12. His February 2012 SCA clearly signals that he and his \nex-wife were on amicable terms in early 2012 and that he was confident she would be a positive \nreference when questioned by the government investigator. Moreover, in his 2018 clearance \ninterview, Applicant disclosed that he and his ex-wife entered into a financial real estate venture \ntogether in September 2012 and that she was living in his home in 2013. GE 2 at 11, 13. Taken \ntogether, this evidence effectively rebuts Applicant\u2019s hearing testimony that his ex-wife confronted \nhim in 2010 about his unemployment fraud and that she reported him the same year to state \nauthorities.  Tr. at 16. \nThe Judge erred in failing to address this critical aspect of the case\u2014Applicant\u2019s \ninconsistent statements, aspects of the record that undermine his credibility, and the resulting \nimpact on any assessment of his credibility. \nFailure to Articulate Explanation for Conclusions \nBefore concluding that Applicant had mitigated the security concerns, the Judge cited just \nthree facts: that \u201c[m]ore that ten years have passed since the Applicant\u2019s alleged felonious conduct, \nand his admitted misdemeanor conduct\u201d; that his probation was ending; and that Applicant had \nsubmitted evidence of successful work with his current employer.

Instead, his cursory reference to Applicant\u2019s \u201calleged \nfelonious conduct, and his admitted misdemeanor conduct\u201d demonstrates that the Judge failed to \nexamine the underlying conduct at issue in the SOR, but rather relied in error upon two factors: \nthe state\u2019s failure to prosecute the felonies and his credibility determination of Applicant. Id. \nFailure to Prosecute \nIn 2015, Applicant was charged with five felonies, to include charges of false \nrepresentation, identity theft, and grand theft. In 2017, he was permitted to plead instead to one \nmisdemeanor, and the felonies were dismissed. That decision by a state prosecutor should not \nhave ended the Judge\u2019s inquiry into the nature of the underlying conduct. \u201c[T]he reasons why a \nstate prosecutor and a state court decide to handle a criminal matter within their jurisdiction and \nauthority in a particular manner are logically, legally, and practically based on various \nconsiderations having little or no relevance to a security clearance adjudication.\u201d ISCR Case No. \n03-07245 at 5 (App. Bd. May 20, 2005). The Directive itself highlights that a security concern \nmay arise from \u201cevidence . . . of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the individual was \nformally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.\u201d Directive, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 31(b). Moreover, it is \nwell-established under Appeal Board precedent that a failure to prosecute is not tantamount to a \ndetermination of innocence and does not resolve the Government\u2019s security concerns about the \nunderlying conduct. \nRegardless of the dismissal of the felony charges, the evidence before the Judge was \nsufficient to constitute substantial evidence that Applicant engaged in long-term fraudulent \nbehavior by, inter alia: listing his children as employees when they were not, filing for \nunemployment benefits in his children\u2019s names to which they were not entitled, receiving those \nbenefits over a period of 99 weeks, and converting the funds to his own use. Applicant\u2019s sentence \nalone\u201460 months\u2019 probation and $45,000 restitution\u2014confirms the gravity of his underlying \nconduct. The Judge erred in failing to examine the serious criminal nature of Applicant\u2019s conduct. \nCredibility Determination \nIn his findings of fact, the Judge\u2014without explanation\u2014adopted Applicant\u2019s testimony on \nmaterial issues, without acknowledging and reconciling contradictory evidence. \nWe give \ndeference to a Judge\u2019s credibility determinations, but that deference is not unfettered. As we have \npreviously held, when the record contains a basis to question an applicant\u2019s credibility (e.g., prior \nadmissions, inconsistent statements), the Judge should address that aspect of the record explicitly, \nexplaining why he found the Applicant\u2019s version of events to be worthy of belief. \u201cFailure to do \nso suggests that a Judge has merely substituted a favorable impression of an applicant\u2019s demeanor \nfor record evidence.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-07539 at 4 (App. Bd. Oct. 18, 2018). In this regard, the \nJudge failed on at least two levels. First, he failed to discuss evidence of Applicant\u2019s lengthy \npattern of fraud that culminated in the state charges; and, second, he failed to explain why he found \nApplicant\u2019s contradictory in-hearing narrative to be more worthy of belief than other evidence of \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrecord. We are persuaded that the Judge merely substituted a favorable impression of Applicant\u2019s \ndemeanor for record evidence and allowed this favorable impression to distort his findings of fact, \nhis analysis, and his evaluation of the whole person criteria. \nConclusion \nAfter considering Department Counsel\u2019s arguments in light of the entirety of the record, \nwe conclude that the Judge failed to address important aspects of the record. Consequently, his \nfindings of fact are incomplete, conclusory, and not based upon consideration of all relevant and \nmaterial evidence. Directive \u00b6 6.3. The Judge failed to articulate an explanation for his \nconclusions and rendered a decision that runs contrary to the weight of the record evidence. His \nconclusions reflect a clear error of judgment and are so implausible that they cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. In sum, the Judge\u2019s conclusion that Applicant mitigated the \nGuideline J security concerns is arbitrary and capricious. Accordingly, the favorable security \nclearance determination cannot be sustained. \nOrder \nThe Decision of the Judge is REVERSED. \nSigned: James F. Duffy \nJames F.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPatrick J. McLain, Esq. \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nSeptember 11, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis of \nthat decision\u2014a security concern raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance \nMisuse) of DoD Directive 5220.6 (January 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested \na hearing. In July 2021, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) amended the SOR, \nadding a security concern raised under Guideline E (Personal Conduct). On May 2, 2022, after \nthe hearing, DOHA Administrative Judge Edward W. Loughran denied Applicant\u2019s request for a \nsecurity clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleged that Applicant falsified a 2013 security clearance \napplication (SCA) in that he failed to disclose ongoing marijuana use. Under Guideline H, the \nSOR alleged that Applicant used marijuana from about 1999 to about 2016; that he used marijuana \nfrom about 2013 to about 2016 while granted access to classified information; that he failed a \nurinalysis test in about 2008, testing positive for marijuana; and that he was arrested in about 2006 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nfor a drug-related incident. The Judge found adversely to Applicant on the Guideline E allegation \nthat he falsified his 2013 SCA and on the Guideline H allegation that he used marijuana from 2013 \nto 2016 after being granted access to classified information. He found favorably on the remaining \nGuideline H allegations, finding that all drug use and incidents prior to 2013 were mitigated by \nthe passage of time. \nOn appeal, Applicant argues that the Government failed to meet its burden of proof and \nthat the Judge misapplied the mitigating conditions and the whole person concept. Consistent with \nthe following, we affirm. \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact and Analysis \nApplicant is a 39-year-old employee of a defense contractor. He has worked for his current \nemployer since 2011. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2005 and two master\u2019s degrees in 2011. \nIn August 2013, Applicant submitted a SCA, in which he reported his 2006 arrest for \nsmoking a marijuana cigarette and disclosed marijuana use from about 1999 to about 2007. He \ndescribed his use as recreational and moderate and stated his intent not to use in the future. He \nintentionally failed to report the full extent of his marijuana use, as he was still periodically using \nmarijuana. In September 2013, Applicant was interviewed for his background investigation and \ngave answers consistent with his SCA, again stating that he had not used marijuana since late 2007 \nand did not intend to use in the future. Shortly thereafter, Applicant was granted a secret security \nclearance, but continued to periodically smoke marijuana through December 2016.  \nIn April 2019, Applicant completed another SCA and fully disclosed his marijuana use. \nThere is no evidence of any illegal drug use after December 2016. \nApplicant lied about his marijuana use on his 2013 SF 86, and then \ncontinued to use marijuana while holding the security clearance he obtained \nthrough those lies. His conduct continues to cast doubt on his current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, good judgment, and willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. The [Guideline H] mitigating conditions, individually or collectively, \nare insufficient to alleviate those concerns. \n. \n. \n. \nHe is credited with finally coming clean in April 2019, but that is insufficient to \novercome the lie that enabled him to obtain a security clearance. Personal conduct \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated. [Decision at 6\u20137.] \nDiscussion \nTurning first to Applicant\u2019s bare assertion that the Government failed to meet its burden of \nproof, we are not persuaded. Applicant admitted using marijuana as alleged in the SOR, including \nwhile granted access to classified information. SOR Answer at 1; Government Exhibit 2 at 62 and \n64; Tr. at 13, 28, and 32. An Applicant\u2019s admission provides an Administrative Judge with a \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nlegally sufficient basis to find that the applicant engaged in the conduct covered by the applicant\u2019s \nadmission.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-21087 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 19, 2005). \nWe turn next to Applicant\u2019s argument that the Judge failed to give appropriate weight to \nhis mitigating evidence. In particular, Applicant argues that the Judge did not properly weigh his \ncandor on his 2019 SCA. \u201cThe [Judge] determined that because Applicant was not truthful in \n2013 he should be punished for his honesty in 2019 . . . . Applicant could very easily have repeated \nhis same responses from 2013 and no one would ever have been the wiser.\u201d Appeal Brief at 5. Of \nnote, Applicants are required to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to relevant and material \nquestions needed to reach a clearance decision. As the Judge noted, Applicant's candor in his 2019 \nSCA weighs in his favor, but it is not dispositive. The fact that Applicant provided full and truthful \nanswers on his 2019 SCA does not preclude the Judge from evaluating the security significance of \nApplicant's falsification on his 2013 SCA and his post-clearance marijuana use. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 99-0519 at 14 (App. Bd. Feb. 23, 2001).  \nThe remainder of Applicant\u2019s brief is fundamentally an argument that the Judge \nmisweighed the evidence. None of Applicant\u2019s arguments, however, are enough to rebut the \npresumption that the Judge considered all of the record evidence or to demonstrate the Judge \nweighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Moreover, \nthe Judge complied with the requirements of the Directive in his whole-person analysis by \nconsidering all evidence of record in reaching her decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at \n2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, 2020). \nApplicant incorrectly notes the Judge found against him on the SOR allegation pertaining \nto a failed urinalysis test in 2008 and makes arguments regarding that allegation. We need not \naddress those arguments as the Judge found in favor on Applicant on that allegation.  \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that he should \nbe granted any relief on appeal. The Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a \nsatisfactory explanation for the decision.  The decision is sustainable on the record.  \u201cThe general \nstandard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with national security.\u2019\u201d \nDepartment of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988).

Applicant requested a hearing. \nOn August 18, 2022, after close of the record, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nAdministrative Judge Benjamin R. Dorsey denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  \nApplicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged four arrests between January 1999 and December 2017 for driving under \nthe influence.

Consistent with the \nfollowing, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact \nApplicant is in his late fifties, married, with one adult child. He served on active duty with \nthe U.S. military from 1983 until 1999 and in the Reserve force from 2000 until 2004. \nApplicant has a significant history of alcohol-related offenses. In about January 1999, he \nwas charged with driving while intoxicated (DWI) in State A. He had a .15 or higher blood alcohol \ncontent (BAC) at the time of his arrest and pleaded guilty to DWI. His sentence included a \nsuspended license, probation, a fine, and alcohol counseling. Because he did not believe that he \nhad a drinking problem, Applicant did not pursue alcohol counseling beyond that mandated by the \ncourt. \nApplicant asserted that he stopped drinking after his 1999 DWI arrest until about 2006 \nbecause of his military obligations. Nevertheless, Applicant was arrested in July 2004 in State A \nand charged with driving under the influence (DUI). According to the police report, he was initially \npulled over for speeding. The police officer reported that Applicant had trouble stabilizing his \nmotorcycle during the stop, that the officer smelled the strong odor of alcohol, and that Applicant \nhad difficulty balancing. Applicant refused the field sobriety test and a breathalyzer and was \narrested. \nApplicant claimed that he was not drinking and that he was being unfairly targeted by local \nauthorities. He pleaded not guilty, but was convicted of DUI after a jury trial. His sentence \nincluded a suspended license, fines, a short jail sentence, and supervised probation.  \nIn 2010, Applicant was involved in a single vehicle accident in State B. Seriously injured, \nhe was flown by helicopter to a nearby hospital. The police officer who responded to the scene \nnoted the presence of alcohol containers and that Applicant smelled of alcohol. The hospital \nperformed a blood draw of Applicant, with a resulting BAC of .351.  Applicant was charged with \nDUI. Applicant does not believe that he had a drinking problem at the time and did not pursue \nany alcohol counseling. Despite the seriousness of the accident and Applicant\u2019s elevated BAC, \nthe charges against him were dismissed.  \nIn late 2017, Applicant was again arrested in State B and charged with his fourth DUI after \nanother driver reported to police that Applicant\u2019s vehicle was weaving on the road. Applicant \nadmitted to having had some alcohol but denied that he was intoxicated. Applicant failed his field \nsobriety test and refused any tests to determine his BAC. A judge issued a warrant for two vials \nof blood, which revealed a BAC of .14.  Applicant was convicted of DUI and attended mandatory \ncounseling. After his 2017 conviction, Applicant admitted that he had a problem with alcohol and \nstated that he has modified his behavior by drinking less and drinking only beer. He acknowledged \nthat he continued to drink and drive between 2010 and 2017, but states that he has not done so \nsince his 2017 conviction. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis \nBetween 1999 and 2017, Applicant was excessively consuming alcohol \noften enough to be charged with an alcohol-related offense once every five or six \nyears. While it has not been five years since his last DUI, his previously established \npattern causes me to doubt that enough time has passed to show that his excessive \nalcohol consumption is unlikely to recur. This pattern also detracts from his ability \nto demonstrate a clear and established pattern of modified consumption or \nabstinence. \nWhile Applicant alleged that he has modified his alcohol consumption, he \nhas done so after earlier DUIs only to be charged again. He has completed court-\nordered alcohol counseling, but has not provided evidence of any treatment \nrecommendations. Therefore, he cannot show that his modified consumption \ncomplies with those recommendations. Accordingly, Applicant has not provided \nsufficient evidence to mitigate the alcohol consumption security concerns.  \n[Decision at 6.] \nDiscussion \nApplicant has not challenged any of the Judge\u2019s specific findings of fact. Rather, he \ncontends that the Judge erred in two regards: first, he improperly admitted evidence; and, second, \nhe failed to consider all the mitigation evidence submitted and to properly apply the whole-person \nconcept. \nApplicant contends that the Judge erred in admitting and considering Government Exhibit \n5, the police report on Applicant\u2019s 2010 arrest. Applicant contends that it \u201cshould not have been \nused as I was not charged, and the information used would not have been used in a [State B] court \nof law.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. Putting aside Applicant\u2019s failure to object at hearing, this exhibit is \nadmissible both as an official record under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20 and as a public record under Federal \nRule of Evidence 803(8). See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-02859 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 23, 2017). The \nJudge found that charges resulting from this conduct were dismissed. Such a circumstance, \nhowever, does not preclude a Judge from finding that the underlying misconduct occurred. See, \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 16-03603 at 4 (App. Bd. May 29, 2019).  \nApplicant also contends that the Judge failed to give appropriate weight to his evidence in \nmitigation. For example, Applicant cites to the fact that his most recent DUI was almost five years \nago. \u201cThis demonstrates that Applicant has taken steps to modify his behavior.\u201d Appeal Brief at \n1. Security clearance decisions, however, are not an exact science, but rather are predictive \njudgments about a person's security suitability in light of that person's past conduct and present \ncircumstances. Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528-529 (1988). The Board has \nrepeatedly declined to furnish \"bright-line\" guidance regarding the concept of recency. The extent \nto which security concerns have been mitigated through the passage of time is a question that must \nbe resolved on a case-by-case basis, based on the evidence as a whole. In this case, the Judge \nhighlighted a pattern of DUIs that occurred once every five to six years. Considering the record \nevidence, the Judge\u2019s determination that insufficient time has passed to conclude that Applicant is \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunlikely to engage in excessive alcohol consumption was not arbitrary or capricious.

Though believing Ms. C to be underage and aware that sexual communications with a \nminor is illegal, he sent her photos of his genitals, offered to teach her how to perform various \nsexual acts, and provided information to her about access to websites containing pornographic \nvideos. However, he denied fantasizing about sexual relations with minors.  Applicant asked Ms. \nC to meet with him where they could be alone, although he insisted that he did not intend to have \nsex with her.1 \nApplicant\u2019s interactions with Ms. C were discovered, and he admitted his \nmisconduct to an investigator. Applicant received non-judicial punishment under the Uniform \nCode of Military Justice and was subsequently discharged for cause from the military, as stated \nabove. These matters constitute the operative facts underlying each of the Guidelines in the SOR. \nApplicant has disclosed his misconduct to his spouse, in-laws, and employer. He has \nreceived counseling from a therapist experienced in treating pedophiles, who advised that \nApplicant does not meet the criteria for pedophilia, although she did not provide a formal \ndiagnosis. He has also received counseling from depression, anxiety, and ADHD through the VA.  \nApplicant has expressed contrition for his misconduct and has become more active in his church. \nHe provided evidence from numerous character witnesses, who attested to his honesty, \nprofessionalism, trustworthiness, and reliability. His references support his effort to obtain a \nclearance. \nThough noting that Applicant\u2019s misconduct is not recent, that he has received counseling, \nand that he has an excellent employment record, the Judge found that Applicant\u2019s claim that he \ndid not intend to commit a \u201clewd act\u201d upon Ms. C was not credible and that there is insufficient \nproof of rehabilitation. The Judge concluded that Applicant had not accepted full responsibility \nfor his security-significant conduct. \nApplicant contends that there is sufficient evidence to demonstrate rehabilitation. He \nargues that the record shows that there have been no repeat offenses; that he has admitted his \nmisconduct to investigators, employers, and family; that he is careful to follow all protocols in the \nhandling of classified information; and that he has presented evidence that he can be trusted. \nApplicant\u2019s arguments are not enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge considered all of \nthe evidence in the record or to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02872 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. \n15, 2020). Applicant requests \u201can interim clearance\u201d and would willingly submit to interviews, \nrelease of records, or other procedures that would enable him to retain access to classified \ninformation. Applicant\u2019s arguments and the record evidence do not support application of any of \nthe possible waivers to policy set forth in Directive, Encl. 2, App. C. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19\u00ad\n01084 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2020).  \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for \nthe decision. The decision is sustainable on this record.  \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance \n1 \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to do anything like that . . . I couldn\u2019t do that. That\u2019s sick, twisted, and I don\u2019t even know why I \nwent as far as I did.

Applicant requested a hearing. On February 23, 2022, after the hearing, Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Mark Harvey denied Applicant\u2019s \nrequest for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nOn appeal, Applicant contends the Judge erred in his analysis of the evidence.

Eligibility for access to classified information is \ndenied. [Decision at 1.] \nAt the court-martial, Applicant pled guilty to various charges pursuant to a pretrial \nagreement. Although he pled not guilty to a larceny charge at the court-martial, the evidence at \nhis security clearance hearing led the Judge to conclude he stole U.S. munitions. Decision at 11. \nOf note, Applicant arranged for foreign and U.S. munitions to be transported to a U.S. military \nbase and then to his home. While Applicant was away on leave, his home was burglarized, the \ndoor was left open, and a neighbor called the police who discovered the munitions in his residence. \nThe Judge noted that Applicant claimed he intended to use the munitions as aids in a military K-9 \ntraining program on base, but failed to explain how he could use it in that manner without \nincriminating himself.  Decision at 17. \nOn appeal, Applicant contends the Judge erred because he did not have \u201cthe full picture \nand detailed information[.]\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. He argues, for example, that the foreign and U.S. \nmunitions he acquired did not shortchange U.S. units rotating into theater; that the U.S. munitions \neventually would have been either destroyed or left behind in the country, possibly falling into the \nhands of terrorists; that the U.S. munitions were unaccounted for (i.e., \u201coff the property books\u201d \n(Id.)) and, given this status, questions how they could be considered stolen property; that the Judge \nerred in concluding his surreptitious shipment of the munitions on military aircraft or its storage \nat his residence put military personnel and his neighbors at risk of death or serious injury; that he \nwas never referred to court-martial for the BAH overpayments; and that the Judge erred in \nconcluding he wrongfully appropriated those overpayments. Applicant further contends the Judge \nmisapplied the Guideline J mitigating conditions, highlighting that the conduct at issue occurred \nover eight years ago as well as his performance of dangerous, combat duties and his successful \nrehabilitation. These arguments are unpersuasive. None of them are enough to rebut the \npresumption that the Judge considered all of the evidence in the record or sufficient to establish \nthat the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner that was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.  \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-04856 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Mar. 9, 2017). \nIn the decision, the Judge concluded: \n[Applicant\u2019s] story about his plan to use the stolen property for training is not \nplausible. Credibility is essential for a security clearance holder. The DOD must \nbe able to rely on the security clearance holder to report his own security violation \nor the security violation of a colleague, even when disclosure might damage \nsomeone\u2019s career.

In essence, the Judge concluded that Applicant\u2019s testimony about using the \nmunitions as training aids was not believable. Tr. at 38-42. The Judge could consider that \ndetermination in assessing whether Applicant successfully rehabilitated himself and in evaluating \nwhether he mitigated the Guideline J security concerns. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03-20327 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 26, 2006) (listing the purposes for which non-alleged conduct can be considered). \nBased on our review of the record, we find no reason to disturb the Judge\u2019s adverse conclusions. \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error.

Applicant initially requested a decision on the written record \nbut subsequently requested a hearing. On June 21, 2022, after the hearing, Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Edward W. Loughran denied Applicant\u2019s \nrequest for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nOn appeal, Applicant asserts that the Judge\u2019s decision was arbitrary, capricious, and \ncontrary to law.  Consistent with the following, we affirm.  \nJudge\u2019s Findings of Fact: The Judge\u2019s factual findings are summarized below: \nApplicant is in her early fifties, has worked for the same defense contractor since 2008, \nand seeks to retain her clearance.

She financed expenses of about $75,000 with credit cards as she was unable \nto qualify for a mortgage loan. She was initially able to keep her credit card payments current, but \nthe high balances caused some of the credit companies to raise interest rates. \nIn about 2014, Applicant sought the services of a debt settlement company, which advised \nher to stop paying on the credit cards to enable the company to negotiate settlements. Applicant \nenrolled her debts into the debt relief plan and paid $734 every two weeks. One of the creditors \ninformed Applicant that she would be sued if she did not pay their account, and the debt relief \ncompany offered no assistance. In October 2015, Applicant withdrew from the program, having \npaid a total of about $29,000 into the program. Two debts totaling about $20,000 were settled. \nAfter withdrawing from the debt relief plan, Applicant settled the debt from the company \nthat threatened to sue her, but did not pay any other debt. Instead, she stated, she put the money \nin an account to be used if she was sued by another creditor or to eventually pay the debt. \nIn 2017, applicant sought professional financial advice about paying her debts and the \noption of selling her house to do so. The advisor cautioned against selling the house. Between \n2018 to 2020, Applicant took two lengthy out-of-state assignments, during which she earned \novertime and per diem and saved about $75,000. In July 2019, Applicant submitted a security \nclearance application on which she fully disclosed her delinquent debts, accepted responsibility \nfor them, and stated her intent to pay. \nIn 2020, Applicant retained an attorney to locate her creditors, so that she could ensure she \nwas paying the correct entity.  The attorney advised Applicant that most of the debts could not be \nlegally enforced as they were beyond the state\u2019s statute of limitations (SOL). Two of the debts \nmay not have reached the SOL threshold at that time, but the attorney advised Applicant not to \npay on them and Applicant followed his advice. None of the debts alleged in the SOR have been \npaid.    \nApplicant sold the house in January 2022 for $255,000. From the proceeds, she paid about \n$43,000 toward student loans, bought a new car for about $30,000, and is holding $80,000 as a \ndown payment on a new home. Applicant called witnesses and submitted documents attesting to \nher strong moral character and her excellent job performance.  \nJudge\u2019s Analysis: The Judge\u2019s analysis is quoted below, in pertinent part: \nApplicant has a history of delinquent debts and financial problems. The \nevidence indicates that it was initially difficult for her to pay her debts, but clearly \nshe could pay the debts at some point, she just chose not to. . . . Applicant\u2019s plan \nto buy and renovate a house worked out very well for her. Not so much for most \nof the creditors that funded the renovations. . . . She paid about $29,117 into the \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndebt relief plan, settling two debts in the process, and she settled a third debt. Even \naccounting for those figures, she profited more than $150,000 on the sale of her \nhouse, and she never had to pay rent or a mortgage loan. Applicant is relying on \nthe statute of limitations and that the debts are no longer listed on her credit report. \nHowever, reliance on the statute of limitations does not constitute a good-faith \neffort to resolve debts. (internal citation omitted.)  . . . I am unable to find that she \nacted responsibly under the circumstances or that she made a good-faith effort to \npay her debts. \nHer financial issues cast doubt on her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and good judgment. \nNone of the mitigating conditions are \napplicable.  [Decision at 5\u20136.] \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant does not challenge any of the Judge\u2019s material findings. Instead, she \nchallenges his conclusions, arguing that he failed to consider an important aspect of the case and \nthat his analysis ran contrary to the weight of the evidence, rendering his decision arbitrary and \ncapricious. We disagree. \nEssentially, Applicant asserts that she acted responsibly and made good-faith efforts, in \nthat she participated in a debt relief program, withdrew when it was ineffective, worked overtime \nto save money to pay her bills, and sought out an attorney to help her locate the companies to \nwhich she owed money. When that attorney advised her instead not to contact any of the \ncompanies, she simply followed her attorney\u2019s advice. She contends that the Judge failed to \nconsider her good-faith efforts to pay the debts or to give those efforts their proper weight. \nContrary to Applicant\u2019s argument, our review of the record and the Judge\u2019s decision \nconfirms that the Judge considered all the evidence presented, including that evidence cited by \nApplicant in her appeal. The record establishes that Applicant was initially inclined to repay her \ndebts and made some efforts to do so, but that she ultimately decided to rely instead on her state\u2019s \nstatute of limitations. The Appeal Board has long recognized that debts remain relevant for \nsecurity clearance purposes even if they are no longer enforceable due to the running of the statute \nof limitations. That is, a judge may consider the underlying circumstances of these uncollectable \ndebts in evaluating whether an applicant demonstrated good judgment, trustworthiness, and \nreliability.  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 01-09691 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 27, 2003).  \nAs the Judge highlights in his decision, we have consistently held that reliance on a state\u2019s \nstatute of limitations does not constitute a good-faith effort to resolve financial difficulties and is \nof limited mitigative value. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-01208 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 26, 2016). \nOn appeal, Applicant appears to argue that her earlier efforts to address her debts (e.g., working \novertime, saving money, contacting an attorney) should be recognized as good-faith efforts that \nmitigate the debts. We note that Applicant has made no payments on debts related to her \nrenovations since 2014 or 2015 and that all eight debts alleged on the SOR remain unpaid. \nAdjudicative Guideline \u00b6 20(d) requires that the applicant \u201cinitiated and is adhering to a good-faith \neffort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts[.]\u201d We do not find persuasive the \nargument that saving money to repay her creditors and reaching out to an attorney for advice on \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nhow to do so constituted a good-faith effort, as Applicant ultimately elected to make no payments \ndespite having the means to do so. The Judge\u2019s conclusions that Applicant did not act responsibly \nunder the circumstances and that she did not make a good-faith effort to pay her debts are amply \nsupported by the record.  \nApplicant\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or her ability to argue \nfor a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the Judge weighed \nthe evidence or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. \nId. Applicant has failed to establish the Judge committed any harmful error. The Judge examined \nthe relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The decision is \nsustainable on this record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \n\u2018clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-00812 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Jul 8, 2015). \nApplicant contends the Judge improperly influenced his decision not to hire counsel. In \nemailed correspondence dated mid-January 2022, Applicant requested a 15 to 30-day continuance \nof the hearing scheduled for later that month. He noted he \u201cmay be over [his] head with how this \nprocess works[,]\u201d and asked whether he should hire counsel to represent him. He also asked \nwhether a \u201cpublic defense counsel\u201d was available. Attachment 1 to Appeal Brief. The Judge \nresponded to Applicant\u2019s email on the same day, denying his continuance request and further \nstating: \nAs I am the administrative judge, I do not offer advice regarding retaining counsel. \nThis is not a criminal matter, so there are not public defenders. Do not be \nconcerned about the procedural matters associated with the hearing. \nMost \nApplicants do not have attorneys, I understand that, and I will walk you through all \nof those matters. If you choose to hire any attorney now, you must advise me and \nDepartment Counsel immediately of the name and contact information and forward \nall correspondence to your counsel immediately. [Id.] \nDOHA personnel have no authority to provide advice to applicants concerning what rights \nthey should exercise. They should refrain from going beyond the language of the Directive and, \nif applicable, the current Prehearing Guidance in their interactions with applicants. See, e.g., ADP \nCase No. 18-00329 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 14, 2018). Judges cannot act as a surrogate advocate for \napplicants. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 98-0685 at 3 (App. Bd. May 20, 1999). DOHA personnel \nmust avoid making comments that may influence applicants in exercising their rights under the \nDirective. In this case, Applicant may have thought, based on the Judge\u2019s statements, that she \nwould assist him in presenting his case. Although the Judge apparently did not intend to influence \nApplicant in deciding whether to hire counsel, it is reasonable to conclude her statements could \nhave had that effect. Remand is warranted to correct this error. \nApplicant also contends the Judge was biased against him. \nThere is a rebuttable \npresumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party seeking to overcome that \npresumption has a heavy burden of persuasion. See, e. g., ISCR Case No. 18-02722 at 5 (App. \nBd. Jan. 30, 2020). Adverse rulings alone do not demonstrate judicial bias. Id. Based on \nreview of the record, we find nothing that would likely would lead a reasonable, disinterested \nperson to question her fairness and impartiality. Id. In her decision, however, the Judge made \nwhat amounts to an adverse credibility determination by categorizing Applicant\u2019s position on a \nkey issue as \u201cdisingenuous.\u201d Decision at 10. Having made such a determination, we conclude \nthat the best resolution is to remand this case to a different Judge. \nOn remand, the judge shall offer Applicant the opportunity to have a new hearing and shall \nissue a new decision in accordance with Directive \u00b6 E3.1.35. The Board retains no continuing \njurisdiction over a remanded decision. However, a Judge\u2019s decision issued after remand may be \nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28. and E3.1.30. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOrder \nThe Decision is REMANDED. \nSigned: James F.

Additionally, the SOR alleges that Applicant failed to file his 2017 federal tax return. \nIn responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted all allegations, with the exception of the two \nmedical accounts. He attributes the delinquencies to a period of unemployment from March to \nDecember 2017. During that same time period, he suffered unexpected losses in his real estate \nbusiness. Applicant also cited legal expenses related to his child custody dispute, as well as travel \ncosts to visit his son in another state. He claims that he began addressing his debts shortly after he \nregained employment in December 2017 and that he has now resolved all alleged debts other than \nhis child support arrearage.  \nRegarding his period of unemployment in 2017, Applicant disputes Department Counsel\u2019s \nrepresentation in the FORM that he left his position voluntarily in March 2017.  Instead, he states \nthat he was working remotely and that, when the contract ended, this arrangement was no longer \npossible.  He declined the option of moving out-of-state and left without a severance package. \nApplicant was not without income and financial resources, as he had real estate interests \nas early as 2013 and owned 16 properties. He stated that he suffered losses and that he invested \n$100,000 in an apartment complex and suffered theft of property by the management company, \nbut provided no proof. Applicant admits that initially he focused on paying the mortgages and \nother expenses on his rental properties. Applicant had consistent work as a contract employee and \nhas been employed full time since December 2017.  \nIn his answer to the FORM, Applicant stated that he began paying delinquent debts as early \nas January 2019, including a $37,581 payment to have his mortgage reinstated and a payment of \n$1,236 on another account.  He did not address his child support arrearage. \nThe SOR alleged child-support arrearage in the amount of $43,235. Applicant admitted \nthe allegation, but claimed that he was unable to provide child support from September 2017 to \nApril 2019 due to financial losses and insufficient income. He provided proof that he paid from \nFebruary 2006 until September 2019, usually in the amount of $1,000, but sometimes much less.  \nThe child custody issue is contentious, and Applicant provided a court order from 2019 that granted \nhim custody and allowed him to stop child support. In 2020, his arrearage was confirmed by court \norder to be approximately $44,200. He projects that it will be reduced to $32,000 and that he will \npay $700/month to address.  Applicant has represented that his attorney advised him to stop child \nsupport payments. \nThe SOR alleged four consumer accounts with delinquent debt totaling approximately \n$48,700. These debts included a deficiency balance on a surrendered car and debts for credit cards \nused for real estate repairs. Applicant settled and paid all four accounts between September and \nNovember 2020.  \nApplicant denied the two medical accounts alleged.

He changed some \nresponses after the FORM was issued in February 2021.\u201d Id. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis and Whole-Person Concept: The Judge\u2019s analysis is quoted, in \npertinent part, below: \nApplicant\u2019s financial issues began in 2017 when a contract ended and he \nwas unemployed for nine months. He initially stated in his SF-86 that he received \na severance package, but denied that in his response to the FORM. He presented \ninconsistent answers as to the ending of his job in 2017. This casts doubts on his \ntrustworthiness and whether he acted responsibly in addressing his delinquent \ndebts. . . . Applicant\u2019s child support arrearages remain unresolved and he is relying \non a court order that has not yet been signed. He chose to pay other delinquent \naccounts or settle others. He also stated that his attorney advised him not to pay \ndespite a court order. . . . The record does not support good-faith efforts to repay \ncreditors. He waited and decided to settle. This is a legitimate way to pay, but he \nwaited until after the security clearance process began to begin resolving his \ndelinquent debts. His child support is unresolved even though Applicant can clearly \nafford to pay the arrearages. \n.  .  . \nApplicant failed to meet his burden to mitigate the financial concerns set \nout in the SOR, despite the fact that he has settled four of the delinquent accounts \nand settled $44,276 of his delinquent debt. As of the close of the record, he owed \nchild-support arrearages of over $44,000 and was not making payments towards \nthe arrears. \n.\n.  . \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, I \nconclude that Applicant has not carried his burden. . . . He has not addressed his \nchild support arrearages. This creates great doubt on his judgment as he had a court \norder confirming his arrearages.  [Decision at 7\u20138.] \nDiscussion \nApplicant argues that the Judge failed to include and consider all the evidence and failed \nto properly apply the mitigating factors, both in regards to his outstanding child support arrears \nand in regards to his satisfaction of the other alleged debts. To the extent that Applicant is \nchallenging the Judge\u2019s findings of fact, the test on appeal is whether the Judge\u2019s findings are \nsupported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a \nconclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the record. Directive E3.1.32.1. To the extent \nthat he is challenging her conclusions, the Board must consider whether they are (1) arbitrary or \ncapricious; or (2) contrary to law.  Directive, E3.1.32.3. \nAs a preliminary matter, the Board notes that there is a rebuttable presumption that an \nAdministrative Judge considered all the record evidence unless the Judge specifically states \notherwise. A party's mere assertion to the contrary is not sufficient to raise a serious question as \nto whether an Administrative Judge considered the record evidence. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19\u00ad\n03344 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 21, 2020). \u201cRather, a party must base such a claim of error on something \nin the record that would permit a reasonable, disinterested person to fairly question whether the \nJudge considered the record evidence.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-23979 at 4, n.4 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, \n2004). \nTurning first to the issue of the child support arrearage, Applicant argues that the Judge \nfailed to consider complex and contentious circumstances, to include: that Applicant had paid child \nsupport consistently for many years; that the court authorized him to abate payments in 2016; that \nthe court in 2017 ordered payment of the abated months just as Applicant faced unemployment \nand significant losses in his real estate business; that Applicant has had custody of his child since \n2019; that the child\u2019s mother has failed to make court-ordered support payments; that the custody \nand child-support arrearage issues are still in litigation; and that his attorney has advised him not \nto make any payments on the arrearage until the matter has been fully litigated. \nOur review of the Judge\u2019s decision, however, reveals that she did include and consider \nthese matters, but determined them to be outweighed by Applicant\u2019s failure to make any payments \nafter regaining employment. The record evidence confirms those facts that the Judge relied upon: \nthat Applicant regained employment in December 2017, that his income increased significantly in \nthe years since, that he re-paid other debts, but that he failed to make child support payments while \nthe child remained in the mother\u2019s care and has failed to make any payments on the arrearage since \n2019, when he regained custody. As the Judge noted, Applicant\u2019s own evidence established that \na family court entered a judgment against him in September 2020 for $44,261 in arrears. Although \nApplicant has repeatedly stated that his attorney advised him not to pay on that arrearage, he has \nsubmitted no evidence to document this assertion. Having admitted that he was $43,235 in arrears \non child support payments, Applicant had the burden to present evidence that mitigated this \nconcern, but failed to do so.

Simply because \nthe debts were satisfied prior to adjudication of the FORM does not mean that the Judge was \nobligated to make favorable findings regarding those debts. Instead, the Judge was required to \nexamine all the circumstances surrounding the debts and their eventual satisfaction: in this case, \nrelevant factors included the timing of settlements, Applicant\u2019s robust salary for the past several \nyears, and the fact that one debt had already been reduced to judgment. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. \n03-04704 at 4 (App. Bd. Sep. 21, 2005). \nWe determine that there is relevant evidence of record to support the Judge\u2019s findings of \nfact regarding the child support arrearage and delinquent debts, in light of all the contradictory \nevidence in the record. Directive E3.1.32.1. Turning to the issue of whether the Judge properly \napplied the mitigating factors, Applicant\u2019s brief in essence argues that the Judge misweighed the \nevidence. However, a party\u2019s disagreement with the Judge\u2019s weighing of the evidence, or an \nability to argue for a different interpretation of the evidence, is not sufficient to demonstrate the \nJudge weighed the evidence incorrectly or reached conclusions in a manner that is arbitrary, \ncapricious, or contrary to law. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-03344 at 3. Applicant has not rebutted \nthe presumption that the Judge considered all the evidence in the record, nor has he established \nthat her decisions were arbitrary and capricious.  \nApplicant also challenges the Judge\u2019s findings with regard to his failure to file a federal \ntax return for 2017. Applicant belatedly filed it in February 2020, seven months prior to the SOR, \nand received a refund. Applicant correctly highlights that the Judge failed to cite or address \nMitigating Condition \u00b6 20(g), (\u201cthe individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those arrangements\u201d).  \nDirective, Encl. 2, App. A \u00b6 20(g). Applicant asserts this omission to be harmful error, as it is \n\u201cindicative of a Decision that did not comprehensively and fairly evaluate his case.\u201d Appeal Brief \nat 12. However, reading the decision in light of the record, we conclude that this error was \nharmless, as it did not likely affect the outcome of the case. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 10-01021 at \n3 (App. Bd. Nov. 18, 2011). As evident in the analysis sections excerpted above, the Judge focused \nprimarily on Applicant\u2019s failure to make any payments on his child support arrearage of $44,000 \nand focused to a lesser degree on his delinquent debts that were only recently settled and paid. The \nJudge\u2019s adverse decision rests squarely on those security concerns. Our review of the record and \ndecision convinces us that the Judge\u2019s apparent failure to consider and apply Mitigating Condition \n20(g) to the sole allegation of a failure-to-file did not likely affect her decision.  \nFinally, Applicant alleges that the Judge was biased. Applicant does not cite any particular \nexamples of bias, but instead takes issue with the general tone of the Judge\u2019s decision, her failure \nto acknowledge evidence favorable to him, and her statements regarding inconsistencies in his \nsubmissions. There is a rebuttable presumption that a Judge is impartial and unbiased, and a party \nseeking to overcome that presumption has a heavy burden of persuasion. The standard is not \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhether a party personally believes a Judge was biased, but rather whether the record of the \nproceedings below contains any indication that the Judge acted in a manner that would lead a \nreasonable person to question the Judge\u2019s fairness and impartiality. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 03\u00ad\n03974 at 6 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2006). Applicant has failed to cite specific instances that reflect \nbias, and our review of the record and decision reveals none. Applicant has failed to carry the \nheavy burden of persuasion. \nApplicant failed to establish that the Judge committed any harmful error or that he should \nbe granted any relief on appeal.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro Se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a security clearance. On \nJuly 15, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline J (Criminal Conduct) and Guideline E \n(Personal Conduct) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On September 2, 2022, after the hearing, Defense \nOffice of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Edward W. Loughran denied \nApplicant\u2019s request for a security clearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 \nand E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline J, the SOR alleged that: \u00b6 1.a.: in April 2014, Applicant was arrested and \ncharged with Kidnapping, Carrying or Use of Firearm in Commission of Felony, and Abuse of \nFamily/Household Members; that he was found guilty of Unlawful Imprisonment-Second Degree \nand Abuse of Family/Household Member; and that the conviction was overturned due to \nprosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments; \u00b6 1.b.: in August 2014, Applicant was arrested \nand charged with violating a temporary restraining order; \u00b6 1.c.: in March 2015, Applicant was \narrested and charged with Abuse of Family/Household Members; \u00b6 1.d.: in April 2015, Applicant \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \nwas arrested and charged with Abuse of Family/Household Members and Interference of \nReporting Emergency; and \u00b6 1.e.: in November 2015, Applicant was discharged from the military \nunder other than honorable conditions due to commission of a serious offense. Under Guideline \nE, \u00b6 2.a., the above incidents were cross-alleged. Additionally, the SOR alleged that: \u00b6 2.b.: in \nOctober 2015, Applicant received nonjudicial punishment for violating his command\u2019s no-contact \norder; and \u00b6 2.c.: in about 2014, Applicant emailed nude pictures of a female to other people \nwithout her permission.

He found adversely \nto Applicant on four remaining Guideline J allegations and the Guideline E allegation that cross-\nalleged them. \nOn appeal, Applicant challenges the Judge\u2019s determination that he committed any of the \noffenses for which he was arrested. Consistent with the following, we affirm. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact: The Judge\u2019s findings of fact are summarized below, in \npertinent part. \nApplicant is 40 years old. Divorced in 2012, he married his current wife in 2019. Applicant \nserved on active duty from 2000 until he was discharged in 2016 for misconduct due to commission \nof a serious offense. That discharge, as well as the other allegations in the SOR, arose \u201cfrom a \ntumultuous relationship with an ex-girlfriend (Ms. X).\u201d  Decision at 2. \nIn April 2014, Applicant and Ms. X lived together in an apartment, and Ms. X\u2019s sister was \nstaying with the couple. That month, Ms. X called the police to report that Applicant had just \nassaulted her, to include pushing her down, dragging her by her legs, throwing items at her, and \npointing a handgun at her head. In the sister\u2019s statement to police, she corroborated some of the \ndetails Ms. X provided and generally corroborated that Ms. X was frightened as they fled the \napartment and told her that Applicant had held a weapon to her head. The sister had seen the \nhandgun in the apartment that morning, but she was outside the apartment when the weapon \nincident allegedly occurred. Ms. X and her sister went to a friend\u2019s house, where Ms. X shared \nsome of the details about the morning\u2019s altercation with the friend. Both the sister and friend made \nstatements to the police. \nPolice searched the apartment and found an unregistered semi-automatic pistol in the \nnightstand drawer, as well as a magazine with nine rounds of ammunition. The police took pictures \nof what they described as bruises or abrasions on Ms. X\u2019s right calf and knee. Applicant was \narrested and charged with kidnapping, carrying/use of a firearm in commission of a felony, and \nabuse of family/household members. He was also issued a restraining order prohibiting him from \ncontacting Ms. X. \nIn early March 2015, Ms. X was at the prosecutor\u2019s office, preparing for the trial on the \nearlier charges, when a member of the prosecution team noticed bruising on her arms and legs. \nUpon questioning by police, Ms. X related that she was in a relationship with Applicant, that she \nwas at Applicant\u2019s apartment the prior day, that an argument turned physical, and that Applicant \npushed her and punched her in the thigh. The police officer reported bruises on Ms. X\u2019s arms and \nlegs.

She testified that she and Applicant had been in contact on \nmultiple occasions in an attempt to work things out in their relationship and that they talked about \nher upcoming testimony, but she could not remember the specifics. She testified that they were \nno longer in a relationship but that she still loved him and wanted what was best for him. Her \nsister\u2019s testimony was largely consistent with her statements to the police, although she too \ntestified in a manner somewhat more favorable to Applicant. \nIn March 2015, Applicant was convicted of the lesser offense of unlawful imprisonment-\nsecond degree and abuse of family/household member and found not guilty of the firearm offense. \nSentencing was set for May 2015. \nIn April 2015, Ms. X called the police from a location near Applicant\u2019s apartment. She \ntold the police that Applicant was her boyfriend, that they had lived together for the past five \nmonths, that he pushed her, threw her phone in the toilet, and punched her in the face.  The police \ntook photos of her injuries, which included abrasions on her face and a severely swollen eye.  \nApplicant was arrested for abusing a family member, criminal property damage, and interference \nwith reporting of an emergency. \nIn May 2015, Applicant was sentenced for the April 2014 charges.  His sentence included \nprobation for two years, with imprisonment for seven days. In September 2015, Applicant was \nfound not guilty of the April 2015 charges. In October 2015, the March 2015 charges were \ndismissed.  \nIn May 2018, the convictions for the April 2014 incident were overturned on appeal based \non improper closing argument by the prosecutor, in which he suggested that Applicant\u2019s attorney \nattempted to induce Ms. X to give false testimony. The April 2014 charges were eventually \ndismissed without re-trial.   \nIn March 2015, Applicant was issued a military protective order (MPO) by his commander \nto not initiate any contact with Ms. X and to not come within 500 feet of her. In October 2015, he \nreceived nonjudicial punishment under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice for \nviolating the order on multiple occasions from March to April 2015 by coming within 500 feet of \nMs. X and by contacting her. Applicant stated that he accepted the nonjudicial punishment and an \nother than honorable discharge to avoid court-martial.   \nApplicant denied that he ever assaulted Ms. X. He stated that their relationship was already \nover in April 2014, that she attacked him, and that he only grabbed her arms to protect himself. \nHe admitted that he had an unregistered firearm but denied that he picked it up that day. He denied \nany further romantic involvement with Ms. X after the April 2014 incidents. He testified that Ms. \nX essentially stalked him over the next year. He submitted a muster report showing he was on \nduty on the day in March 2015 on which she alleged that he assaulted her.  \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRegarding the April 2015 allegation, Applicant asserted that Ms. X came to the apartment \nto retrieve personal items, somehow forced her way in, and attacked him. He testified that he \nshowed the police everything but that they would not take a report from him. The police report \nindicates that Applicant was advised of his right to remain silent and elected to exercise it. \u201cI did \nnot find his testimony credible.\u201d  Decision at 5.  \nExcept for the incidents involving Ms. X, Applicant had an excellent military career. \nSeveral military members believe that he was set up by Ms. X and treated unfairly by the \ncommand.  In Security Access Eligibility Reports submitted by his command following the April \n2014 and April 2015 incidents, the command reported favorably on his character, stability, and \nperformance.  \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis: The Judge\u2019s analysis is quoted below in pertinent part: \nApplicant denied that he ever assaulted Ms. X. In some instances, two or \nmore witnesses can provide completely opposite descriptions of the same event, \nbut none of the witnesses are lying. That is not the case here. Either Applicant or \nMs. X lied about what happened in April 2014, March 2015, and April 2015. \nHowever, in order to accept Applicant\u2019s version of the 2014 incident, I have to \nbelieve that not only did Ms. X lie, but her sister either also lied or was lied to by \nMs. X. I would also have to find that their friend also lied or was lied to by Ms. X \nand possibly her sister. Additionally, the physical evidence, including photos of \nMs. X\u2019s injuries, supports her version. I find by substantial evidence that Applicant \ncommitted the criminal conduct alleged by Ms. X. (internal footnote omitted) \n. \n. \n. \nAll of the criminal conduct in one way or another involved Ms. X. . . . Any \ninvolvement with Ms. X appears to be in the past. The most recent criminal conduct \nhappened more than seven years ago. There are no bright-line rules for when \nconduct is considered recent. As discussed above, I have found that Applicant has \nbeen untruthful about the criminal charges throughout the security clearance \nprocess. Without complete candor, I am unable to determine that criminal conduct \nis unlikely to recur. . . . I find that criminal conduct security concerns remain \ndespite the present of some mitigation.  \n. \n. \n. \nThe analysis under Guideline J applies equally [to Guideline E]. Personal \nconduct security concerns are not mitigated. [Decision at 8\u201310.] \nDiscussion \nOn appeal, Applicant restates in detail his version of what happened during the incidents \nin April 2014, March 2015, and April 2015. He asserts that Ms. X stalked him, instigated the \nphysical altercations, and falsified allegations against him. Applicant denies that he assaulted Ms. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nX on any occasion and argues that the Judge failed to consider all the evidence prior to concluding \nthat Applicant lied about assaults.  We are not persuaded. \nAt hearing, Applicant testified at length about his relationship with Ms. X and the three \nalleged assaults in issue, presenting to the Judge essentially the same narrative recited on appeal. \nThe Judge had the opportunity to observe Applicant\u2019s demeanor during his hearing testimony, \nassess the credibility of Applicant\u2019s testimony on the matter, and weigh Applicant\u2019s denials of \nwrongdoing in light of the record evidence as a whole. He concluded that Applicant was untruthful \nregarding the criminal conduct at the core of this case. The Directive requires the Appeal Board \nto give deference to a Judge\u2019s credibility determinations. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. Moreover, the \nJudge was well within his authority to consider that determination in assessing whether Applicant \nsuccessfully rehabilitated himself and in evaluating whether he mitigated the Guideline J and \nGuideline E security concerns. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 20-01577 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 6, 2022).  \nWhen an applicant is unwilling or unable to accept responsibility for his own actions, such a failure \nis evidence that detracts from a finding of reform and rehabilitation. See, e.g., ISCR Case 21-00321 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Sep. 8, 2022). \nAlthough Applicant argues that the Judge did not consider all the evidence, he points to no \nspecific evidence that the Judge failed to address in his decision. There is a rebuttable presumption \nthat the Judge considered all the record evidence unless the Judge specifically states otherwise, \nand Applicant\u2019s bare assertion that the Judge did not consider evidence is not sufficient to rebut \nthat presumption. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-03344 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 21, 2020). Upon our \nreview, the Judge\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence of record, that is, \u201csuch relevant \nevidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the \ncontrary evidence in the same record.\u201d  Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1.  \nApplicant also contends that the Judge erred in considering the statement made by Ms. X\u2019s \nfriend, as it \u201cis hearsay and should not be considered.\u201d  Appeal Brief at 1.  The friend\u2019s statement \nis contained in Government Exhibit 4, a police report that was admitted without objection by \nApplicant. Putting aside Applicant\u2019s failure to object at hearing, this exhibit is admissible both as \nan official record under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.20 and as a public record under Federal Rule of Evidence \n803(8).  See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-02859 at 3 (App. Bd. Jun. 23, 2017). \nApplicant alleges that the Judge erred in finding that he has no college degree, stating that \nhe has earned an associate\u2019s, a bachelor\u2019s and a master\u2019s degree since 2017. The Judge\u2019s finding \nreflects the educational information in Applicant\u2019s 2016 security clearance application, which was \nneither inquired into nor updated at hearing. Any error is harmless as it likely had no effect on the \nJudge\u2019s decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020). \nApplicant requests reconsideration of his case. The Directive does not empower the Board \nto weigh the record evidence de novo and make its own findings and conclusions about the case. \nRather, the Board addresses the material issues raised by the parties to determine whether the Judge \nhas made factual or legal error. Applicant has failed to establish that the Judge committed any \nharmful error or that he should be granted any relief on appeal. The Judge examined the relevant \nevidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the decision. The decision is sustainable on \nthe record. \u201cThe general standard is that a clearance may be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent \n5 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwith national security.\u2019\u201d Department of the Navy v.

On February 1, 2022, Defense Office of \nHearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Robert Robinson Gales denied Applicant\u2019s \nrequest for a security clearance. Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nUnder Guideline G, the SOR alleged four alcohol concerns.  Under Guideline H, the SOR \nalleged two drug concerns, including long-term marijuana use and drug use while holding a \nsecurity clearance. Under Guideline F, the SOR alleged two delinquent debts to the same credit \nunion, totaling approximately $13,000. Under Guideline E, the SOR cross-alleged all those \nbehaviors, but also alleged four falsifications, to include falsifications on his security clearance \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \napplication, on his response to interrogatories, and to a licensed psychologist, all having to do with \nApplicant\u2019s alcohol and drug use history.  The Judge found against Applicant on all allegations.  \nOn appeal, Applicant represents that he mailed evidence to the Judge on November 29, \n2021, regarding the Guideline F allegations. However, the record establishes that Applicant \nreceived the Government\u2019s file of relevant material (FORM) on September 2, 2021, that he was \nadvised to submit any response within 30 days of receipt, that he timely submitted a one-page \nletter, that the record was closed on October 2, 2021, and that the case was forwarded to the Judge \nfor decision on December 13, 2021. The record contains no indication that Applicant requested \nan extension of the 30-day deadline. Applicant has not made a prima facie showing that he \nrequested an extension of time, that his request was approved, and that he subsequently submitted \nany documents within the new deadline. A review of the entire record discloses no basis to \nconclude that Applicant was denied the rights due him under the Directive. See, e.g., ISCR Case \nNo. 16-01237 at 2 (App. Bd. Dec. 5, 2017). \nMoreover, our review of the record confirms that, had the Judge received and considered \nthe mailed documents, it would likely have had no impact on his decision. Assuming arguendo \nthat the documents resolved the Guideline F concerns, the record evidence is more than sufficient \nto support the Judge\u2019s denial based on the remaining allegations under Guidelines G, H, and E. \nApplicant\u2019s appeal brief makes no other assertion of harmful error on the part of the Judge.  \nApplicant has failed to meet his burden of demonstrating an error that likely impacted the outcome \nof the case. \nThe Judge examined the relevant evidence and articulated a satisfactory explanation for \nthe decision.

On \nOctober 30, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for \nthat decision\u2014security concerns raised under Guideline I (Psychological Conditions) of \nDepartment of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant \nrequested a hearing. On August 22, 2022, after close of the record, Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Mark Harvey denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security \nclearance.  Applicant appealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nThe SOR alleged two security concerns: diagnoses in 2011 of Bipolar I Disorder (mixed \ntype), Attention-Deficient/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Generalized Anxiety Disorder, and \nObsessive Compulsive Personality (OCP) traits; and diagnoses in 2020 of Bipolar II Disorder, \nDepressive Disorder (moderate, recurrent, in partial remission), Generalized Anxiety Disorder, \nand OCP traits. In responding to the SOR, Applicant admitted both sets of diagnoses and provided \nmitigating information.  \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn motion of the Government, the Judge took administrative notice of the Diagnostic and \nStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th Edition (DSM-5) sections on Bipolar I Disorder, Bipolar \nII Disorder, and Major Depressive Disorder. He found adversely to Applicant on both allegations. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: whether Applicant was denied due \nprocess; whether the Judge failed to consider all the evidence; whether he misstated the medical \nfacts and diagnoses; and whether he failed to apply the mitigation standards correctly. For the \nreasons below, we remand. \nThe Judge\u2019s Findings of Fact \nApplicant is in his mid-forties and married, with no children. He served in the military \nfrom 1996 to 2005 and was honorably discharged. Since that time, Applicant has worked for DoD \ncontractors.  He has held a security clearance since 1997, with no evidence of security violations.  \nIn 2004, Applicant experienced the loss of his grandfather and friends. Additionally, he \nwas coping with physical problems and relationship issues. In 2005, he sought help from a general \npractitioner, was diagnosed with depression and Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), and was \nprescribed an anti-depressant. Applicant experienced significant side effects, and a physician \nadvised Applicant to stop taking the medication.  \nIn 2006, Applicant again sought medical help, first from another general practitioner and \nsubsequently from a psychiatrist (Dr. D), who diagnosed him with a Bipolar Disorder. Applicant \ndescribed episodes of mania, to include sleeping only three hours over a four-day period.  He was \nplaced on mood stabilizers and Ritalin. Applicant believed that his mania originated from his \nreaction to Ritalin, which made him feel \u201clike Superman\u201d and unable to sleep. Decision at 3, citing \nTr. at 131. Dr. D described Applicant as honest, candid, and reliable and stated that Applicant \ndoes not have a condition or treatment that could impair his judgment or reliability. After Dr. D\u2019s \nretirement in 2008, Applicant saw Dr. E for about nine months, but the record does not include Dr. \nE\u2019s diagnosis. \nFrom 2009 to 2010, Dr. F treated applicant and prescribed Lamictal for Applicant\u2019s Bipolar \nDisorder. Applicant asserted that Dr. F told him that he was unsure of the Bipolar Disorder \ndiagnosis. Nevertheless, Applicant stayed on the course of medication and complied with \ntreatment recommendations. In late 2010, Applicant moved to a different state and stopped seeing \nDr. F.  \nFrom April 2011 to October 2016, Dr. M, a psychiatrist, treated Applicant. Based on \nApplicant\u2019s mental health history upon presentation, Dr. M diagnosed Applicant with Bipolar I \nDisorder (mixed type) in remission, ADD (sic), Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Major Depression \nin remission, and OCP traits. Dr. M prescribed Lamictal for mood stabilization as well as an \nADHD medication. \nIn July 2013, Dr. M changed his diagnosis to Major Depression in remission, ADHD, and \nOCP traits, and he reduced the Lamictal prescription. Dr. M noted Applicant\u2019s judgment was \nlogical and his mood was stable. During Applicant\u2019s background investigation, Dr. M advised the \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ngovernment investigator he was not confident about the Bipolar Disorder diagnosis and the correct \ndiagnosis might be Anxiety, Depression, ADD, and OCP traits. \nApplicant followed all prescribed or recommended treatment from April 2011 to October \n2014 and from October 2014 to February 2016 (sic). His last treatment with Dr. M was in October \n2016. Applicant did not receive any treatment from October 2014 to February 2016, and Dr. M \ndid not remember why Applicant stopped treatment during that timeframe. Dr. M believed \nApplicant would carefully safeguard classified information because he is a perfectionist, anxious, \nand has OCD. \nAlthough the medical records in some instances said to see Dr. M every few weeks, \nApplicant said that Dr. M told Applicant to see him when needed or to renew a prescription. Dr. \nM never told him to stop taking Lamictal. In 2017, Applicant saw Dr. M\u2019s spouse because Dr. M \nwas out of the office. He did not provide the dates when he saw Dr. M\u2019s spouse. \nIn November 2017, Applicant went to Europe, forgot his medications, and discovered he \nfelt better without his medications. Applicant believes he can maintain stable mental health \nthrough a low carbohydrate diet and exercise. On the five or six times when he has cheated on his \ndiet, his symptoms of tiredness and lethargy have returned. \nThe DoD Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) asked Dr. B, a licensed clinical \npsychologist, to evaluate Applicant for continued access to classified information. In April 2020, \nDr. B submitted a psychological report to the DOD CAF in which she considered Applicant\u2019s \nbackground information, her clinical interview and observations of Applicant, and Applicant\u2019s \nPersonality Assessment Inventory (PAI). Dr. B diagnosed Applicant with Bipolar II Disorder, \nDepressive Disorder (moderate, recurrent, in partial remission), Generalized Anxiety Disorder, \nand OCP traits. Dr. B explained her diagnoses as follows: \nApplicant\u2019s presentation was inconsistent with his psychological test results, as he \ncertainly is quite anxious, ruminative, and possibly hypomanic at this time. His \ninsight is clearly lacking and his fixation on \u201cblood sugar issues\u201d and diet as \nopposed to voicing awareness of his psychiatric diagnoses is concerning. He \ndescribes a history of at least one hypomanic episode that he claims was the result \nof taking Ritalin as prescribed, although that is highly unlikely. He also describes \nnumerous episodes of depression. Therefore, I find that the prior diagnosis of \nbipolar disorder is appropriate. It does not seem plausible that he has ADHD in my \nopinion, as he does not describe his attention as being problematic until adulthood. \nI suspect his attentional issues are related to his other psychiatric conditions. \n[Decision at 6, quoting GE 2 at 5\u20136.] \nDr. B opined that Applicant\u2019s prognosis was \u201cpoor, based on his limited insight and the absence \nof ongoing care for psychiatric conditions.\u201d Id. \nApplicant sought an assessment from Dr. S, a licensed clinical social worker with a Ph.D. \nin psychology. Dr. S saw Applicant regularly since December 2020 and concluded that that \nApplicant does not meet the criteria for Bipolar Disorder. Dr. S did not review Applicant\u2019s past \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 2020 t\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmedical records and was unaware that Applicant experienced symptoms of Bipolar and Major \nDepressive Disorder for several years. \nDr. S based his diagnosis of \u201calmost perfectionistic\u201d on \nhis interview of Applicant, his spouse, and his coworkers. Decision at 7, citing Tr. at 33, 36. \nApplicant has not taken any medications for his mental health since November 2017. He \ndoes not believe that he has a chronic mental illness or that he requires psychiatric care. He decided \nnot to return to see Dr. M in 2017 after consulting with his spouse who does not have any training \nin psychology. If problems develop, he would seek help from a mental-health practitioner and is \nwilling to see a provider if it will satisfy security requirements. \nApplicant relied upon his facility security officer (FSO) for advice on security matters and \nsaid security officials told him the security issue was the Bipolar diagnosis. Consequently, \nApplicant believed his security issue was resolved when Dr. M changed his diagnosis from Bipolar \nto Depression. He told his FSO when the issue of his mental health first arose and when he stopped \nfollowing treatment recommendations and taking his medications. The FSO did not recommend \nwhether he should follow medical advice or tell him that he needed to communicate with his \ntreatment provider about not taking his medications.  \nWhen Applicant received the SOR, he did not know what to do. Supervisors suggested he \nseek an opinion from a third party, so he sought assistance from Dr. S and provided his medical \nrecords. Applicant presented three character witnesses at his hearing and 16 written statements \nfrom his coworkers, friends, pastor, and wife. The general sense of their statements is that \nApplicant is friendly, reliable, diligent, professional, responsible, detail oriented, and trustworthy. \nThe Judge\u2019s Analysis \nThe record establishes Adjudicative Guideline (AG) \u00b6\u00b6 28(b) and  28(d).1 \nTurning to the mitigating conditions, there is no evidence that Applicant engaged in any \nproblematic behavior or was hospitalized for a mental-health issue. \u201cHe followed all prescribed or \nrecommended treatment from April 2011 to October 2014, from October 2014 to February 2016 \n(sic), and from January\no present.\u201d Decision at 11. However, AG \u00b6\u00b6 29(b) and 29(c)2 do \nnot fully apply. There is no evidence Dr. S was acceptable to and approved by the U.S. \nGovernment, and he did not establish he is \u201ca duly qualified mental health professional\u201d as \nrequired. \n1 AG \u00b6 28(b): an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the individual has a condition that may \nimpair judgment, stability, reliability, or trustworthiness; AG \u00b6 28(d): failure to follow a prescribed treatment plan \nrelated to a diagnosed psychological/psychiatric condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness, including, but not limited to, failure to take prescribed medication or failure to attend required \ncounseling sessions. \n2 AG \u00b6 29(b): the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program . . . with a favorable prognosis \nby a duly qualified mental health professional; AG \u00b6 29(c): recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health \nprofessional employed by, or acceptable to and approved by, the U.S. Government that an individual\u2019s previous \ncondition is under control or in remission, and has a low probability of recurrence or exacerbation. \n4 \n\n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAfter a careful review of the evidence, I believe Dr. M\u2019s initial diagnosis \nand Dr. B\u2019s diagnosis and prognosis are the most accurate and reliable diagnoses \nand prognosis. The record documents a history of multiple depressive episodes and \nat least one manic episode. Dr. S\u2019s diagnosis of \u201calmost perfectionistic\u201d and the \nresulting prognosis are unreliable because he did not review Applicant\u2019s mental-\nhealth records, consult with previous treatment providers, or perform psychological \ntesting. . . . \nApplicant did not go to any appointments with Dr. M from October 24, 2014, to \nMarch 30, 2016, and from 2017 to December 2020. He did not seek mental-health \ntreatment advice before stopping his use of Lamictal. In December 2020, he started \nseeing Dr. S, who supported his notion that his mental-health problems related to \ndiet, and he did not have bipolar disorder or any other serious mental health \ndisorder. [Decision at 15.] \nDiscussion \nIn deciding whether the Judge's rulings or conclusions are erroneous, we will review the \ndecision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to articulate a \nsatisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between the facts \nfound and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error of \njudgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02563 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, \n2015). \nOn appeal, Applicant raises the issue of due process and argues that the Judge failed to \nconsider all the record evidence and misstated the medical facts and diagnoses. The essence of \nApplicant\u2019s argument is this: (1) the Judge gave undue weight to the psychological report of Dr. \nB, which was contradicted by more persuasive evidence of record; and (2) Applicant was \nmisdiagnosed with Bipolar Disorder, instead of depression, and acted responsibly in managing his \ndepression. \nFailure to Follow Treatment Recommendations \nThe Judge concluded the evidence established AG \u00b6 28(d)\u2014that Applicant failed to follow \na prescribed treatment plan. Decision at 10. The Judge relies significantly on that conclusion in \nrendering this unfavorable clearance decision. In his mitigation analysis, for example, the Judge \ncites to the facts that \u201cApplicant did not go to any appointments with Dr. M from October 24, \n2014, to March 30, 2016, and from 2017 to December 2020.\u201d Id. at 15. In his whole-person \nanalysis, the Judge states: \u201cApplicant received mental-health counseling and was prescribed drugs \nto stabilize his mood from 2005 to 2017. In 2017, he unilaterally decided that he would stop taking \nprescribed medications and he would stop attending appointments with Dr. M. He did not \ncommunicate about these decisions with Dr. M.\u201d Id. at 16. Based on our review of the Judge\u2019s \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3 \ndecision, we conclude that his reliance on AG \u00b6 28(d) violated Applicant\u2019s due process rights \nunder the Directive.  Two related aspects of this issue merit discussion. \nFirst, the SOR did not allege that Applicant failed to follow a prescribed treatment plan. \nDirective \u00b6 4.3.1 provides that a final unfavorable clearance decision shall not be made without \nfirst providing the applicant with \u201c[n]otice of the specific reasons for the proposed action.\u201d In this \nregard, the Appeal Board has previously stated, when a Judge bases an unfavorable clearance \ndecision on non-alleged conduct or matters, an applicant is denied due process. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 12-11375 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 17, 2016). Given the Judge\u2019s focus on Applicant\u2019s \nnoncompliance with a treatment plan, we conclude that the SOR did not provide Applicant \nadequate notice that he needed to be prepared to address that specific issue. \nSecond, the Judge\u2019s analysis of Applicant\u2019s purported failure to follow the treatment plan \nfocused on a non-alleged mental health condition. In his analysis, the Judge noted, \u201cApplicant did \nnot go to any appointments with Dr. M from October 24, 2014 to March 30, 2016 and from 2017 \nto December 2020.\u201d Decision at 15. During that entire period, Applicant was only diagnosed with \nMajor Depression in Remission, ADHD, and OCP traits.3 Regarding Applicant\u2019s purported \nnoncompliance with the treatment plan, it appears that Applicant\u2019s depression was the main mental \nhealth condition of concern even though it was in remission. At the hearing, Applicant was \nquestioned extensively about his depression. Additionally, the Judge took administrative notice \nof Major Depression Disorder, quoting at length provisions from DSM-5 regarding that disorder. \nRegarding this issue, it merits noting that SOR \u00b6 1.a is the only allegation upon which the issue of \nnoncompliance with the treatment plan could be based,4 and that allegation does not allege that \nApplicant was diagnosed with any form of depression. Again, Applicant had no notice that the \nJudge would focus on his non-alleged depression diagnosis in relation to his non-alleged failure to \nfollow a prescribed treatment plan.  \nIn short, because Applicant was not given adequate notice of some specific reasons upon \nwhich his unfavorable decision would be based, he was denied the due process afforded him under \nthe Directive. \nOf note, on the day that Applicant completed his security clearance application (SCA), the Director of National \nIntelligence (DNI) issued a memorandum revising the pertinent SCA mental health questions. See DNI Memorandum \non Revisions to the Psychological and Emotional Health Questions on the Standard Form 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, dated November 16, 2016. Under this revision, the pertinent question requires applicants \nto disclose only if they ever have been diagnosed with Psychotic Disorder, Schizophrenia, Schizoaffective Disorder, \nDelusional Disorder, Bipolar Disorder, Borderline Personality Disorder, or Antisocial Personality Disorder. \nInterestingly, had Applicant completed the revised SCA, he would have been required to disclose his former diagnosis \nof Bipolar Disorder but not his most recent diagnoses of Major Depression, ADHD, or OCP traits. Moreover, in the \nrevised SCA, a failure to follow a treatment plan for depression is not required to be reported. \n4 The other SOR allegation (SOR \u00b6 1.b) pertains to Dr. B\u2019s diagnosis and does not involve any treatment plan. In \nconducting a DoD-requested psychological examination, Dr. B is not a \u201ctreating\u201d mental health care professional and \nprescribed no treatment plan. Additionally, Applicant first became aware of Dr. B\u2019s diagnosis when he received the \nSOR. SOR Response. Said differently, Dr. B\u2019s diagnosis of Depressive Disorder (moderate, recurrent, in partial \nremission) cannot serve as a basis for claiming Applicant failed to follow a treatment plan. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDr. B\u2019s Report and Dr. M\u2019s Initial Diagnosis \nAs Applicant contends, the Judge relied heavily on Dr. B\u2019s report in arriving at his adverse \ndetermination under AG \u00b6 28(b). In his whole-person analysis, the Judge concludes that \u201cDr. B\u2019s \ndiagnosis and prognosis are given greater weight than the other diagnoses and prognoses of \nrecord.\u201d Decision at 16. In his Guideline I analysis, the Judge concludes that \u201cDr. M\u2019s initial \ndiagnosis and Dr. B\u2019s diagnosis and prognosis are the most accurate and reliable diagnoses and \nprognosis.\u201d Id. at 15 (emphasis added). Applicant persuasively argues the Judge failed to \narticulate a satisfactory explanation for these conclusions. \nApplicant testified that his psychological evaluation with Dr. B initially started as a Zoom \nvideo call, but \u201cwhen we first started we were having technical difficulties\u201d and conducted the \ninterview over the \u201cregular phone\u201d for an hour. Tr. at 101. Regarding Dr. B\u2019s report, the Judge \nfound that \u201cDr. B provided a detailed mental-health history of Applicant.\u201d Decision at 6. \nHowever, a review of Dr. B\u2019s report confirms Applicant\u2019s assertion that Dr. B \u201cfailed to see\u201d or \n\u201cmissed\u201d the medical records from Applicant\u2019s five years of treatment with Dr. M. Appeal Brief \nat 1 and 9. In her \u201cdetailed\u201d summary of Applicant\u2019s mental health history, Dr. B refers only one \ntime to Dr. M. That reference is to the investigator\u2019s interview of Dr. M, conducted in February \n2019. She makes no reference to the psychiatrist\u2019s medical records over the course of five years, \nwhich include the following critical details regarding Applicant\u2019s mental health: \n1. Although Dr. M initially diagnosed Applicant with, inter alia, Bipolar Disorder I, mixed \ntype, in April 2011, he promptly changed his diagnosis the following month to \u201cBipolar Disorder \nI, mixed type, in Remission.\u201d \n2. In June 2012, Dr. M removed Applicant\u2019s diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder. \n3. In July 2013, Dr. M affirmatively changed the diagnosis of Bipolar Disorder I in \nRemission to Major Depression in Remission. That change in diagnosis required the psychiatrist \nto determine that \u201c[t]here has never been a manic episode or a hypomanic episode.\u201d DSM-5 at \n160-161. \n4. This affirmative change in diagnosis was made by a psychiatrist after twenty-seven \nmonths of continuous, regular treatment of Applicant. \n5. In January 2014, Dr. M reduced Applicant\u2019s daily dosage of mood-stabilizing \nmedications to a third of his initial dosage. \n6. Through October 2016, the last in-person session with Dr. M of record, Dr. M \nmaintained his diagnosis of Major Depression in Remission. Through November 2017, when \nApplicant departed for Europe, he remained on the reduced medication regimen prescribed by Dr. \nM. \nBecause Dr. B omitted any discussion of Dr. M\u2019s medical records and the change in \ndiagnosis, she never addressed (1) why her diagnosis differed so dramatically from his; and (2) \nhow she was better positioned to diagnose Applicant following a one-hour phone interview in \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncomparison to Dr. M\u2019s in-person sessions with Applicant over five years. Dr. B\u2019s omission of the \ntreating psychiatrist\u2019s medical records calls into question the validity and value of her report.  \nAdditionally, as Applicant argues, Dr. B\u2019s interpretation of the PAI she administered \ndetracts from the validity of her report. Applicant\u2019s PAI revealed an \u201cunremarkable\u201d clinical \nprofile, \u201cwith no clinical scale elevations whatsoever,\u201d an apparently favorable result. GE 2 at 5. \nDr. B however interpreted this result negatively, opining that it demonstrated Applicant \u201clacks \ninsight into his thoughts behaviors (sic).\u201d She then cited to this \u201climited insight\u201d in concluding \nthat Applicant had a poor prognosis. GE 2 at 5 and 6. Applicant persuasively contends that \n\u201c[w]ithout any observation, evidence or articulated facts, Dr. B concluded that [Applicant] was in \ndenial as to his condition.\u201d Appeal Brief at 2. We agree that Dr. B\u2019s conclusion that a positive \nPAI test result should be considered a negative result is perplexing, particularly in light of the fact \nthat two psychiatrist (Dr. D and Dr. M) who treated Applicant over a number of years previously \nconcluded his mental health conditions did not raise concerns about his reliability.  \nSimilarly, without adequate explanation, the Judge concludes that Dr. M\u2019s initial diagnosis \nof April 2011 of Bipolar I, mixed type, is more \u201caccurate and reliable\u201d than that same physician\u2019s \nlater, corrected diagnosis of Major Depression, in Remission. Decision at 15. This conclusion by \nthe Judge is also puzzling. Dr. M\u2019s diagnosis of April 2011 was made during Applicant\u2019s intake \ninterview. Just one month later, Dr. M changed the diagnosis to \u201cIn Remission.\u201d After 27 months \nof treatment, Dr. M changed the diagnosis to Major Depression in Remission. The Judge fails to \nexplain his conclusion that a diagnosis that Dr. M made during an initial session is more \u201caccurate \nand reliable\u201d than a diagnosis by the same psychiatrist made after 27 months of sessions and that \ncontinued to be maintained for the 3-4 years while Applicant remained under his treatment. \nIn reaching his conclusion that AG \u00b6 28(b) was established, the Judge erred by failing to \nconsider these relevant factors and by failing to articulate a satisfactory explanation. \nDr. S\u2019s Testimony \nWhen Applicant received his SOR in November 2020, he became aware of Dr. B\u2019s \ndiagnosis of Bipolar II Disorder, as alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.b. Answer to SOR at 1. He discussed the \nSOR with his immediate supervisor and senior management. In the course of those discussions, \nsomeone suggested he obtain a third party evaluation (i.e., other than Dr. M and Dr. B) and \nrecommended Dr. S. Tr. at 123\u2013124. Dr. S is a licensed clinical social worker (LCSW) who also \nholds a Ph.D. in psychology. He has been in private practice as a LCSW since 1990. Id. at 26-27. \nApplicant began seeing Dr. S in December 2020 and continued to see him up to the hearing. Dr. \nS opined that Applicant does not have Bipolar Disorder or any other mental health conditions other \nthan being a \u201cperfectionist.\u201d Id. at 35. \nIn evaluating whether AG \u00b6 29(b) or \u00b6 29(c) mitigated the alleged security concerns, the \nJudge discounted Dr. S\u2019s testimony and opinion. In concluding those mitigating conditions did \nnot apply, the Judge stated, \u201cthere is no evidence Dr. S was acceptable to and approved by the U.S. \nGovernment, and he did not establish he is \u2018a duly qualified mental health professional.\u2019\u201d Decision \nat 11. We agree with the Judge\u2019s determination regarding AG \u00b6 29(c) because there no evidence \nthat Dr. S was acceptable to the U.S. Government, as required by that mitigating condition. See \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDirective, Encl. 2, App. A. \u00b6 29(c). However, we are puzzled by his determination regarding AG \n\u00b6 29(b), which provides, \u201cthe individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment program \nfor a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the individual is currently receiving counseling \nor treatment with a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified mental health professional.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 \n29(b). We note that, with the exception of the Judge\u2019s determination regarding Dr. S\u2019s professional \nqualifications, the record evidence tends to support the application of AG \u00b6 29(b). \nThe Judge\u2019s determination that Dr. S was not established as a duly qualified mental health \nprofessional is followed by the following statements: \nDr. S did not review Applicant\u2019s medical records and showed little interest in his \nmental health history. His diagnosis of \u201calmost perfectionistic\u201d was inconsistent \nwith the other diagnoses of multiple mental health experts who treated Applicant \nfrom 2005 to 2017.  [Decision at 11.] \nRegarding the first sentence of the apparent justification for the Judge\u2019s unfavorable \nconclusion regarding Dr. S\u2019s professional qualifications, we see no significant difference between \nDr. S\u2019s and Dr. B\u2019s review of Applicant\u2019s medical records and mental health history. As discussed \npreviously, Dr. B did not address Dr. M\u2019s medical records. As to the second sentence, Dr. M, who \ntreated Applicant from 2011 to 2016, reportedly told an investigator that Applicant\u2019s Obsessive \nCompulsive Disorder and anxiety cause him to be highly organized and a \u201cperfectionist.\u201d AE L \nat 46. Furthermore, Dr. S\u2019s opinion that Applicant did not meet the criteria for Bipolar Disorder \nis consistent with Dr. M\u2019s latest diagnosis that did not list that disorder. In fact, Dr. M\u2019s latest \ndiagnosis appears to align more with Dr. S\u2019s diagnosis than Dr. B\u2019s. Of note, Dr. B is the only \nmental health professional who specifically diagnosed Applicant with Bipolar II Disorder, and she \ncontradicts Dr. M\u2019s diagnosis by concluding Applicant\u2019s ADHD diagnosis \u201cdoes not seem \nplausible[.]\u201d  Government Exhibit 2 at 5.  Based on our review, we conclude that the Judge erred \nin failing to articulate a satisfactory explanation for concluding that Dr. S, a licensed clinical social \nworker for over 30 years, was not a duly qualified mental health professional under Guideline I.5 \nConclusion \nThe errors identified above warrant a remand. Given the Judge\u2019s expressed firm opinions \nabout Applicant\u2019s mitigating evidence, we conclude that the best resolution is to remand this case \nto a different judge for a new hearing. Under Directive E3.1.35, the Judge assigned the case is \nrequired to issue a new clearance decision. The Board retains no jurisdiction over a remanded \n5 The Concern paragraph (AG \u00b6 27) of Guideline I only references clinical psychologists and psychiatrists as examples \nof duly qualified mental health professionals employed by, or acceptable to, and approved by the U.S. Government, \nwho should be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and mitigating information under this guideline \nand a opinion prognosis is warranted. However, we do not interpret that paragraph as setting forth an exclusive list \nof duly qualified mental health professionals when applying the Guideline I disqualifying and mitigating conditions. \nOf note, Guidelines G and H list licensed clinical social workers as an example of a duly qualified medical and mental \nhealth professional. Furthermore, the pertinent revised Section 21 SCA question referenced in note 3, above, provides \nthat an applicant must disclose if he or she has \u201cEVER been diagnosed by a physician or other health professional (for \nexample, a psychiatrist, psychologist, licensed clinical social worker, or nurse practitioner)\u201d with one of the identified \nmental health disorders. Absent an adequate explanation to the contrary, a state licensed clinical social worker is a \nduly qualified mental health professional under Guideline I. \n9 \n\n \ndecision. However, the Judge\u2019s decision issued after remand may be appealed pursuant to \nDirective \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nOrder \nThe decision is REMANDED. \nSigned: James F.

Norman, Esq., Chief Department Counsel \nFOR APPLICANT \nPro se \nThe Department of Defense (DoD) declined to grant Applicant a trustworthiness \ndesignation. On October 30, 2020, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant \nof the basis for that decision \u2013 trustworthiness concerns raised under Guideline F (Financial \nConsiderations) of Department of Defense Directive 5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) \n(Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On November 3, 2021, after the close of the record, \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge Darlene D. Lokey \nAnderson denied Applicant\u2019s request for a trustworthiness designation. Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nApplicant raised the following issues on appeal: that the Judge failed to consider all the \nevidence and information presented to her; that the Judge erred in her findings of fact; that \nApplicant has, post-hearing, contacted creditors and begun making payments on her delinquent \ndebts; and that Applicant should not have been advised to file bankruptcy.

A high \nschool graduate, she served in the military on active duty and in the reserves for a total of nine \nyears. For her current employment, Applicant seeks access to sensitive information.  \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant had ten delinquent debts totaling in excess of $30,000. \nApplicant admitted seven of the ten debts alleged. Credit reports confirm that the three debts that \nshe denied are also still delinquent. Applicant has struggled financially after separating from the \nmilitary, largely because she receives little financial support from her child\u2019s father and is \nresponsible as a single parent for all household and child-related costs.  As a result, Applicant fell \ndelinquent on her auto loan, as well as on various consumer and utility debts. She has focused on \npaying her rent and resolving the auto loan deficiency. Applicant did not submit documents to \ncorroborate her testimony that the auto loan, which is alleged, is now current. She has made no \ninroads on the other nine debts alleged. All ten debts alleged in the SOR remain delinquent. \nApplicant began working for her current employer in July 2017. Letters and emails from \nher employer indicate that Applicant is a valued employee. She had intended to begin resolving \nher delinquent debt, but the Covid 19 pandemic complicated her finances, as siblings became \ndependent on her after losing their jobs. Post-hearing, Applicant submitted a budget and took steps \nto move in with a family member to reduce her monthly expenses.  \nDiscussion \nApplicant essentially asserts that the Judge did not take into account all available testimony \nand evidence in rendering the decision. As a preliminary matter, the Board notes that there is a \nrebuttable presumption that an Administrative Judge considered all the record evidence unless the \nJudge specifically states otherwise. See Western Pacific Fisheries, Inc. v. SS President Grant, 730 \nF.2d 1280, 1285 (9th Cir. 1984). More specifically, Applicant complains that the Judge described \nher as being \u201cat risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds,\u201d although she has no \ncriminal background, and that the Judge described Applicant\u2019s behavior as indicating \u201cpoor self-\ncontrol, lack of judgment or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulation,\u201d when her problems \nwere instead caused by single parenthood and inadequate pay. Appeal Brief at 1. First, it should \nbe noted that Applicant is complaining of the language of Adjudicative Guideline \u00b6 18, which the \nJudge cited to and quoted in her decision as the relevant trustworthiness concern for financial \nconsiderations. Second, while the Government is sympathetic to Applicant\u2019s struggles, it has a \ngreat interest in avoiding or reducing the risk that persons granted access to sensitive information \nmight mishandle or fail to properly safeguard such information because their unresolved financial \ndifficulties make them vulnerable or susceptible to bribery or other undue financial pressure. \nFurthermore, persons who are financially irresponsible might also be irresponsible, unconcerned, \nor negligent in the handling and safeguarding of protected information. Even in the absence of \nany illegal acts, Applicant\u2019s financial misfortune left her with financial difficulties that were \nunresolved as of the close of record in her case. The Judge does not need more to conclude that \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F were established. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 00-0104 at 5 (App. \nBd. Mar. 21, 2001). \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant also states that the Judge erred in finding that she has been with her current \nemployer since July 2017, as she has been with this employer only since March 2020. The record \nis not entirely clear on Applicant\u2019s recent employment history: it does, however, confirm that \nApplicant has been steadily employed since leaving active duty in 2013, but switched employers \nat some time after completing her security clearance application in January 2020. GE 1 at 15-18; \nTr. at 20, 23. To the extent that the Judge misunderstood Applicant\u2019s recent employment history, \nwe conclude that it would not have affected her analysis or decision, as Applicant was steadily \nemployed. An error that likely had no effect on the Judge\u2019s decision is harmless. See, e.g., ADP \nCase No. 13-01074 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2014). \nNone of Applicant\u2019s arguments are enough to rebut the presumption that the Judge \nconsidered all the evidence in the case. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01400 at 2 (App. Bd. Jun. 3, \n2020). To the extent that Applicant is more broadly arguing that the Judge mis-weighed the \nevidence, her arguments are not sufficient to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner \nthat was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Id. Applicant also cited to her post-hearing \nefforts to address her debts. Those efforts are not part of the record and constitute new evidence \nthat the Board may not consider.  See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29. \nFinally, Applicant asserts that the Judge advised her to consider bankruptcy. There is a \ndiscussion on the record by the Judge that could be interpreted as advising the Applicant to \nconsider filing for bankruptcy. Tr. at 40-43. The Board has previously noted that giving advice \nto Applicant on what to do to qualify for a security clearance would be inconsistent with the \nobligation to conduct adjudications in a fair and impartial manner. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 11\u00ad\n10499 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 21, 2013). The same holds true when the Applicant seeks a \ntrustworthiness designation. However, the Board does not have supervisory authority over the \nconduct of Hearing Office Administrative Judges. See ISCR Case No. 02-04344 at 3 (App. Bd. \nSep. 15, 2003). Upon review of this record, the Board concludes that the case outcome was not \naffected by the dialogue between Applicant and the Judge regarding any prospective bankruptcy, \nand that Applicant therefore was not prejudiced by the colloquy. \nThe Judge examined the relevant data and articulated a satisfactory explanation for the \ndecision. The decision is sustainable on this record. The standard applicable to trustworthiness \ncases is that set forth in Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) regarding \nsecurity clearances:  such a determination \u201cmay be granted only when \u2018clearly consistent with the \ninterests of the national security.\u2019\u201d See, e.g., ADP Case No. 17-03252 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 13, \n2018). Applicant\u2019s brief discloses no reason to disturb the Judge\u2019s conclusion that the evidence \nraises trustworthiness concerns under Guideline F.  \n3 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOrder \nThe decision is AFFIRMED. \nSigned: James F.

She cited to a paucity of \nevidence that Applicant had ever signed the requisite forms authorizing electronic filing of his \nreturns. She also noted inconsistencies in Applicant\u2019s evidence regarding the dates that his returns \nwere filed and the date his IRS lien was paid. She further commented: \nThe IRS repeatedly sent notices to Applicant regarding his unfiled tax returns.  \nThere is evidence that [Accountant 1] confirmed to Applicant in an October 2015 \nemail that the 2014 tax return was submitted. I have considered that Applicant \nbelieved [Accountant 2] had filed his 2013, 2014, and 2015 tax returns. Even if he \nbelieved that [Accountant 2] had timely filed his tax returns on his behalf, he was \nreceiving notices from the IRS regarding the unfiled tax returns and should have \ntaken action.

In the whole-person analysis, the \nJudge cited to DOHA precedent that failure to file returns and pay taxes when due suggests that \nan applicant has difficulty abiding by Government rules and that repeated failure to fulfill legal \nobligations impugns an applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. See, e.g, ISCR Case No. 17-01382 \nat 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018). Although Applicant\u2019s Federal and state tax debts are now paid and \nsome of his judgments satisfied, the Judge concluded that he had not demonstrated a reliable \nfinancial record. \nDiscussion \nApplicant notes the Judge\u2019s characterization of his evidence as confusing. He argues that \nhe had appeared pro se and that the Judge and/or Department Counsel failed to assist him in \nclearing up the evidence.  However, as Department Counsel argues on appeal, neither a Judge nor \na Department Counsel are obligated to assist an applicant in making his or her case for mitigation \nor otherwise serve as a surrogate for an applicant. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-04388 at 3 (App. \nBd. Aug. 1, 2018); ISCR Case No. 12-02329 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 17, 2015). The Directive places \nupon an applicant the responsibility for presenting evidence in mitigation, and even pro se \napplicants are expected to take reasonable steps in protecting their rights. Directive \u204b E3.1.15. See \nISCR Case No. 18-02689 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 26, 2019). The record shows that Applicant was \nnotified of his rights under the Directive, including the rights to an attorney, to present evidence \nin his behalf, and to call witnesses. \nPrehearing Guidance dated January 15, 2019. \nHe \nacknowledged receipt of this guidance at the hearing and advised that he was going to represent \nhimself. Tr. at 5-6. He presented numerous exhibits, which the Judge admitted, and he testified \nin his own behalf. Tr. at 22-23. Applicant may be dissatisfied with the outcome of his hearing, \nbut we find no reason to conclude that this outcome resulted from a deprivation of Applicant\u2019s due \nprocess rights by DOHA officials or that Applicant did not have adequate notice of those rights. \nApplicant was not denied any due process rights afforded by the Directive. \nRegarding the issue of factual sufficiency, Applicant contends the following:  \nThe Judge\u2019s failure to identify that the Applicant actually did not receive notice \nuntil 2017 [of his tax delinquencies] . . . articulates that the [Judge\u2019s] findings of \nfact are not supported by such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept \nas adequate to support a conclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same \nrecord.  Appeal Brief at 15.  \nIn essence, Applicant argues that the Judge should have found that he reasonably did not \nunderstand that his tax obligations had not been satisfied until an IRS agent showed up at his house.  \nIn fact, the Judge made findings about Applicant\u2019s testimony on this matter and addressed the \nfindings in her analysis. \nHowever, as she also found and the record shows, Applicant\u2019s \ncircumstances placed him on reasonable notice that his tax obligations may not have been satisfied, \nimposing on him a duty to inquire and ensure his compliance with his tax obligations. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n             \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n[Judge]: Do you file jointly? \n[Applicant]: Yes. \n[Judge]: So you have to sign [the relevant IRS forms]. \n[Applicant]:  Correct, although I think I was away.

We have held in prior cases that reliance upon a spouse to \nfulfill a couple\u2019s legal obligations does not absolve an applicant from remaining aware of the extent \nto which those obligations have been satisfied. \u201cThe degree of ignorance claimed by [the \napplicant] suggests an indifference to the proper satisfaction of legal obligations that draws into \nquestion his willingness or capacity to comply with the sometimes complex rules governing the \nhandling and safeguarding of classified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02914 at 4 (App. Bd. \nJan. 8, 2020). Similarly, in the case before us, the record includes evidence of things that should \nhave prompted Applicant to check on the state of his tax filings. The Judge\u2019s conclusion that \nApplicant\u2019s actual ignorance was not reasonable and was insufficient to mitigate the concerns in \nhis case is consistent with the record that was before her. Applicant has not demonstrated that the \nJudge\u2019s findings of fact contained any errors that undermine her overall conclusions. See, e.g. \nISCR Case No. 18-02581 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020). \nAs this issue suggests, Applicant\u2019s brief as a whole consists of a challenge to the manner \nin which the Judge weighed the evidence. However, an ability to argue for an alternative \ninterpretation of the record is not enough to show that the Judge weighed the evidence in a manner \nthat was arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Applicant has not demonstrated that the Judge \nmis-weighed the evidence, nor has he rebutted the presumption that the Judge considered all of the \nevidence in the record. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 18-02872 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2020). \nApplicant argues that the Judge analyzed his case \u201cin a fragmented fashion.\u201d Appeal Brief at 18. \nHowever, our review of the record convinces us that the Judge complied with the requirements of \nDirective \u00b6 6.3, in that she considered the totality of the evidence in reaching her decision.

The Judge \nfound for Applicant on one of the bank debts and entered adverse findings regarding the remaining \nSOR allegations. The Judge cited to Applicant\u2019s response during her clearance interview that she \n\u201cnever got around\u201d to filing her tax returns. Decision at 3. He also cited to her explanations for \nher tax delinquencies, such as her inability to find assistance in preparing her returns and an \nongoing history of social anxiety. Applicant conceded that she had no good reason for not having \nfiled her returns. The Judge noted Applicant\u2019s testimony that she had filed her returns during the \nweek prior to the hearing, although he stated that she did not provide documentary corroboration \nfor any returns other than those for tax year 2020.  \nThe Judge made findings regarding inconsistent statements Applicant had made, such as \nan earlier claim in her 2020 interrogatory response that she had filed her tax returns, followed by \nan admission on the following page of the response that she had yet to mail the returns to the tax \nauthorities. He noted her testimony that she had experienced unemployment, comparing it with \nher security clearance application in which she listed no periods of unemployment during the \nprevious 10 years. \nThe Judge resolved the larger of the two bank debts in Applicant\u2019s favor. However, he \ncited to evidence that Applicant had been aware for years that her tax returns were delinquent but \ndid not present documentary evidence of having filed any of them except for tax year 2020, which \nshe filed after the hearing. He concluded that her explanations for her conduct were not sufficient \nand cited to Applicant\u2019s inconsistent statements regarding her employment status. The Judge held \nthat Applicant had failed to mitigate the concerns raised in the SOR. \nDiscussion \nMuch of Applicant\u2019s brief provides context for her financial problems, for her inability to \ncorroborate that she had filed her tax returns, and for her inconsistent statements. Her arguments \ncontain matters from outside the record, which we cannot consider. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.29.

The Directive does not permit \nus to consider the impact of an adverse decision. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03024 at 3 (App. \nBd. Jan. 9, 2020). Applicant\u2019s arguments are not sufficient to show that the Judge\u2019s decision was \narbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law.

While working overseas, Applicant met his second \nwife, who is a citizen of Tunisia. In 2019, they married and moved back to the United States. The \ncouple has a newborn son.

In his Electronic Questionnaire \nfor Investigations Processing (e-QIP), Applicant noted weekly contact with his mother-in-law but \nstated he had a disagreement with her and no longer speaks to her. He does not communicate \nfrequently with his father-in-law due to the language barrier. His parents-in-law have no \nconnections with the Tunisian government. Applicant\u2019s sister-in-law is a citizen and resident of \nTunisia. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that he has no relation with her at all. She has \nno connection with the Tunisian government. Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law is a citizen of Tunisia, \nbut now lives in the United States. \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant denied that he provides support to his mother-in-law, \nbut he admitted that he sends her about $500 each month to cover some of his wife\u2019s remaining \nexpenses in Tunisia, to include a car loan and taxes on a business that his wife closed. In his \nresponse to the FORM, Applicant stated that he would no longer send money to Tunisia because \nhe is now aware that doing so could jeopardize his clearance. Applicant also stated that he has \nnever had any property, accounts, or other financial interests in Tunisia. He reported that his wife \nowns nothing in Tunisia other than the vehicle, which her parents now own. \nAdministrative Notice \nSignificant human rights issues exist in Tunisia including reports of unlawful or arbitrary \nkillings, primarily by terrorist groups; allegations of torture by government agents; arbitrary arrests \nand detentions of suspects under antiterrorism law; undue restrictions on freedom of expression \nand the press; widespread corruption, although the government took steps to combat it; violence \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntargeting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex persons; criminalization of consensual \nsame-sex conduct; and child labor.  \n\u201cThe U.S. Department of State continues to assess Tunisia at Level 4 (out of 4) , which \nindicates that travelers should not travel in the country due to crime, civil unrest, poor health \ninfrastructure, kidnapping, and arbitrary arrest and detention of U.S. citizens.\u201d  Decision at 7.    \nFinancial Considerations \nIn his e-QIP of October 2019, Applicant disclosed several financial issues, to include a \nFederal and state tax debt of $8,000, a vehicle repossession, and a wage garnishment in 2019. \nIn his clearance interviews of early 2020, Applicant stated that his Federal and state tax \nreturns were filed and that he owed about $11,000 for both. He stated that no wages were \ngarnished. Regarding the other delinquencies, he either disputed the accounts or stated that they \nhad been removed from his credit report. \nThe 11 delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR total about $53,000 and remain unresolved. \nThe largest debt is an automobile loan with an unpaid balance of $46,000 that was placed for \ncollection and charged off.  \nThe SOR alleged that Applicant is indebted to the Federal government for delinquent taxes \nof $7,000 for tax years 2017 and 2018. In his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that he owed \nnothing for 2018 and is trying to file for 2017. However, in his 2019 e-QIP, Applicant disclosed \nthat he owed about $8,000.  \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant owes $5,500 for state taxes for TYs 2017 and 2018. In his \nsubject interview, Applicant acknowledged that debt. In his Answer to the SOR, he stated that he \ndid not owe anything. In his response to the FORM, Applicant stated that he had been mistaken \nabout owing state taxes.  \nThe SOR alleges a wage garnishment in November 2019 in the approximately amount of \n$600 bi-weekly. \u201cHe denies that he ever worked for this company and that there was no \ngarnishment.\u201d Decision at 4.  \nJudge\u2019s Analysis \nForeign Influence \n[Applicant\u2019s inlaws live] in Tunisia and she talks to her family on the phone. \nApplicant has spoken with his in-laws when they call to speak to his wife.

The other SOR \nallegations concerned tax indebtedness for 2017 and 2018 to the Federal government in the amount \nof $7,000 and to the state in the amount of $5,500. Applicant denied owing these various accounts \nin his Answer to the SOR but admitted or denied them in his subject interview. Applicant stated \nthat he had a plan to pay the taxes, but he presented no evidence of payments on the delinquent \naccounts or his tax debt.  None of the mitigating conditions fully apply. \nDiscussion \nIn his appeal brief, Applicant contends that the Judge erred in several factual \ndeterminations and in her conclusions drawn from them.  We conclude that Applicant\u2019s argument \nhas merit.  \nWe examine disputed findings of fact to determine if they are supported by substantial \nevidence, i.e., \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a \nconclusion in light of all the contrary evidence in the same record.\u201d Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. In \nconducting such an examination, the Board must consider not only whether there is record \nevidence supporting a Judge\u2019s findings, but also whether there is evidence that fairly detracts from \nthe weight of the evidence supporting those findings, and whether the Judge\u2019s findings reflect a \nreasonable interpretation of the record evidence as a whole. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 02-12199 at \n3 (App. Bd. Aug. 8, 2005). \nIn deciding whether the Judge\u2019s conclusions are erroneous, the Appeal Board will review \nthe Judge\u2019s decision to determine whether: it does not examine relevant evidence; it fails to \n1 AG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business or professional associate, friend, \nor other person who is a citizen of or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of foreign \nexploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n2 AG \u00b6 7(e): shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of citizenship status, if that relationship \ncreates a heightened risk of foreign inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \n4 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \narticulate a satisfactory explanation for its conclusions, including a rational connection between \nthe facts found and the choice made; it does not consider relevant factors; it reflects a clear error \nof judgment; it fails to consider an important aspect of the case; it offers an explanation for the \ndecision that runs contrary to the record evidence; or it is so implausible that it cannot be ascribed \nto a mere difference of opinion. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-02563 at 4 (App. Bd. Aug. 28, 2015). \nGuideline B Errors: The Judge erred in her findings and conclusions regarding the \nGuideline B allegations. \nFirst, the Judge concluded that Tunisia poses a \u201cheightened risk\u201d due to its \u201ccontinued \nrepressive, authoritarian, and anti-American regime which supports known terrorist groups.\u201d \nDecision at 9. \nThis conclusion is unsupported by any evidence of record. \nIndeed, the \nGovernment\u2019s administrative notice regarding conditions in Tunisia directly contradicts the \nJudge\u2019s conclusion. The administrative notice highlight Tunisia\u2019s \u201cpartnership with the United \nStates\u201d and its commitment to counterterrorism efforts, which \u201chave steadily degraded violent \nextremist organizations\u2019 capacity within the country.\u201d Administrative Notice (AN) Item 3 at 2. \nMoreover, Tunisia has implemented a strategy to prevent and counter violent extremism and has \nfrozen terrorist assets, demonstrating \u201cimprovements in [counterterrorism] crisis response, \ncoordination, and investigation.\u201d Id. \nSecond, the Judge found that the U.S. State Department \u201ccontinues to assess Tunisia at \nLevel 4 (out of 4) . . . due to crime, civil unrest, poor health infrastructure, kidnapping, and arbitrary \narrest and detention of U.S. citizens.\u201d  Decision at 7. This finding is unsupported by the evidence \nof record. Although the State Department cautions against travel to particular regions due to \nterrorism, it assessed the country at Level 4 due to its Covid 19 situation. The conditions cited by \nthe Judge are not found in the State Department\u2019s travel advisory for Tunisia. AN at 3; AN Item \n2 at 1. \nRegarding both of the above errors, we are unable to discern what record evidence the \nJudge relied upon to make those findings of fact. The Directive entitles applicants to have \ntrustworthiness concerns adjudicated on evidence of record and not on evidence from unknown \nsources. See, e.g., Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1. In short, the Judge\u2019s findings in question run contrary \nto the record evidence. \nThird, the SOR alleges that Applicant provides $500 per month in support to his mother-\nin-law, a citizen and resident of Tunisia, and the Judge found against Applicant on the allegation \nas drafted. This allegation is not supported by record evidence. Applicant disclosed in his October \n2019 e-QIP that he provided $500 per month to his mother-in-law. FORM Item 3 at 43-44. \nHowever, in his February 2020 clearance interview, he explained the payments to his mother-in\u00ad\nlaw were to resolve bills that his wife owed in Tunisia, to include a car loan and costs associated \nwith closing her business there. FORM Item 6 at 7.  \nIn the FORM, Department Counsel recognized that the evidence did not support the \nallegation as drafted, but he neither amended nor withdrew the allegation. FORM at 6. The Judge \nalso recognized that the evidence did not establish the allegation but instead established that \nApplicant \u201chas in past years sent money to his mother-in-law to pay for his wife\u2019s car loan and \n5 \n\n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \ntaxes.\u201d Decision at 9. However, the Judge neither amended the SOR nor, more importantly, \naddressed how paying a spouse\u2019s bills raises a Guideline B trustworthiness concern. Cf. Guideline \nF, AG \u00b6\u00b6 18\u201319. The Judge\u2019s adverse conclusion regarding this allegation is defective because \nshe failed to articulate a satisfactory explanation for it, to include a rational connection between \nthe facts found and the choice made. \nGuideline F Errors: The Judge erred in her findings and conclusions regarding the \nGuideline F allegations. \nFirst, the Judge found adversely to Applicant on the two tax delinquency allegations and \nthe wage garnishment allegation. These alleged that Applicant is indebted to the Federal \ngovernment for delinquent taxes in the amount of $7,000 for tax years 2017 and 2018 (SOR \u00b6 2.l); \nthat he is indebted to his state for delinquent taxes in the amount of $5,500 for tax years 2017 and \n2018 (SOR \u00b6 2.m); and that his wages at Employer A were garnished in about November 2019 in \nthe approximate amount of $600.00 bi-weekly and that the garnishment order is not completed \n(SOR \u00b6 2.n). As noted above, Applicant denied each of these allegations in responding to the \nSOR. The summary of Applicant\u2019s background interview is the only record evidence supporting \nthe wage garnishment and certain aspects of the tax delinquencies.3 Regarding this issue, the Judge \nerred in finding that Applicant disclosed the wage garnishment in his e-QIP.  \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.20 requires authentication of a DoD Report of Investigation, including the \nsummary of an applicant\u2019s interview, for it to be admissible in a DOHA proceeding. There is no \nindication in the record that Applicant was sent interrogatories requesting that he adopt his \nsummary of interview as accurate. In the FORM, Department Counsel noted, \u201cApplicant\u2019s \ndelinquent taxes and wage garnishment are established by his subject interview.\u201d FORM at 5. In \nthat document, Department Counsel also advised Applicant that the summary of his interview \nwould be provided to the Judge and that Applicant may \u201cmake any corrections, additions, \ndeletions, and updates necessary to make the summaries clear and accurate.\u201d  FORM at 2.  \nIn his FORM response, Applicant did not object to the interview summary for lack of \nauthentication, but he did make corrections to it. With regard to the state taxes, Applicant asserted, \n\u201cI was previously mistaken about owing [State] tax money for any previous years. . . . In 2020 as \nI recall, I was asked to estimate my potential tax liability. As it turned out I owed nothing.\u201d FORM \nResponse at 3. With regard to Federal taxes, Applicant stated that he \u201cstill owe[s] back taxes for \n2017 federal income tax but I\u2019m waiting for a total and a settlement agreement.\u201d Id. Regarding \nthe alleged garnishment, he denied that his pay was currently being garnished in both his SOR and \nFORM responses and explained in his FORM response that he now works for a different company \nand that the garnishment is complete. FORM Items 6 at 9 and 2 at 3; FORM Response at 1 and 3.  \nIn his SOR and FORM responses, Applicant effectively refuted portions of his summary \nof interview. Under these circumstances, the Judge had no basis for concluding that Applicant \nwas authenticating or adopting the refuted portions of the interview summary or was waiving any \nobjections to those portions. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01649 at 2\u20133 (App. Bd. Jan. 6, 2021). \nThe Judge erred by failing to exclude those refuted portions from evidence. In ruling adversely to \nApplicant on the tax and wage garnishment allegations, the Judge failed to address important \n3 In his e-QIP, Applicant made disclosures about the tax delinquencies that prove aspects of those allegations. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n  \nevidentiary aspects of the case and failed to conduct a meaningful analysis of whether there was \nsufficient admissible evidence to establish those allegations. \nSecond, the Judge\u2019s findings exaggerate the amount of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debt. The \nlargest delinquent debt alleged, by far, is an auto loan purportedly charged off for approximately \n$46,790 (SOR \u00b6 2.a). In the FORM, Department Counsel recognized that the charge off was \ninstead approximately $29,100, but he did not amend the SOR. FORM at 4. The Judge found \nagainst Applicant on the erroneously larger figure and relied upon it in her analysis by stating that \nApplicant\u2019s aggregate debt totaled about $53,300. Decision at 12. Applicant\u2019s aggregate \ndelinquent debt is instead approximately $36,000.4 While this is still a significant figure, the Board \ndeclines under these circumstances to say that an error of $17,000 is harmless, i.e, that it did not \nlikely have an impact on the outcome of the case. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 19-01220 at 3 (App. \nBd. Jun. 1, 2020). This charged off auto loan is Applicant\u2019s only sizable debt, and he disputes \nresponsibility for the account, citing to a property division in his divorce decree. FORM Item 2 \nat 2. \nOther Errors \nIn his appeal, Applicant contends the Judge erred in entering findings that call his honesty \ninto question. For example, regarding the wage garnishment allegation, the Judge found that \nApplicant \u201cdenies that he ever worked for this company and that there was no garnishment.\u201d \nDecision at 4. Applicant claims this finding is \u201ccompletely false.\u201d Appeal Brief at 1. Our review \nof the record confirms that Applicant disclosed the garnishment in his subject interview, denied \nthat he was currently under garnishment in his SOR Response, and explained that he now works \nfor a different company and that the garnishment was complete in his FORM Response. FORM \nItems 6 at 9 and 2 at 3; FORM Response at 1 and 3. Although the Judge did not explicitly make \na credibility determination regarding Applicant, we conclude that her findings implicitly call his \ncredibility into question.  \nConclusion \nGiven these errors, we conclude that the best resolution is to remand this case to a different \njudge for reprocessing. Applicant should be provided the opportunity to request a hearing. Under \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.35, the Judge assigned the case is required to issue a new clearance decision. The \nBoard retains no jurisdiction over a remanded decision. However, the new decision may be \nappealed pursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \n4 Additionally, the Judge erred in finding the debt of $1,635 alleged at SOR \u00b6 1.c unresolved (Decision at 3), as the \nGovernment\u2019s credit report reflects that the collection was paid.

To that end, he cited to non-classified information available on websites maintained by the State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency. From these sources he made findings to the effect that human rights violations frequently occur in Kosovo and that government officials are often corrupt. He went on to find: Persistent ethnic strife, terrorist activities, an uneven human rights record, and other conditions on which the State Department has based its travel advisories for Kosovo, all support a finding that there is a heightened risk associated with having personal and financial ties there. Decision at 6 (emphasis added). The particular documents upon which the Judge based these findings are not included in the record. This raises two issues.

On \nJune 23, 2021, DoD issued a statement of reasons (SOR) advising Applicant of the basis for that \ndecision\u2013security concerns raised under Guideline B (Foreign Influence) of Defense Directive \n5220.6 (Jan. 2, 1992, as amended) (Directive). Applicant requested a hearing. On October 14, \n2022, after the hearing, Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) Administrative Judge \nMatthew E. Malone denied Applicant\u2019s request for a security clearance. Applicant appealed \npursuant to Directive \u00b6\u00b6 E3.1.28 and E3.1.30. \nWe construe Applicant\u2019s brief as challenging the Judge\u2019s conclusion that his circumstances \nraise Guideline B security concerns. In resolving this assignment of error we must address certain \nthreshold issues on record completeness and the extent to which Applicant may have been denied \nthe due process afforded by the Directive.  \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \nIn its case in chief, the Government requested that the Judge take administrative notice of \na U.S. Department of State document entitled U.S. Relations with Kosovo. Though acknowledging \nthat terrorist activity occurs in Kosovo, the general tenor of the document is that Kosovo is a strong \npartner of the U.S., working closely with us to become a prosperous democracy and to maintain \npeace and regional security. Government Exhibit (GE) 4, Request for Administrative Notice. GE \n4 contains no documents other than the State Department fact sheet. Though he granted the \nGovernment\u2019s request, the Judge expressed some skepticism as to whether GE 4 included \nsufficient information to enable him to make a reasoned determination regarding heightened risk, \na central criterion underlying Guideline B analysis. Tr. at 62-63. \nIn the Decision, the Judge stated that he had considered the contents of GE 4 but that he \nrequired additional information about Kosovo. To that end, he cited to non-classified information \navailable on websites maintained by the State Department and the Central Intelligence Agency. \nFrom these sources he made findings to the effect that human rights violations frequently occur in \nKosovo and that government officials are often corrupt. He went on to find: \nPersistent ethnic strife, terrorist activities, an uneven human rights record, and other \nconditions on which the State Department has based its travel advisories for \nKosovo, all support a finding that there is a heightened risk associated with having \npersonal and financial ties there. Decision at 6 (emphasis added). \nThe particular documents upon which the Judge based these findings are not included in \nthe record. This raises two issues. First, as it stands the record is not complete. We have held in \nthe past that merely citing to a website or URL is not sufficient to preserve an issue for appellate \nreview. We \u201ccannot consider in a vacuum, without reference to a properly developed record,\u201d \nwhether a Judge\u2019s notice or treatment of pertinent documents is sustainable. ADP Case No. 14\u00ad\n01655 at 2 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2015). See also ISCR Case No. 00-0628 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Apr. 26, \n2002). It is the Judge\u2019s responsibility to ensure that the record is complete, and in this case it is \nnot. This impairs our ability to address the applicability of Guideline B disqualifying conditions, \nin particular the issue of heightened risk. \nSecondly, there nothing to show that Applicant received copies of the documents in \nquestion before the record closed. While a Judge has authority to take administrative notice of \nappropriate matters sua sponte (see, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03026 at 4, n. 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 16, \n2019)), an applicant enjoys the right to present evidence in mitigation. In order for an applicant to \nexercise this right effectively, he must have notice of the evidence to be asserted against him. For \nthe Judge to have based the decision, even in part, on information of which Applicant was never \nmade aware denied him of a reasonable opportunity to prepare for the hearing. That is, Applicant \nhad no reason to know that the relatively harsh assessment of the political situation of Kosovo \ncontained in the documents noticed sua sponte would be brought to bear on the adjudication of his \ncase.1 Had the Judge made him aware of the documents he could possibly have sought additional \n1GE 4 contained the following assertion by the Department Counsel: \u201cIn the present case, the Government\u2019s \nheightened risk concern is based primarily upon Applicant\u2019s various ties to Kosovo . . . rather than specific country \nconditions therein.\u201d GE 4 at 2. This further underscores that Applicant had no reason to believe that political \nconditions in Kosovo would likely be determinative and that he should focus his preparation on addressing the nature \nof his family and economic ties with that country. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                       \n \nevidence or other administrative notice material that could have supported his effort to obtain a \nclearance. Under the facts of this case, Applicant was denied due process. Compare, ISCR Case \nNo. 15-04472 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 9, 2017). \nAccordingly, we conclude that the best resolution of the issues before us is to remand the \ncase to the Judge to identify the particular documents upon which he relied, provide them to \nApplicant and Department Counsel for inspection and for any objections they may have, and \ninclude them in the evidentiary record. After providing Applicant and Department Counsel an \nopportunity to address the documents in question and present additional evidence if desired, the \nJudge will issue a new decision. We do not retain jurisdiction over remanded cases. After the \nJudge issues a new decision, the appropriate party can appeal pursuant to Directive \u204b\u204b E3.1.28-35. \nOther issues in Applicant\u2019s brief are not ripe for consideration. \nOrder \nThe Decision is REMANDED. \nSigned: James F.
