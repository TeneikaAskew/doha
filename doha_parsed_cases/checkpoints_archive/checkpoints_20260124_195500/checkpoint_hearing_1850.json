(HE 2) His debts resulted from medical treatments at the same hospital\u2019s \nemergency room. He received medical tests, such as CAT scans, MRIs, X-rays, and an \nendoscopy. (Tr. 20, 23) In 2015 or 2016, Applicant borrowed $5,000 and used the funds \nto pay some of medical debts which were not listed on the SOR. (Tr. 28, 30, 49) He paid \nthe debts when the creditors said they would take him to court. (Tr. 30) He repaid the \n$5,000 loan. (Tr. 49) After Applicant received the SOR, he contacted the medical entity \nand he learned there were 14 medical debts, and he also learned the total owed was \n$30,461. (AE B) The creditor offered to settle the debt for $6,692. (Tr. 27; AE B) The \ndebts were accumulated from August 19, 2010 ($6,649), to January 29, 2019 ($103). He \nindicated he made five payments totaling $617 toward five of the medical debts for $276, \n$40, $95, $103, and $103. (AE B) The $276 payment matches the $1,382 debt in SOR \u00b6 \n1.e, and he is credited with mitigating this debt. The other four paid debts he paid are not \nlisted on the SOR. He provided receipts showing three payments totaling $534 as follows: \nApril 11, 2021 ($135); August 12, 2021 ($296); and September 9, 2021 ($103). (AE C) \nPresumably the $534 total is included in the $617 amount. He indicated at his hearing the \nmedical debt was now $6,396. (Tr. 27, 29) Most of his delinquent medical debts have \nbeen dropped from his current credit report. (GE 6) \nWhen the COVID-19 epidemic began, Applicant applied for and received a \nmortgage forbearance, and the amount of his Federal Housing Administration (FHA) \nmortgage went from $150,000 to $163,000 as the deferred interest payments were added \nonto the mortgage. (Tr. 32-33) His monthly mortgage payment was $1,200. (Tr. 45) His \nstudent loans are in a COVID-19 deferral. (Tr. 40) Applicant\u2019s annual income is $56,000, \nand his spouse\u2019s annual income is about $20,000. (Tr. 47-48) Applicant is making his \nrequired payments on two vehicle loans. (Tr. 39; GE 5) His state and federal income taxes \nare current. (Tr. 41) He has $19,500 in his 401(k) account, about $1,700 in a stock-\ninvestment account, and about $1,300 in his savings account. (Tr. 42, 49) He has not had \nfinancial counseling. (Tr. 45) He uses a budget to manage his payments. (Tr. 44) \nApplicant\u2019s budget indicates his family\u2019s net monthly income is $5,350, his monthly \nexpenses are $2,980, and his net monthly remainder is $2,370. (AE D) Applicant has \nabout $1,400 extra each month because of the deferment and/or forbearance in the \npayment of his mortgage and student loans, and he used the extra funds to repair his car \n($2,000), and to buy a computer, dishwasher, washer, and dryer. (Tr. 43, 48) He also paid \na few bills. (Tr. 48) He received $2,000 or $3,200 from the federal government for COVID\u00ad\n19 relief, and he used the funds to pay credit card debt and some other debts. (Tr. 50) \nApplicant\u2019s 2019 federal income tax return indicates he and his spouse\u2019s adjusted \ngross income (AGI) was about $65,700, and his federal income tax refund was about \n$3,700. (AE E) His 2020 federal income tax return indicates he and his spouse\u2019s AGI was \nabout $61,000, and his federal income tax refund was about $3,600.

Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nfacts.

Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.   \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, \n2010), the Appeal Board explained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations.

The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating \nconditions. Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the mitigation \nsection, infra. \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and  \n \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.

A debt \nthat became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can \napplicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, \ncan be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 \n(App. Bd.

However, \u201c[e]ven if \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since \nacted in a reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd.

A component is whether he or she \nmaintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep \ndebts current. Applicant did not provide supporting documentary evidence that he \nmaintained contact with creditors. After he received the SOR, he discussed a settlement \nand payment plan with the creditor; however, he said he only made payments totaling \nabout $617 from April to September 2021. His payments are insufficient to establish a \ntrack record of payments, or good-faith mitigation of his delinquent SOR debt. \nSeveral of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts have been either charged off or dropped \nfrom his credit report or both. \u201c[A] creditor\u2019s choice to charge-off a debt for accounting \npurposes does not affect the debtor\u2019s obligation to the creditor.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-02760 \nat 3 (App. Bd.

There \nis insufficient assurance that his financial problems are being resolved. Under all the \ncircumstances, he failed to establish mitigation of financial considerations security \nconcerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is 30 years old, and he has been employed in electrical design for fleet \nsustainment since 2017. In 2018, he was awarded an associate\u2019s degree in 3D drafting \nand design. There is no evidence that Applicant violated his employer\u2019s rules, committed \ncriminal conduct, used illegal drugs, or abused alcohol. \nApplicant provided important financial mitigating information. His finances were \nharmed by several circumstances beyond his control. Most of his non-medical debts are \neither in forbearance, deferment, or current. He paid $617 to address his medical debts \nfrom April to September 2021, including $276, which resolved the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.e for \n$1,382. He timely filed his federal and state income tax returns. He uses a budget to pay \nhis debts. \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is more substantial at this time. \nApplicant did not provide documentation about why he was unable to make greater \ndocumented progress resolving the seven delinquent SOR debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, \n1.d, 1.f, and 1.g. It is unclear why he did not use more of the extra funds from the \nforbearance of his mortgage and deferment of his student loans to address the SOR \ndebts. His lack of responsible financial action raises unmitigated questions about his \nreliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified information.

Jan. 3, 2020) (citing ISCR Case \nNo.12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd.

I have carefully applied the law, \nas set forth in Egan, Exec.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are useful in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration \nof the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of \nthe national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                                                                                 \n                                                                                                                                          \n                                                               \n                                                                                                                                                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline I \u2013 Psychological Conditions  \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Psychological Conditions is set \nforth at AG \u00b6 27: \nCertain emotional, mental, and personality conditions can impair \njudgment, reliability, or trustworthiness. A formal diagnosis of a disorder is \nnot required for there to be a concern under this guideline. A duly qualified \nmental health professional (e.g. clinical psychologist or psychiatrist) \nemployed by, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government, \nshould be consulted when evaluating potentially disqualifying and \nmitigating information under this guideline and an opinion, including \nprognosis, should be sought. No negative inference concerning the \nstandards in this guideline may be raised solely on the basis of mental \nhealth counseling. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 28 contains five conditions that could raise a security \nconcern and may be disqualifying. Two conditions are established: \n(b) an opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional that the \nindividual  has a condition that may impair judgment, stability, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; and \n(c) voluntary or involuntary inpatient hospitalization.       \nAppellant received voluntary inpatient treatment for Schizophrenia in 2013. In \n2019, he was assessed by a licensed psychologist who had serious concern as to his \ntrustworthiness, reliability and judgment. Therefore, AG \u00b6 28 is established. \nThe guideline at AG \u00b6 29 contains five conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns. Five conditions may be applicable: \n(a) the identified condition is readily controlled with treatment, and the \nindividual has demonstrated ongoing and consistent compliance with \nthe treatment plan; \n(b) the individual has voluntarily entered a counseling or treatment \nprogram for a condition that is amenable to treatment, and the \nindividual is currently receiving counseling or treatment with a \nfavorable prognosis by a duly qualified metal health professional; \n(c) recent opinion by a duly qualified mental health professional employed \nby, or acceptable to and approved by the U.S. Government that an \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s previous condition is under control or in remission, and has \na low probability of recurrence or exacerbation; \n(d) the past psychological/psychiatric condition was temporary, the \nsituation has been resolved, and the individual no longer shows \nindications of emotional instability; and \n(e) there is no indication of a current problem. \nAppellant has been recently assessed as suffering not from Schizophrenia, but \nfrom Depression, in remission. That being said, where national security is at issue; and \nin an abundance of caution, I defer to the 2019 opinion \u201cby a duly qualified mental-\nhealth professional employed by, or acceptable to and approved by, or acceptable to \nand approved by the U.S. Government that an individual\u2019s previous condition\u201d is not \nunder control nor in remission. Therefore, AG \u00b6 29 is not established. Psychological \nConditions is found against Applicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of an applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nAG \u00b6 2(b) requires each case must be judged on its own merits. Under AG \u00b6 \n2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security clearance \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines and the whole person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. While Applicant is well respected in \nthe workplace (AppXs B and C), overall, the record evidence leaves me with questions \nand doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all \nthese reasons, I conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the security concerns arising \nfrom his Psychological Conditions. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline I:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of February 14, 2020, Applicant had not filed his federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2014 through 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). When he responded to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegation without explanation. After considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is a 32-year-old test analyst. He has worked for his current employer, a defense contractor, since October 2017. His current duties do not require that he hold a DOD security clearance, but having a clearance would allow him to perform work for his employer on U.S. military installations. (GE 1; Tr. 23-24.) 2 Before this career opportunity, he was employed or self-employed as an automobile repair technician. (GE 1; Tr. 20.) He has never married and has no children, but he has been in a cohabitant relationship with his girlfriend since May 2018. (GE 1.) After graduating from high school, Applicant worked as a technician for a car dealership while also attending school to be an automotive technician. He graduated from his schooling in 2008 and left the employment of the car dealership voluntarily in approximately May 2009 to work for an independent garage, where he felt he could improve his skills in the trade.

The \nSOR explained why the DCSA CAF was unable to find it clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant or continue security clearance eligibility for him. The DCSA CAF took the \naction under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDetermining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive \nPosition (AG) effective within the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant responded to the SOR allegation on March 25, 2020, and he requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals \n(DOHA). Referral of the case to the Hearing Office was delayed because of the COVID \npandemic. On February 17, 2021, Department Counsel indicated that the Government was \nready to proceed to a hearing. On February 25, 2021, the case was assigned to me to \nconduct a hearing to determine whether it is clearly consistent with the national security \ninterests of the United States to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant. I \nreceived the case assignment and file on March 4, 2021. On March 8, 2021, I informed \nApplicant of the possibility of an online video hearing, which he accepted on March 15, \n2021. Following a successful test of the Defense Collaboration Services (DCS) system on \nApril 2, 2021, on April 8, 2021, I issued a notice scheduling Applicant\u2019s DCS video \nteleconference hearing for April 29, 2021. \nThe online hearing was held as scheduled. Three Government exhibits (GEs 1-3) \nwere admitted into the record without any objections. Applicant testified, as reflected in a \nhearing transcript (Tr.) received on May 11, 2021. \nThe record was held open, initially for two weeks after Applicant\u2019s hearing, for him to \nsubmit documentary evidence. On May 12, 2021, Applicant submitted two documents (AEs \nA-B), which were admitted into the record as exhibits without any objections. Applicant\u2019s \nforwarding email, which contained some representations about efforts to resolve his tax \nfilings, was marked and accepted into evidence as AE C without any comment from the \nGovernment. In his May 12, 2021 email message, Applicant referenced a screen shot of a \npayment made for delinquent sales and use tax that was apparently mistakenly not \nattached to his email. I reopened the record to provide Applicant an opportunity to submit \nevidence of that payment, which was received on June 1, 2021. The document was \naccepted into the record as AE D without any objections. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline F that, as of February 14, 2020, Applicant had not \nfiled his federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2014 through 2018 (SOR \u00b6 1.a). \nWhen he responded to the SOR, Applicant admitted the allegation without explanation. \nAfter considering the pleadings, exhibits, and transcript, I make the following findings of \nfact. \nApplicant is a 32-year-old test analyst. He has worked for his current employer, a \ndefense contractor, since October 2017. His current duties do not require that he hold a \nDOD security clearance, but having a clearance would allow him to perform work for his \nemployer on U.S. military installations.

(GE 1; Tr. 20.) He has never married and has no children, but he has \nbeen in a cohabitant relationship with his girlfriend since May 2018. (GE 1.) \nAfter graduating from high school, Applicant worked as a technician for a car \ndealership while also attending school to be an automotive technician. He graduated from \nhis schooling in 2008 and left the employment of the car dealership voluntarily in \napproximately May 2009 to work for an independent garage, where he felt he could \nimprove his skills in the trade. Due to a decline in business at the garage, Applicant was \nlaid off in May 2012. (GE 1.) \nApplicant collected unemployment from May 2012 to December 2012, when he \ndecided to start his own automobile repair shop. For income tax purposes, he was self-\nemployed until October 2016. (Tr. 20.) IRS publication 334, which provides tax guidance \nfor small businesses that use schedule C (sole proprietor), indicates that tax returns are to \nbe filed under the sole-proprietor\u2019s social security number but also that an employer \nidentification number is required if either wages were paid to one or more employees, or \nthe business filed pension or excise tax returns. See www.irs.gov. Section 6017 of Title 26 \nof the United States Code provides that a tax return is required to be filed if net earnings \nfrom self-employment are $400 or more. Applicant provided little detail about his income \nand expenses while self-employed from December 2012 to October 2016, other than that \nhe struggled financially at times. In May 2016, he decided to move to a larger shop. He felt \nhe had outgrown his previous space and wanted to bring in a business partner. Over the \nnext few months, Applicant struggled to keep his business afloat. He was unable to find a \ncompatible person to share the space, and he closed his shop in October 2016. (GE 1.) \nApplicant had \u201cdeveloped a proficient mechanical skillset,\u201d but he lost interest in \nworking in the automotive repair industry. He was unemployed from October 2016 to May \n2017 while deliberating his next career move and looking for employment in other fields of \ninterest to him. From May 2017 to December 2017, Applicant worked as a mechanic for a \nlimousine service at $23 an hour. His income met or exceeded the minimum required to file \nincome tax returns for tax year 2017. (Tr. 39-40.) He enjoyed working for the limousine \nservice, but left voluntarily for a career opportunity with his current employer. (GE 1.) \nOn January 19, 2019, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF 86). In response to a financial record inquiry into whether, in the last seven \nyears, he had failed to file or pay federal, state, or other taxes when required by law or \nordinance, Applicant reported that he had not filed his federal or state income tax returns or \npaid taxes owed for tax years 2014, 2015, and 2016. He stated with respect to each of \nthose tax years: \nDuring the years of 2013-2016, I ran my own automotive business. At first I \ntried to do my own taxes, but after struggling reached out to a professional. \nThese years have still not been finalized but are being worked on currently \nwith plans to [have] past taxes resolved in 2019.

He also reported on his SF 86 that \nhe had not yet filed his federal and state income tax returns for tax year 2017, for which he \nexpected refunds that he would not receive \u201cdue to [his] prior negligence.\u201d He explained \nthat he had not filed his income tax returns for 2017 \u201cbecause [he] was worried about doing \nthe taxes [himself] and creating an issue since [he] still had a business account open.\u201d He \nadded that his delinquent returns for 2017 would be resolved in 2019. (GE 1.) \nOn May 8, 2019, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM). With respect to his delinquent tax returns and \ntaxes owed, Applicant attributed his tax issues to being a first-time business owner and not \nknowing how to properly prepare his returns. He stated that he retained the services of an \naccountant in 2015 to prepare his tax returns. He explained that he had yet to file his tax \nreturns for tax year 2017 because he was waiting to hear from his accountant. He \nexpressed an intent to begin paying any past-due taxes in August 2019 after hearing from \nhis accountant. Applicant denied any possibility of recurrence because a professional was \nnow handing his tax issues. (GE 2.) \nAs of September 30, 2019, Applicant had not filed his federal or state income tax \nreturns or paid any outstanding taxes for tax years 2014 through 2018. He explained in \nresponse to DOD interrogatories that he had not filed his federal and state tax returns \ninitially \u201cdue to not having employment and unstable income,\u201d but that he was currently \nworking with a tax specialist to file his returns for those tax years. He hoped to have \n\u201cclosure\u201d by the end of 2019. (GE 3.) \nAt his hearing, Applicant explained that he had hired an accountant in 2015 to \naddress his unfiled tax returns for tax years 2013 through 2016. (Tr. 37.) With the \nassistance of the accountant, Applicant filed his federal and state income tax returns for \n2013 late. (Tr. 25.) He acknowledged that he had not been diligent about ensuring that his \ntax returns for tax years 2014 through 2016 be prepared in a timely fashion, although he \nhad provided the accountant with documentation when asked. (Tr. 30, 35.) \nApplicant did not retain professional assistance to file his tax returns for tax years \n2017 through 2019, and he allowed the tax-filing deadlines to pass without making any \neffort to file his tax returns. He had taxes withheld from his employment earnings for those \ntax years, but he feared the possible consequences to him because his returns for tax \nyears 2014 through 2016 had not been filed. He testified that he did not know what to do. \n(Tr. 20-21.) He did not seek any professional advice about his filing obligations, to include \nfrom the accountant handling his tax issues for tax years 2014 through 2016. (Tr. 37.) \nThe accountant handling Applicant\u2019s income taxes for tax years 2014 through 2016 \npassed away sometime during the latter half of 2020. (Tr. 35.) Applicant had given that \naccountant all the paperwork that he had regarding tax years 2014 through 2016, and so \nhe had to \u201cstart over.\u201d (Tr. 29.)

This accountant made it clear to him that he had an obligation to file his \nincome tax returns for tax years 2017 through 2019, even though his tax returns for tax \nyears 2014 through 2016 had not been filed. (Tr. 38-39.) With the assistance of this \naccountant, Applicant filed his federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2017 \nthrough 2020 in early March 2021. (AE B; Tr. 21, 25.) He requested IRS tax transcripts for \ntax years 2014 through 2016 under his social security number, but they did not show the \ninformation needed to file his tax returns for those tax years. (Tr. 22, 28.) \nAt his April 29, 2021 hearing, Applicant expressed his intention to request his tax \ntranscripts for tax years 2014 through 2016 under his employer identification number so \nthat he could file his delinquent tax returns. (Tr. 22, 28.) As of May 12, 2021, Applicant had \nrequested, but not yet received, the tax transcripts for those tax years. (AE C.) He intends \nto file his income tax returns on time in the future. (Tr. 23.) \nIn March 2021, Applicant began a repayment plan to address $5,719 in past-due \nstate sales and use taxes from his business. (Tr. 31.) After a May 3, 2021 payment of \n$169.25, his balance is $4,411. (AE D.) Applicant received a federal income tax refund of \n$1,241 and a state income tax refund of $62 for tax year 2020. (AE A; Tr. 26.) He does not \nbelieve that he owes any outstanding income taxes for tax years 2017 and 2018. (Tr. 27.) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \n \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \n \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has the burden of establishing sufficient mitigation to overcome the \nfinancial concerns raised by his noncompliance with such an important obligation of his \nU.S. citizenship as filing income-tax returns on time. One or more of the following \nconditions under AG \u00b6 20 may apply in whole or in part: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant did not file his federal and state income tax returns when they were due \nfor tax years 2014 through 2018, as alleged in the SOR. Although not alleged in the SOR \nand therefore not considered as a basis for potential disqualification but relevant in \nassessing reform, Applicant did not file his federal or state income tax returns on time for \ntax year 2019 as well. Guideline F security concerns are established when an individual \nfails to comply with his tax filing obligations, whether or not any taxes are owed. AG \u00b6 19(f), \n\u201cfailure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local income tax returns or \nfailure to pay annual federal, state, or local income tax as required,\u201d is established because \nof his failure to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for multiple consecutive \ntax years. \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under \nsuch circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the \nindividual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from a \nlegitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling service, \nand there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved or is under \ncontrol; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAs of the issuance of the SOR in February 2020, Applicant had not filed his federal \nor state income tax returns for tax years 2014 through 2018. His failure to comply with his \ntax-filing obligation is too repeated and too recent for mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(a). \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is also not established. Applicant\u2019s tax-filing problems were not caused \nby circumstances outside of his control. His tax returns were more complicated when he \nhad his own automotive repair business, but he procrastinated, first in hiring an accountant \nand then in not pressing the accountant to ensure that his delinquent returns were filed. He \nadmits that he was \u201cnot super diligent about pushing his accountant to do something.\u201d The \ndeath of the accountant in 2020 is an unforeseen circumstance, but it explains only the \nrecent delay in addressing his tax filing issues for tax years 2014 through 2016.

His fear \nof the consequences of having unfiled returns for tax years 2014 through 2016 were he to \nfile returns for the subsequent tax years is not a mitigating circumstance under AG \u00b6 20(b), \ngiven he sought no professional guidance about the tax-filing requirements, either from the \naccountant hired to prepare his returns for tax years 2013 through 2016, another tax \nprofessional, the IRS, or his state\u2019s tax authority. \nAGs \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and 20(g) have some applicability because Applicant filed his \ndelinquent federal and state income tax returns for tax years 2017 through 2019 when he \nfiled his income tax returns for 2020 in early March 2021. However, while he has also \ntasked his new accountant with handling his long past-due tax returns for 2014 through \n2016, those tax returns have not been filed as of the close of the evidentiary record. \nApplicant indicated on May 12, 2021, that he has requested the documentation required to \ncomplete those returns. It is unclear when those returns will be filed. \nEven where tax problems have been corrected and an applicant is motivated to \nprevent such problems in the future, the administrative judge is not precluded from \nconsidering an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness in light of longstanding prior behavior evidencing \nirresponsibility. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01984 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 2015). The Appeal \nBoard has long held that the failure to file tax returns suggests a problem with complying \nwith well-established government rules and systems. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-04437 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 15, 2016). Moreover, the Appeal Board has reaffirmed that the timing of \ncorrective action is an appropriate factor to consider in applying AG \u00b6 20(g). See e.g., ISCR \nCase No. 17-01382 at 4 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 17-01807 at 3-4 \n(App. Bd. Mar. 7, 2018)). In reversing favorable clearance grants to applicants with tax \nissues by DOHA judges in ISCR Case No. 17-01382 (App. Bd. May 16, 2018) and ISCR \nCase No. 16-01211 (App. Bd. May 30, 2018), the Appeal Board noted that applicants who \nonly begin to address their delinquent tax returns after having been placed on notice that \ntheir clearance may be in jeopardy may not comply with laws, rules, and regulations when \ntheir immediate interests are not imperiled. Applicant was on notice as of his January 2019 \nSF 86, and reminded during his May 2019 subject interview and in response to September \n2019 interrogatories, that his unfiled tax returns were an issue for his clearance eligibility. \nThere is no evidence that he took any steps at that time to file his income tax returns for \ntax years 2017 or 2018. The financial considerations security concerns raised by failure to \ntimely comply with his income-tax filing obligations are only partially mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Those factors are: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \n \nThe analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some \nof the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment. \nThe security clearance adjudication involves an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in light of the security guidelines in the Directive. \nSee ISCR Case No. 09-02160 (App. Bd. Jun. 21, 2010). It is understandable that Applicant \nfelt overwhelmed about preparing his own tax returns when he had a business. While he \nexhibited good judgment, albeit belatedly, in seeking the assistance of a tax professional in \n2015, that does not discharge him from his responsibility for thereafter ensuring that his \nincome tax returns were prepared and filed within a reasonable time. With the assistance \nof the accountant, he filed only his past-due tax returns for 2013. Applicant was placed on \nnotice by his January 2019 SF 86 and reminded during his May 2019 interview and in \nSeptember 2019 interrogatories that his tax matters were of concern, and yet he made no \neffort to rectify his tax filings at that time. Even after the SOR was issued, he allowed the \ntax-filing deadline for tax year 2019 to pass without complying with his filing obligations. \nWhile Applicant expressed a sincere intention to file his tax returns on time in the future, it \ndoes not carry as much weight in reform as if he had been able to show a track record of \ncompliance with his tax-filing obligations. \nThe Appeal Board has repeatedly held that the government need not wait until an \napplicant mishandles or fails to safeguard classified information before denying or revoking \nsecurity clearance eligibility. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 08-09918 (App. Bd. Oct. 29, 2009) \n(citing Adams v. Laird, 420 F.2d 230, 238-239 (D.C. Cir. 1969)). It is well settled that once \na concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, there is a strong \npresumption against the grant or renewal of a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, \n913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th Cir. 1990). Under Appeal Board precedent, an applicant who \nwaits to address tax issues until his or her immediate interests are at stake does not show \nsound judgment and reliability. His failure to give priority to such an important obligation as \nfiling tax returns required by law causes lingering doubts about his security worthiness that \nhave not been fully mitigated. \nFormal Finding \nFormal finding for or against Applicant on the allegation set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, is: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n_____________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant is 39 years old. He completed vocational school in 2003. He married in 2016 and has two children ages three and one. He has worked for the same employer, a federal contractor, since 2008. (Transcript (Tr.) 18-20) The SOR alleges five charged-off credit card debts totaling approximately $37,167. Applicant testified that he incurred the debts from about 2007 until 2015. In his July 2018 security clearance application (SCA), he disclosed that he filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in 2015 and stopped paying these accounts. He stated, \u201cI was in the middle of paying for a wedding and fell behind on mortgage payments. I filed Chapter 13, but then decided to pull a 401k loan and pay my outstanding debt to lenders.\u201d (GE 1) The bankruptcy was dismissed in September 2016 at his request. (Tr. 21-27; GE 5) In June 2016, Applicant took a loan for approximately $49,000 from his pension plan to be repaid over five years. He completed the repayment agreement in June 2021. (Tr. 53; AE A, B) In November 2018, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator.

The action was taken under Executive Order \n(EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) effective on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on February 22, 2020, and requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge. The case was assigned to me on July 2, 2021.

DOHA received the hearing \ntranscript on August 26, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted all of the allegations in the SOR. After a thorough and careful \nreview of the pleadings, testimony, and exhibits submitted, I make the following findings \nof fact. \nApplicant is 39 years old. He completed vocational school in 2003. He married in \n2016 and has two children ages three and one. He has worked for the same employer, a \nfederal contractor, since 2008. (Transcript (Tr.) 18-20) \nThe SOR alleges five charged-off credit card debts totaling approximately $37,167. \nApplicant testified that he incurred the debts from about 2007 until 2015. In his July 2018 \nsecurity clearance application (SCA), he disclosed that he filed Chapter 13 bankruptcy in \n2015 and stopped paying these accounts. He stated, \u201cI was in the middle of paying for a \nwedding and fell behind on mortgage payments. I filed Chapter 13, but then decided to \npull a 401k loan and pay my outstanding debt to lenders.\u201d (GE 1) The bankruptcy was \ndismissed in September 2016 at his request. (Tr. 21-27; GE 5) \nIn June 2016, Applicant took a loan for approximately $49,000 from his pension \nplan to be repaid over five years. He completed the repayment agreement in June 2021. \n(Tr. 53; AE A, B) \nIn November 2018, Applicant was interviewed by a government investigator. He \ntold the investigator that he stopped making mortgage payments in 2015 because he was \npaying bills for his upcoming wedding, credit cards, and regular bills. Applicant used the \ncredit cards alleged in the SOR to finance his wedding, vacation, and other things. The \nwedding cost approximately $26,000. He used approximately $28,000 of the loan to bring \nhis mortgage current and another $16,000 to pay other delinquent bills. He did not pay \nthe debts in the SOR because the creditors did not contact him. (Tr. 21-27, 33-35, 38-45; \nGE 1, 2) \nThe SOR alleges three delinquent accounts to the same creditor in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \n($11,578), 1.b ($11,106), and 1.c ($6,170). In his SCA, Applicant disclosed he had \ndelinquent accounts with this creditor in the total amount of $17,000 that were \u201ccharged \noff, suspended, or canceled for failing pay as agreed.\u201d In his SCA, he did not indicate how \nmany accounts he had with this creditor. (GE1) He indicated the accounts were opened \nin January 2014 and the financial issues were resolved in January 2016. Regarding the \ndescription of the action he had taken, he stated \u201cAccounts are closed.\u201d (GE 1) No other \ndelinquent debts were disclosed.

He had other delinquent \naccounts that he had stopped making payments on in 2015, and that he used the loan to \nrepay them. Regarding the three accounts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b and 1.c, he told the \ninvestigator that these accounts were in collection, and he had not received attempts from \nthe creditor to resolve them. He was aware the accounts were charged off and he did not \nplan on making any payment arrangements unless he received collection attempts from \nthe creditor. (Tr. 38-45; GE 2) \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted each debt and stated that he was \nwaiting for the creditors to offer him settlements. He testified that he fully intended to pay \nhis creditors, but was waiting for them to contact him. He took no action to pay or resolve \nthese debts in the previous five years. He said that he has about $6,500 remaining from \nhis pension loan that he could use to settle the debts if the creditors contact him. \nSubsequent to his answer, the creditor for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b and 1.c contacted \nhim and offered to settle the balance owed on all three debts ($28,856) for $8,652. \nApplicant paid the settlement in March 2020. (Tr. 20-27, 30-41; AE C, D) \nApplicant testified that he has not contacted the creditors for the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.d ($4,533) and 1.e ($3,780). Both debts became delinquent in 2015 and are charged \noff. They are listed on his July 2019 and August 2021 credit reports. He testified that he \nwanted to pay these creditors, and he may even call them after his hearing to settle. He \nsaid he has a budget, but it is not written, and his brother is helping him with his finances. \nHe had financial counseling when he filed for bankruptcy in 2016. (Tr. 34-36, 45-48, 54) \nAny derogatory information that was not alleged in the SOR will not be considered \nfor disqualifying purposes, but may be considered when applying the mitigating \nconditions, in a credibility determination, and a whole-person analysis. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative judge \nmust consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations for each guideline, \nthe adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information).  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG & 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides conditions that could raise security concerns. The following are \npotentially applicable: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had five accounts that became delinquent in 2015. He admitted that he \nowed the accounts and despite having the money to pay these debts, he chose not to \nunless the creditors contacted him. There is sufficient evidence to support the application \nof the above disqualifying conditions. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems began when he stopped making mortgage \npayments so he could finance his wedding, vacation, and other things. He took a loan \nfrom his pension plan to bring his mortgage current and pay other debts not alleged in the \nSOR. He chose not to pay the remaining debts unless the creditors contacted him. These \ndebts became delinquent in 2015. Applicant consciously reneged on his financial \nobligations. His behavior casts doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness and good \njudgment. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems resulted from his decision to finance his wedding \nand other expenses with credit cards, and then deciding he would not pay them unless \nthe creditors contacted him. This was within his control. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. There \nis some evidence that Applicant received financial counseling in 2016, but the evidence \nis insufficient to conclude his financial problems are being resolved. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not \napply. \nApplicant did not contact any of the creditors to resolve his delinquent debts. He \nhad the money to pay the debts, but stated he was waiting for them to contact him. After \nfive years, one creditor offered him a settlement on three debts, which Applicant paid. He \nhas not contacted the creditors on the two remaining debts. His actions do not constitute \na good-faith effort to repay his overdue creditors. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant has been aware for many years that he had delinquent accounts that he \nused to finance his wedding, vacation, and other expenses. He made the conscious \ndecision to not pay these debts unless the creditors contacted him. The government relies \non those holding security clearances to do the right thing and act responsibly. Applicant\u2019s \nlack of judgment and unwillingness to abide by fundamental rules raise security concerns. \nHe has not met his burden of persuasion. The record evidence leaves me with questions \nand doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For these \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreasons, I conclude Applicant failed to mitigate the security concerns arising under \nGuideline F, financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.d-1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is 37 years old, married, and has a young child. He graduated from high school in 2001 and earned an associate\u2019s degree in science in October 2011 from a technical institute (the Institute). He began working for a DoD subcontractor in April 2019 and was hired in August 2019 by the DoD contractor to work directly for it as a Test Technician. Both of these positions required that he have a security clearance. In March 2019, he submitted his SCA. He has not previously held a security clearance. (Tr. at 20- 21.)

After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, including Applicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer to all 11 of the SOR allegations, his testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant incurred 14 student loans to pay for his education. He paid the loans when they became due every month until 2016 or 2017. At that time, his wife was a full- time nursing student, and they were living solely on Applicant\u2019s income. The monthly payments due on his loans were more than he could afford, and he defaulted. All but two of his loans were owned by the U.S. Department of Education (DOE). Applicant also had two private student loans. The total debt incurred on the private loans was about $17,500. At the time of his background interview, Applicant estimated that the total amo",

The \nDefense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant on May 4, 2020, detailing \nsecurity concerns under Guideline F (Financial Considerations). The CAF acted under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (Feb. 20, \n1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DoD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (Jan. 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); \nand the adjudicative guidelines (AG) promulgated in Security Executive Agent Directive \n4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (Dec. 10, 2016), effective within the DoD on \nJune 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant answered the SOR in an undated document (Answer).

DOHA issued a notice \nof hearing on February 16, 2021, scheduling the hearing for March 12, 2021. \nI convened the hearing as scheduled. Department Counsel presented five \nproposed exhibits, marked as Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through 5.

After a thorough and careful review of \nthe pleadings, including Applicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer to all 11 of the SOR \nallegations, his testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record, I make the \nfollowing findings of fact. \nApplicant incurred 14 student loans to pay for his education. He paid the loans \nwhen they became due every month until 2016 or 2017. At that time, his wife was a full-\ntime nursing student, and they were living solely on Applicant\u2019s income. The monthly \npayments due on his loans were more than he could afford, and he defaulted. All but two \nof his loans were owned by the U.S. Department of Education (DOE). Applicant also had \ntwo private student loans. The total debt incurred on the private loans was about $17,500. \nAt the time of his background interview, Applicant estimated that the total amount of his \n14 student loans was about $58,000. (Tr. at 23-25; GE 2 at 3; GE 3 at 2-4; GE 4 at 2-3; \nGE 5 at 2-4.) \nIn January 2018, a DOE service provider obtained a garnishment of Applicant\u2019s \nincome. The garnishment amount was 20% of each of his paychecks and varied between \n$300 and $400 per pay period. Applicant was under the mistaken impression that the \ngarnishment extended to all of his student loans, including his private loans. In fact, the \ngarnishment only covered his DOE loans. In October 2019, Applicant entered into a \nrehabilitation payment plan with a second DOE service provider, which required him to \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmake monthly payments of $722 for nine months beginning in October 2019. He made \nall nine payments and successfully rehabilitated his 12 DOE loans. These loans are \ncurrently in good standing. Under the federal CARES Act enacted in 2020, his interest \nrate was temporarily reduced to 0%. He is currently paying $200 per paycheck on all of \nhis DOE student loans. His total DOE debt is about $33,000. (Tr. at 23, 25-30; GE 1 at \n45; GE 2 at 3, Answer at 1; AE E.) \nIn August 2020, Applicant began to take college courses part time at a local \nuniversity. He hopes to continue his education at a major state university. He wants to \npursue a bachelor\u2019s degree in electrical engineering so that he can qualify for a higher-\nlevel job and earn more income to support his family. He and his wife, who is now a \npracticing nurse at a cancer center, collectively earn a significant income, and he is paying \nfor his college courses out of their earnings without incurring any additional student-loan \ndebt. As a result of Applicant\u2019s current status as a part-time student, his obligation to \nrepay his DOE student loans has been deferred to August 2024. Applicant is committed \nto repaying the DOE loans so that he can maintain his much-improved credit score and \ndemonstrate his commitment to acting responsibly. He appreciates that any failure to do \nso could negatively affect any security clearance eligibility he may have in the future. (Tr. \nat 22, 27-28.) \nSOR Allegations \nSix of Applicant\u2019s 12 DOE student loans are alleged in the SOR at \u00b6 1.b ($9,266), \n\u00b61.c ($8,861), \u00b6 1.d ($6,620), \u00b6 1.e ($5,653), \u00b6 1.f ($4,397), and \u00b6 1.g ($4,332). The \nremaining six loans were not included in the SOR because they did not appear on his \ncredit reports. The total amount of the six alleged loans is about $39,000. The most recent \ncredit report in evidence, dated November 6, 2020, also reflects a total student loan debt \nof about $39,000. With Applicant\u2019s successful rehabilitation of these loans and their \npresent status as current and deferred, these debts are current. \nApplicant\u2019s two private delinquent student loan debts are alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a and \n\u00b6 1.h. The total amount of these debts is about $17,000. A third party filed a lawsuit \nagainst the private lender claiming that the debts were unenforceable due to violations of \nthe law by the lender. As a result of a successful resolution of this lawsuit, Applicant \nreceived a notice from the lender informing him that the debts were not enforceable and \nany payments of the debts would be returned to Applicant. Applicant testified that when \nhe learned that these debts were separate from the DOE loans, he made some payments \nbefore learning about the lawsuit. These debts have been resolved. (Tr. at 24-25; AE B \nat 1-9.) \nThe SOR lists three additional allegations of delinquent debts. They are: \nSOR 1.i \u2013 Collection Account Owed to a Lender in the Amount of $300. During a \nperiod when Applicant and his wife were living solely on his income, he took out several \nshort-term \u201cpay-day\u201d loans. He repaid each of these loans, except he overlooked this one \nloan. He was advised of this collection account during his background interview on July \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n10, 2019. He repaid this debt on June 8, 2020 and provided evidence of his payment at \nthe hearing. This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 30, 32-33; GE 3 at 10; AE E at 8.) \nSOR 1.j \u2013 Collection Account Owed to a Medical Provider in the Amount of $297. \nThis debt arose when Applicant had a tooth extracted. He thought he paid what he owed \nin addition to his insurance coverage at the time of the dental surgery. He never heard \nfurther from the surgeon. He was again advised of this collection account during his \nbackground interview. He called the holder of the debt and learned that he owed more \nthan the amount listed on his credit report. He paid the account in two amounts, one for \n$125 and a second of $504. He provided evidence of the payments at the hearing. This \ndebt is resolved. (Tr. at 30-31; GE 3 at 10; GE 4 at 1; GE 5 at 1; AE E at 9-10.) \nSOR 1.k \u2013 Collection Account Owed to a Medical Provider in the Amount of $61. \nThis debt was for a medical appointment. After the background investigator advised him \nof this collection account, he paid it in May 2020 and provided evidence of his payment \nat the hearing. This debt is resolved. (Tr. at 31; GE 3 at 11; GE 4 at 1; AE E at 11.) \nOverall, Applicant\u2019s finances are sound. Together, he and his wife make about \n$110,000 per year. Their rent is a modest $1,500 per month. He and his wife split the \nfamily bills between the two of them. He pays their rent, internet charges and cellphone \naccount. His wife keeps a separate bank account and pays the utility bills certain other \nmonthly expenses. He maintains a minimum balance of about $1,000 in his bank \naccount at all times. They each own a car and pay about $400 per month on their \nvehicle loans. The cars were purchased new in 2018. Applicant has one credit-card \naccount with a small credit limit. He uses the card to pay for gas, and he pays the card \nin full every month. He recently opened a new credit-card account with a higher credit \nlimit. He did this to improve his credit score. He puts aside three percent of his income \nin his employer\u2019s savings plan. The company matches his contributions. (Tr. at 33, 38-\n39; AE D at 4-9.) \nDue to their significant combined earnings and lack of tax deductions, Applicant \nand his wife ended 2019 with insufficient withholdings to pay all of their federal and \nstate income taxes that were due in 2020. They have entered into payment plans to pay \nthe balances due to the IRS and their state, which totals about $10,000, and Applicant\u2019s \nwife makes monthly payments on those tax debts. They have adjusted their withholding \namounts to avoid any underpayments in the future. These debts were not alleged in the \nSOR. (Tr. at 34-37.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527.

Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer and his testimony and the documentary \nevidence in the record establish the following disqualifying conditions under this guideline: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe guideline in AG \u00b6 20 contains seven conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties. Five of them have possible applicability to the \nfacts of this case: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is partially established. Applicant\u2019s debts are numerous and recent. His \nrecent actions, however, to address these debts support the conclusion that they are \nunlikely to recur and do not cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is partially established. Applicant\u2019s debts arose because of his wife\u2019s \ndecision to pursue full-time studies to become a nurse. She has successfully completed \nher student work and is now fully employed in the field of caring for cancer patients. While \nthese circumstances may not be considered outside of Applicant\u2019s control, it was \nultimately his wife\u2019s decision to forgo her pre-student employment and to study nursing \nfull-time. The result of her decision was that Applicant could no longer afford to pay his \nstudent loans. Once his wife finished her degree in nursing and became reemployed, \nApplicant has rehabilitated his DOE loans and is presently current on those loans. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is not established. The record contains no evidence that Applicant \nsought or received financial counseling. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is fully established. Applicant has paid the three collection debts alleged \nin the SOR and has rehabilitated the six DOE debts alleged. All of his DOE student loan \ndebts are in current status. His two other private student loans have been favorably \nresolved. Applicant has initiated and is adhering to a good-faith plan to repay formerly \noverdue debts to creditors. \nAG \u00b6 20(e) is fully established with respect to the two private student loans alleged \nin the SOR. While it was not Applicant who disputed the validity of these two debts, he \nhas established that they are unenforceable. Moreover, the documentary evidence in the \nrecord established that the creditor is not allowed to receive any payments from Applicant \neven if he attempted to pay these debts. \nApplicant defaulted on his sizable student loans during a period of limited income. \nSince then, his wife has become reemployed, and Applicant obtained a better-paying job. \nThe couple have recovered a solid financial footing and have responsibly addressed \nApplicant\u2019s student loans. In light of the record as a whole, Applicant satisfied his burden \nto establish mitigation of the security concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Analysis \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d), specifically: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the applicable \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions and evaluating all of the evidence in the context of \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his \nindebtedness. \nFormal Findings \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through1.k: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national interests of the United States \nto grant Applicant national security eligibility for a security clearance.

She has acted responsibly to resolve her financial \nproblems, which are unlikely to recur. Her request for continued access to classified \ninformation is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn November 18, 2018, Applicant submitted an Electronic Questionnaire for \nInvestigations Processing (e-QIP) to renew her eligibility for a security clearance required \nfor her employment with a federal contractor and for her military reserve duties. Based on \nthe results of the ensuing background investigation, Department of Defense (DOD) \nadjudicators could not determine that it is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have a security clearance, as required by Security Executive \nAgent Directive (SEAD) 4, Section E.4, and by DOD Directive 5220.6, as amended \n(Directive), Section 4.2. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn January 31, 2020, DOD issued to Applicant a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging facts that raise security concerns under the adjudicative guideline for financial \nconsiderations (Guideline F). The adjudicative guidelines (AG) cited in the SOR were \nissued by the Director of National Intelligence on December 10, 2016, to be effective for \nall adjudications on or after June 8, 2017. \nApplicant timely responded to the SOR (Answer) and requested a hearing before \nan administrative judge at the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA). I \nreceived the case on November 10, 2020, and convened the requested hearing on \nDecember 14, 2020. The parties appeared as scheduled, and DOHA received a transcript \nof the hearing (Tr.) on December 30, 2020. Applicant testified and presented Applicant \nExhibits (AX) A \u2013 D. Department Counsel proffered Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \u2013 6. With \nher Answer, Applicant provided documents that have been included in the record without \nobjection. (Tr. 12 \u2013 13) \nAdditionally, I left the record open after the hearing to allow Applicant to present \nadditional relevant information, On December 21, 2020, Applicant proffered AX E \u2013 L. \nThe record closed on December 28, 2020, when Department Counsel waived objection \nto admissibility of Applicant\u2019s post-hearings submissions. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline F, the Government alleged that Applicant owed $56,469 for 15 \ndelinquent or past-due debts (SOR 1.a \u2013 1.o). In response, Applicant admitted SOR 1.a, \n1.b, 1.g. 1.h, 1.j, and 1.m. She denied the remaining allegations, and all of her responses \nwere accompanied by explanatory remarks. (Answer) In addition to the facts established \nby Applicant\u2019s admissions, I make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is 39 years old. She and her ex-husband were married from November \n2005 until they separated in 2012. A divorce was finalized in June 2014. Applicant has \ntwo children by her ex-husband, now ages 19 and 15. Applicant\u2019s ex-husband served in \nthe military but was involuntarily discharged before they separated, resulting in a \nsignificant loss of household income. Applicant served on active duty in the military \nbetween June 1999 and June 2014, when she was involuntarily separated from the \nservice with an honorable discharge as part of a force manpower adjustment. (Answer; \nGX 1; GX 6; Tr. 7 \u2013 8, 38, 50 \u2013 51) \nSince June 2014, Applicant has served in a military reserve unit where she drills \nonce a month and performs two weeks on active duty annually. After she was involuntarily \nseparated in 2014, she could not find full-time civilian employment until August 2015. Her \nonly income consisted of her monthly reserve pay and whatever unemployment benefits \nshe may have been receiving. Since 2015, Applicant has worked for various civilian \nemployers. She also was unemployed between May 2017 and February 2018 after being \nfired; however, the record suggests that she was not terminated for misconduct, but \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbecause she and her manager were incompatible. Since February 2018, Applicant has \nbeen steadily employed by companies doing business with the federal government. She \nhas held a security clearance first granted while she was on active duty since at least \n2009. (GX 1; GX 5; Tr. 40, 42, 52 \u2013 56) \nIn Section 26 (Financial Record) of her most recent security clearance application, \nApplicant disclosed several delinquent or past-due debts. On March 18, 2019, she was \ninterviewed as part of her background investigation by a government agent, who reviewed \nwith her the contents of a credit bureau report (CBR) that reflected the debts alleged in \nthe SOR. Applicant asserted that her financial problems stemmed from the co-occurrence \nof the loss of income after her ex-husband\u2019s unplanned discharge; from her divorce, which \nresulted in a significant loss of income and additional expenses; and from her own \nunplanned separation from the active duty military. She reported during the interview that \nshe was working with a debt management company to consolidate and repay her past-\ndue debts. (GX 5; Tr. 86) \nAfter initially having custody of both children after her divorce, Applicant sent the \nolder child to live with her ex-husband because she could not afford to care for both \nchildren. She also was homeless at times, relying on various friends and relatives to allow \nher and her child to stay with them. The debts alleged at SOR 1.a and 1.d arose when \nApplicant became unable to pay her rent. Another rent-related debt (SOR 1.m) is the \nresult of fees assessed against her when she moved out of a different rental property. \n(Answer; GX 1; GX 2; GX 6; Tr. 38 \u2013 39, 56) \nAs she stated in her March 2019 subject interview, Applicant initially worked to \nresolve her financial problems through a debt management company. She paid as much \nas $700 each month for credit report corrections, general financial counseling, and most \nimportant, an organized repayment plan for her debts based on settlement negotiations \nwith her creditors. By the fall of 2019, she realized that no progress was being made in \npaying off her debts. In December 2019, Applicant started working with her current \nfinancial counselor, who has helped Applicant establish a monthly budget on which was \nbased a debt repayment plan that first addressed small and modest-sized debts she was \nable to repay quickly. In addition, Applicant and her financial counselor negotiated \nrepayment plans for several of her larger debts starting in late 2019 and early 2020. \nHowever, in December 2019, Applicant had a car accident in which she hit a deer, \nrendering her car a total loss. She subsequently incurred a $6,000 debt for the balance \nof her car loan that was not covered by insurance, and she had not purchased gap \ninsurance from the dealer who sold her the car. Applicant also incurred a debt for unpaid \ncar insurance premiums around the time of the accident. Neither debt was alleged in the \nSOR, but Department Counsel introduced information about the debts that is relevant to \nan examination of Applicant\u2019s actions in response to financial problems. Applicant has \nresolved the insurance debt and she is making $160 monthly payments to resolve the car \nloan balance due. (Answer; GX 2; GX 6; AX A; AX I; AX J; Tr. 72, 102 - 105) \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn response to the Government\u2019s information, Applicant showed she has paid or \notherwise resolved the debts at SOR 1.d \u2013 1.f, 1.j, 1.k, 1.l, and 1.o. She also is making \nmonthly payments or has established a payment plan to resolve the debts alleged at SOR \n1.i and 1.n. As to SOR 1.h, available information shows it is a duplicate of the debt alleged \nat SOR 1.i. This duplication resulted with the transfer of the debt from one collection \nagency to another. Applicant first incurred this debt when she took out a loan to pay for \nthe legal fees from her divorce. (Answer; GX 2; GX 4;  AX B; AX C; AX D; AX F; AX G; \nAX H; AX K; AX L; Tr. 43 \u2013 45, 73 \u2013 80, 88 \u2013 90) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nThe $12,904 debt at SOR 1.a arose when Applicant was evicted from an apartment \nfor non-payment of rent in August 2015. Applicant disputes the alleged amount due, \nclaiming she only was obligated to pay about $2,400, with the remainder consisting of \nfees and interest charged by collection agencies. Applicant testified that starting in 2019, \nshe paid about $100 each month but had to stop after her car accident. In May 2020, \nApplicant resumed monthly payments but stopped because of her dispute over the \nbalance due. (Answer; Tr. 15, 42 \u2013 43, 58 \u2013 67, 111) \nSOR 1.b alleges a debt that remains from a car loan obtained in 2012, when \nApplicant was still married and both she and her ex-husband were still on active duty. \nApplicant last made a payment on this account in March 2014. She has not taken further \naction to resolve this obligation, choosing instead to prioritize other, more recent and \nresolvable debts. (Answer; GX 2; Tr. 67 \u2013 72) \nApplicant also disputed that she owes the debt at SOR 1.c, which arose from \nalleged failure to return cable television equipment in 2015. Applicant testified that she \nreturned the equipment in 2015 to resolve this debt, but she has no receipt or other way \nto corroborate her claim. Instead, she relies on the fact that the debt has not appeared on \nany credit reports after September 2019. (Answer; GX 2 \u2013 4; GX 6; Tr. 72 \u2013 73) \nThe $16,595 debt alleged at SOR 1.g also was incurred during Applicant\u2019s \nmarriage. After her ex-husband was discharged and the couple lost a significant part of \ntheir income, Applicant obtained a credit union loan to consolidate their bills. However, \nshe was unable to stay current on the loan payments and it was charged off in February \n2013. She has not yet taken any action to resolve this debt. (Answer; GX 2; GX 5; Tr. 85 \n\u2013 87) \nThe $3,991 debt alleged at SOR 1.m represents charges for repairs and damage \nfrom an apartment where Applicant lived in 2015. Applicant claims she only owes about \n$800. A repayment plan in 2019 was unsuccessful because of the car accident discussed \nearlier. Applicant intends to re-establish a payment plan after the debt at SOR 1.i and the \ndebt resulting from her car accident are paid off. (Answer; GX 1 \u2013 3; AX I; Tr. 96 \u2013 97, \n111 \u2013 112) \n \nApplicant and her financial counselor have established an organized plan to pay \ndown Applicant\u2019s debts. The plan is incorporated into a monthly budget that will reallocate \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nmoney to SOR 1.a, 1.b, and 1.g that is currently assigned to pay the debts at SOR 1.i, \n1.j, and 1.n, as well as the aforementioned $6,000 balance due after her car accident. \nApplicant\u2019s income is sufficient to pay these debts; however, she has less than $200 \nremaining each month. Applicant\u2019s plan also considers, but does not rely on, a future \nincome increase from a pending job offer that would result in a net monthly cash flow of \nabout $1,500. (Answer; AX A; AX E; AX I; AX J; Tr. 36, 48, 71, 100 \u2013 110, 112 \u2013 114) \nPolicies \nEach security clearance decision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndetermination based on examination of all available relevant and material information, \nand consideration of the pertinent criteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG). (See Directive, 6.3) Decisions must also reflect consideration of the \nfactors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. Commonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d \nconcept, those factors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. A security clearance decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have \naccess to classified information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988)) \n5 \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke a security clearance for an \napplicant. Additionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged \nin the SOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, \nextenuate or mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a security \nclearance, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, \n531) A person who has access to classified information enters into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations  \nThe Government established that Applicant incurred numerous delinquent or past-\ndue debts between about 2013 and 2019. As of the close of the background investigation, \nmost of those debts had not been paid or otherwise resolved. This information reasonably \nraises a security concern about Applicant\u2019s finances that is articulated, in relevant part, at \nAG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nIn response to the Government\u2019s information, Applicant established that her debts \narose from the combined effects of her 2014 divorce after two years of separation, her \nex-husband\u2019s unplanned discharge from active duty before 2012, and her own \nunexpected separation from active duty in 2014. After finding consistent employment \nalmost four years later, Applicant started to address her debts through a debt \nmanagement company; however, she did not see results in that effort and, since late \n2019, she has been working with a financial counselor who has helped Applicant establish \nan organized, budget-conscious plan to pay down her debts. Although much of \nApplicant\u2019s effort to resolve her debts has occurred at or after the SOR date, it is also \nclear that she first tried to address her debts well before the SOR as she finally found \nsteady work. Unfortunately, her initial efforts were hindered by an ineffective debt \nmanagement company. She also was delayed in late 2019, when her car was totaled and \nshe incurred additional debt (not alleged in the SOR), which she has addressed in a timely \nfashion. Applicant has resolved or now is repaying most of her debts, and she has a plan \nto address the remaining larger debts. She meets all of her current obligations in addition \nto repaying her past-due debts. All of the foregoing supports application of the following \nAG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions: \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are not the result of poor financial judgment or other \nmisconduct. She has acted responsibly given the circumstances in which she found \nherself, and it is likely she will resolve her remaining debts. The security concerns under \nthis guideline are mitigated. I also have evaluated this record in the context of the whole-\nperson factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). In addition to Applicant\u2019s military service of more than \n20 years, her efforts to resolve her debts despite limited resources and unforeseen \nevents, speaks well of her judgment and reliability. A fair and commonsense assessment \nof all of the record as a whole shows the concerns raised in the SOR are mitigated. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.o: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the foregoing, it is clearly consistent with the interests of national \nsecurity for Applicant to have access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact I have incorporated Applicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer in my findings of fact and have noted therein his comments on the debts. Applicant\u2019s personal information is extracted from GE 2, his SCA, unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to the record. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, including all of the documents attached to Applicant\u2019s Answer, the Government\u2019s FORM, and the Government\u2019s documentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact. Applicant, 49, married in 2010 and separated in 2017. The couple divorced in November 2018. He has a nine-year-old child and a 17-year-old stepchild. He received a GED in 1991 and has been taking courses online on a part-time basis to earn certifications in technology fields. When Applicant was a teenager and a young man, he had some serious difficulties with the criminal justice system, which included a period of imprisonment.

Applicant defaulted on 15 financial obligations. He provided significant \nevidence in mitigation. Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nOn October 4, 2016, Applicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) \nseeking a clearance for the first time. On February 4, 2020, the Department of Defense \nConsolidated Adjudications Facility (DOD CAF) sent Applicant a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) alleging security concerns under Guideline F. The DOD CAF acted under \nExecutive Order 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, \n1960), as amended (Exec. Or.); DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines \n(December 10, 2016) (AG) effective for all adjudicative decisions on or after June 8, 2017. \nOn March 10, 2020, Applicant responded to the SOR and submitted over 150 \npages of supporting documentation (Answer).

In his Answer, he admitted each of the SOR \nallegations regarding his 15 delinquent debts. He also provided a detailed explanation of \nhow he became indebted and the steps he has taken to resolve his debts. \nOn April 15, 2020, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written case \nin a File of Relevant Material (FORM), including six documents identified as Items 1-6. \nThe FORM and the six attachments were provided to Applicant, which he received on \nJune 16, 2020. He was afforded an opportunity to file objections and to submit a written \nresponse and documents within 30 days of his receipt of the FORM. Applicant provided \nno response. \nBy not responding to the FORM, Applicant raised no objection to the admission of \nFORM Item 3, an unauthenticated report of investigation summarizing Applicant\u2019s April \n27, 2018 background interview. In his FORM, Department Counsel advised Applicant that \nhe had the right to object to the admissibility of this document as unauthenticated. \nDepartment Counsel also informed Applicant that he could provide corrections and \nupdates to the summary of his interview and that if he failed to object, he may be \ndetermined to have waived any objections he has to the admissibility of the interview \nsummary. Applicant did not object to the summary. I conclude that Applicant has waived \nany objections to the summary of his background interview. Accordingly, I have included \nthis document in the written record in this case. I have marked Items 1 through 6 attached \nto the FORM as Government Exhibits (GE) 1-6, respectively, and they are admitted \nwithout objection. The case was assigned to me on September 22, 2020. \nFindings of Fact \nI have incorporated Applicant\u2019s admissions in his Answer in my findings of fact and \nhave noted therein his comments on the debts. Applicant\u2019s personal information is \nextracted from GE 2, his SCA, unless otherwise indicated by a parenthetical citation to \nthe record. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings, including all of the \ndocuments attached to Applicant\u2019s Answer, the Government\u2019s FORM, and the \nGovernment\u2019s documentary evidence in the record, I make the following findings of fact. \nApplicant, 49, married in 2010 and separated in 2017. The couple divorced in \nNovember 2018. He has a nine-year-old child and a 17-year-old stepchild. He received a \nGED in 1991 and has been taking courses online on a part-time basis to earn certifications \nin technology fields. When Applicant was a teenager and a young man, he had some \nserious difficulties with the criminal justice system, which included a period of \nimprisonment. He has not repeated that behavior since about 2008 and has become a \nproductive member of society. (GE 1 at 8, 62; GE 3 at 2, 4-10.) \nIn October 2015, Applicant began to experience financial difficulties after losing his \njob. He found part-time employment in January 2016 and worked there until October \n2016, at which time he was hired to work in a full-time position. In February 2017, he was \nhired as an assembler by a U.S. Government contractor, which sponsored him for a \nsecurity clearance. (GE 1 at 4-8; GE 3 at 2-4, 11-12.) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant and his wife began living apart in March 2016. Divorce proceedings were \ncommenced in May 2017. In September 2017, his wife and their children precipitously \nmoved out of the family apartment, breaching the couple\u2019s lease on the apartment. Also, \nApplicant\u2019s mother died in April 2017, and he incurred part of the cost of her funeral. All \nof these setbacks caused Applicant\u2019s finances to suffer. The 15 debts alleged in the SOR \nbecame delinquent during the period 2015 through 2017. He regained his financial \nstability in 2017 after he began working for his clearance sponsor. In his Answer, \nApplicant wrote that he is current on all of his ongoing debts and financial responsibilities, \nincluding his child support. (GE 1 at 4-8; GE 3 at 2-4, 11-12; GE 5 at 2-3; GE 6 at 1-6.) \nIn March 2020, Applicant began working with a credit-counseling firm to \nconsolidate and manage his debts. He also received counseling from a credit union to \nhelp him resolve his debts. The 15 debts alleged in the SOR total approximately $33,460. \nIn his Answer, he wrote that he has settled and paid $10,284 of these debts, leaving a \nbalance of about $23,176. He attached to his Answer a number of documents evidencing \npayments of the following seven debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d ($3,191), 1.f ($2,234), 1.i \n($819), 1.j ($732), 1.m ($397), 1.n ($390), and 1.o ($1,955). His documentation showed \nthat he paid a total of $4,875 to settle these debts. All of these payments were made after \nthe date of the SOR in 2020. (GE 1 at 8, 9-19.) \nApplicant also provided two credit reports with notations that were made by a credit \ncounselor. These notations indicate that Applicant was \u201csettling\u201d the following five \nadditional debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b ($5,601), 1.e ($2,772), 1.g ($1,298), 1.h ($1,165), \nand 1.l ($438). The total of the alleged amounts of these debts is $11,274. A second credit \nreport provided by Applicant contains a notation that the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and \n1.g were \u201cSettled.\u201d The second credit report also notes that the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.h \nis \u201cSettling.\u201d Applicant provided no additional evidence to establish that he had settled the \ndebts set forth in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.g or to reflect what actions he had taken or was \nplanning to take to settle the three other debts in this group of debts. (GE 1 at 101-103, \n103-105, 107-108, 111-112, 115-116, 143-144, 151.) \nIn addition to the above, Applicant has admitted the three additional debts alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a ($6,373), 1.c ($5,564), and 1.k ($534). The first debt is the result of \nApplicant\u2019s former wife breaching her apartment lease. The Government\u2019s November 26, \n2019 credit report indicates that Applicant has disputed this debt. (GE 1 at 7; GE 6 at 1.) \nIn an April 12, 2017 court order in an action brought by his former wife\u2019s landlord, \nApplicant was ordered to pay an arrearage in their rent of $4,922 over a period of five \nmonths. Applicant paid the entire arrearage. A month after that debt was fully paid, \nApplicant\u2019s then-wife breached the lease by moving out of the apartment with their \nchildren. The lease did not expire until February 2018. Applicant was living elsewhere \nand was unaware of her actions. Her breach resulted in damages of $6,373 for five \nmonths of unpaid rent and other physical damage to the apartment. The court\u2019s divorce \ndecree ordered that Applicant and his former wife are both responsible for their debts \narising after the date of their separation, which included this debt. His wife failed to pay \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nher share of this debt. Applicant disputes that he owes more than his one-half share of \nthis debt. (GE 1 at 7, 62, 80.) \nApplicant\u2019s credit counselor noted on one of the credit reports that \u201cClient needs \nhelp\u201d with this debt. The other credit report notes that this debt was \u201cPaid Off Settled.\u201d \nThe record evidence is otherwise silent on the current status of this debt, the largest \nalleged in the SOR. (GE 1 at 7, 34-35, 108-109, 150; GE 6 at 1.) \nThe two remaining SOR debts are alleged in \u00b6\u00b6 1.c ($5,564) and 1.k ($534). The \ndebts alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c is listed on one of Applicant\u2019s credit reports with the notation \nthat \u201cClient needs help\u201d with this debt. His other credit report contains the notation \u201cDMP,\u201d \nwhich stands for \u201cDebt Management Plan.\u201d The record contains no additional evidence \nas to whether any payments were made under the terms of a plan arranged by the credit \ncounselor. This debt was the balance due on an auto installment loan. (GE 1 at 109-111, \n147; GE 6 at 3-4.) \nThe remaining debt, SOR \u00b6 1.k ($534) was a delinquent account owed to a \ncommunications company. A notation on one of Applicant\u2019s credit reports reflects this \naccount was \u201cSettled\u201d and a notation on his second credit report indicated that this \naccount was \u201cSettling.\u201d The record contains no additional evidence to support the notation \nthat the account was resolved. (GE 1 at 117-118, 151.) \nApplicant provided extensive documentation from his divorce proceeding to \ndemonstrate that he has acted responsibly in the handling of his family responsibilities, \neven in the middle of a contentious divorce. An order of the court, dated December 13, \n2019, established that Applicant had fully paid his child-support arrearage and was \ncurrent with his ongoing support obligation. (GE 1 at 28.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18 as follows: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. \nApplicant\u2019s admission in his SOR response and the documentary evidence in the \nrecord establish the following potentially disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \n\u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) and 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial \nobligations\u201d). \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \nAG \u00b6 20(e): the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy \nof the past-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides \ndocumented proof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides \nevidence of actions to resolve the issue. \n6 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is partially established. All of the debts arose in the last five years and \nbased upon the record evidence, some of the debts remain unresolved. The delinquent \ndebts are not infrequent. The circumstances under which they arose, however, support a \nconclusion that they are unlikely to recur. The combination of Applicant\u2019s unemployment \nand underemployment, and his separation and divorce, created an unusually difficult and \nfinancially stressful period in his life. His mother\u2019s death aggravated his financial \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nproblems. Now that Applicant has been employed working for a Government contractor, \nhe has responded to his situation with maturity and responsibility. He has settled several \ndebts and is in the process of settling the remaining debts. His financial problems do not \ncast doubt upon his current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nAG \u00b6 20(b) is fully established under the same rationale. Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems arose for reasons beyond his control, and he has acted responsibly under the \ncircumstances. Based upon the information available in the record, Applicant still has a \nnumber of outstanding debts. More current information on the state of Applicant\u2019s \nfinances might have been useful. On the other hand, he provided an extensive amount of \ndocumentation with his Answer demonstrating his steps to repay his debts and regain \nfinancial stability. I conclude that Applicant\u2019s prior responsible behavior supports a \nconclusion that he will continue to address his remaining debts and resolve them in a \nresponsible manner. \nIn support of this conclusion, I cite the Appeal Board\u2019s decision in ISCR Case No. \n07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) for the proposition that the adjudicative guidelines \ndo not require that an applicant be debt-free. The Board\u2019s guidance for adjudications in \ncases such as this is the following: \n. . . an applicant is not required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has \npaid off each and every debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an \napplicant demonstrate that he has established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and \nhis actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the \nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. There is \nno requirement that a plan provide for payments on all outstanding debts \nsimultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and concomitant conduct) may \nprovide for the payments of such debts one at a time. \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and quotation \nmarks omitted). When considering the entirety of Applicant\u2019s financial situation, I view \nApplicant\u2019s corrective action to be responsible and reasonable. Given his resources, he \nhas initiated a pragmatic approach to the repayment of his SOR debts and has taken \nsignificant steps to resolve those debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is fully established. Prior to the issuance of the SOR, Applicant hired a \nfinancial counselor, and received advice and assistance from legitimate and credible \nsources. The record evidence establishes that he has resolved about half of his debts \nand has sought help in resolving at least two of his other debts. As noted above, \nApplicant\u2019s responsible steps taken to date, including paying off about half of his debts \nand his hiring a credit-counseling firm and a credit union, constitute \u201cclear indications\u201d \nthat his financial problems are being resolved. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant has initiated an effort to resolve his debts. Applicant provided evidence \nthat after the issuance of the SOR, he began to repay about his debts. His evidence \nshowed that he paid seven of the 15 debts alleged in the SOR. The timing of his efforts, \nhowever, do not fully support a conclusion that the efforts satisfy the \u201cgood faith\u201d \nrequirement of this mitigating condition since he waited until he learned that his security \nclearance and livelihood was in jeopardy as a result of the issuance of the SOR. AG \u00b6 \n20(d) is partially established. \nApplicant disputes that he owes all of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a for rent \nfollowing his then-wife\u2019s breach of the lease on the family apartment. He has provided \nappropriate documentation supporting this dispute. AG \u00b6 20(e) only partially applies to \nthat debt, however. Applicant has every right to expect his former wife to pay her half of \nthe debt, especially since it was her irresponsible actions that gave rise to the debt. \nApplicant may be able to enforce that obligation in a post-divorce proceeding. He is, \nnevertheless, legally obligated to pay the former landlord the entire amount of the debt. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). These factors are: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity \nat the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent \nbehavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of \ncontinuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Some factors warrant additional \ncomments. Applicant is a mature individual, who experienced difficult financial \ncircumstances due to unemployment, underemployment, separation, divorce, and a \ndeath in his family. He responded to his financial problems in a responsible manner. His \nresponse is particularly impressive in light of his early history of criminal behavior and the \nmany positive steps he has taken as an adult to put that period in his life behind him. It is \nsignificant that prior to the issuance of the SOR, Applicant hired a financial counselor to \nadvise him on how to resolve his outstanding debts. Moreover, there is little likelihood \nthat Applicant\u2019s financial problems will recur. After weighing the disqualifying and \nmitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the evidence in the context of \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the security concerns raised by his \ndelinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1.

After a review of the pleadings and evidence, I make the \nfollowing additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 36-year-old employee of a federal contractor performing the duties \nof a uniform protection officer. He began working at his present job in June 2018. He also \nhas a second job in the nongovernment private sector. He earned his bachelor\u2019s degree \nin 2009. He has never married. He has one child, age 15, with whom he shares legal and \nphysical custody with the child\u2019s mother. (Tr. 6, 21-22, 24-26; GE 1, 3) \nThe SOR alleged eight delinquent accounts (student loans, car repossession, \ncredit cards, and consumer debts) totaling approximately $36,450. The debts are \nestablished by credit reports from July 2018, October 2019, and April 2020; Applicant\u2019s \npersonal subject interview (PSI) with a defense investigator in June 2019; and his SOR \nadmissions. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.h) (AE 2-5; Answer to SOR) \nApplicant explained that his financial difficulties were caused by trying to raise his \nchild while attending college, helping his mother with her bills, and short periods of \nunemployment between regular jobs. On February 11, 2021, Applicant entered into a five-\nmonth contract with a debt relief company (DRC) whereby the DRC would negotiate \nsettlements with his creditors and perform other actions to repair his credit. Applicant paid \n$4,000 for this service. At the end of five months (July 12, 2021), Applicant would need \nto execute a new contract with the DRC. It is unclear whether Applicant would have to \npay an additional $4,000 to have the DRC continue acting on his behalf. He was advised \nby the DRC to pay his smaller debts first then work his way up to the larger balances. (Tr. \n30-31; AE C) \nThe status of the SOR debts is as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a-$11,614. This debt resulted from a car repossession. Applicant opened \nthis loan in 2014, and in 2018 the car was repossessed for non-payment and a deficiency \nbalance accrued to him. He has not made any payments toward this debt. He is following \nthe DRC plan and waiting to pay smaller debts before he pays this one. This debt is \nunresolved. (Tr. 42-45; GE 3) \nSOR \u00b6 1.b-$9,117. Applicant opened this credit card in 2013 and it became \ndelinquent in 2015. He has not made any payments toward this debt.

Applicant incurred his \nstudent loans in approximately 2007 and they became delinquent in 2015. Up until his \nhearing, he had not contacted his loan servicing agency about trying to rehabilitate his \nloans. He was following the DRC\u2019s advice and waiting to deal with these debts after he \npaid some of his smaller debts. Post-hearing, Applicant contacted a company that will \nassist him in rehabilitating his student loans with him paying $5 a month beginning \nOctober 1, 2021. These debts are unresolved. (Tr. 45; GE 3; AE D) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f-$3,355. Applicant opened this credit card in 2015 and it became \ndelinquent in 2019. He documented two payments of $850 each settling this debt in May \n2021. He used the DRC\u2019s strategy to pay this debt. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 32-37, 39; \nGE 4; AE B) \nSOR \u00b6 1.h-$456. Applicant opened this credit card in 2008 and it became \ndelinquent in 2017. He documented a payment of $214 settling this debt in April 2021. He \nused the DRC\u2019s strategy to pay this debt. This debt is resolved. (Tr. 37-38; GE 4; AE B) \nApplicant paid a non-SOR debt in the amount of $351 in May 2021. (Tr. 40-41; AE \nB) \nApplicant testified that he is paying all his current financial obligations. Based upon \nbudget information he gave during his testimony, his monthly residual after paying all \nexpenses is approximately $500. Other than hiring the DRC (during his testimony, \nApplicant sometimes referred to the DRC as a \u201claw firm\u201d), there is no evidence that \nApplicant received any financial counseling. He claimed that all his federal and state tax \nreturns were filed and any taxes owed were paid. (Tr. 50-57, 60-61) \nApplicant provided two letters from work supervisors who have worked with him \nsince 2018. They described Applicant as honest, forthcoming, dependable, and \nresponsible. (AE A) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred multiple delinquent debts including student loans, of which all \nbut two remain unpaid or unresolved. I find both disqualifying conditions are raised. \nAlthough President Biden extended a pause on the collection of student loans due \nto COVID-19, thus creating a deferment period on student-loan payments \n(https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/01/20/pausing\u00ad\nstudent-loan-payments/), that action does not excuse previously delinquent student \nloans. (See ISCR Case No. 20-01527 at 2 (App. Bd. June 7, 2021)) \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent because they are ongoing and, although he recently \npaid two smaller debts after the SOR was issued, he has chosen not to address his larger \ndebts because the DRC he hired recommended this action. He failed to produce evidence \nshowing that recurrence of his financial problems is unlikely.

His track record to date does not support a good financial picture. \nAdditionally, he failed to put forth a good-faith effort to resolve his debts. His two largest \nconsumer debts remain unaddressed and he only initiated efforts to rehabilitate his \ndelinquent student loans after the hearing. Unfortunately, his actions are too little, too late. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are not under control. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and AG 20(d) do not \napply, except to SOR debts \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.h. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s difficulties in raising a young child while attending college, \nfinancially assisting his mother, working two jobs, paying a non-SOR debt, and the \ncircumstances surrounding his indebtedness. However, I also considered that he has \nmade insufficient efforts to resolve his debts. He has not established a meaningful track \nrecord of debt management, which causes me to question his ability to resolve his debts. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns.

Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted his security clearance application (SCA) on May 9, 2018. On \nFebruary 6, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) sent him a Statement of Reasons (SOR) alleging security \nconcerns under Guidelines J, G, and E. The CAF acted under Executive Order (EO) \n10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as \namended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel \nSecurity Clearance Review Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the \nadjudicative guidelines (AG) implemented by the DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR on March 12, 2020, and requested a decision based \non the written record in lieu of a hearing. On June 25, 2020, the Government sent \nApplicant a complete copy of its written case, a file of relevant material (FORM), including \npleadings and evidentiary documents identified as Items 1 through 4. He was given an \nopportunity to submit a documentary response setting forth objections, rebuttal, \nextenuation, mitigation, or explanation to the Government\u2019s evidence.

Applicant noted a \ncorrection to his name in the FORM which I appended to the record as Administrative \nExhibit I. The case was assigned to me on September 22, 2020. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant, age 32, is divorced with one minor child. He received a high school \ndiploma in 2006. He has been employed as an avionics technician by a defense \ncontractor since May 2018. Applicant previously held a security clearance while serving \non active duty with the U.S. Marine Corps from October 2007 until September 2017, when \nhe was discharged under other than honorable conditions. (Item 2) \nIn 2012, Applicant drove to a friend\u2019s house after a 24-hour work shift to help his \nfriend with yard work. After completing the yard work, Applicant watched television for a \ntime and then left to go home. During his drive home, he fell asleep at the wheel and hit \na neighbor\u2019s truck. He attributed the incident to his lack of sleep. He was charged with \nreckless driving \u2013 wanton disregard. A court found him guilty of the charge. (Item 1; Item \n3 at 7). \nIn 2014, Applicant consumed four mixed drinks over four and one-half hours while \nat a restaurant with coworkers. He then drove back to base. Because he smelled of \nalcohol when he presented his identification at the gate, he was administered a field \nsobriety test, which he failed. He was also administered a breathalyzer, which registered \na .14 blood alcohol count (BAC). He attributed the incident to poor judgment and \nintoxication. He received a Non-Judicial Punishment (NJP) for Drunken or Reckless \nOperation of Vehicle (Article 111) under Article 15 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice \n(UCMJ). The NJP resulted in a reduction in rank, forfeiture of $2,426, 45 days of restriction \nand extra duty. Applicant\u2019s driver\u2019s license was suspended for six months, and he was \nordered to take alcohol-education courses. (Item 1; Item 2 at 21-22, 33-34; Item 3 at 5-6, \n8) \n \nIn 2017, Applicant consumed six beers while at a few bars by himself. While \nwalking outside one of the bars, two men unknown to Applicant approached him and \nasked if he wanted to go to a party. Applicant agreed and entered their car, which was \nparked in the parking lot outside of the bar. The men offered Applicant cocaine, which he \naccepted. He felt sick after consuming the cocaine and immediately exited the car to \nvomit. He then walked back to his car, which had been parked in the same parking lot. \nHe decided to sleep in his car until morning, and then he drove home for the weekend. \nWhen he returned to work the following Monday, he was subjected to a random drug \nscreening. He tested positive for cocaine. He attributed the incident to being intoxicated. \nHe received an NJP for Wrongful Use of a Controlled Substance (Article 112a) under \nArticle 15 of the UCMJ. The NJP resulted in a reduction in rank, forfeiture of $2,534, and \n45 days of restriction and extra duty. He was subsequently discharged from the U.S. \nMarine Corps under other than honorable conditions for this misconduct.

He went outside of the bar to retrieve a pack of cigarettes \nfrom his car and decided to leave to go home. While driving home, an officer stopped him \nfor failure to maintain his lane. After refusing to take a field sobriety test, he was arrested \nand transported to the police station. While at the station, he was administered a \nbreathalyzer, which registered a .17 BAC. He was then charged with Driving Under the \nInfluence (DUI) and spent two days in jail. He self-reported the incident to his employer \nthe day following his release from jail. The charge was scheduled for disposition in April \n2019, which was not pronounced in the record. (Item 1; Item 3 at 12) \nThere is no mention in the record of the specific day that Applicant\u2019s December \n2018 DUI occurred. Applicant was interviewed on December 4, 2018 (Interview #1) and \nDecember 12, 2018 (Interview #2) in connection with the background investigation of his \nsecurity clearance application. He did not discuss his December 2018 DUI during \nInterviews #1 and #2. In April 2019, he was interviewed specifically to discuss the \nDecember 2018 DUI. There is neither an indication in the record nor any allegation that \nhe intentionally omitted the December 2018 DUI during Interviews #1 and #2. (Item 3) \nApplicant first consumed alcohol in 2008 at age 20. Because it made him sick the \nfirst time, he did not consume it again until his 21st birthday. From ages 21 through 25, \nhe consumed approximately six beers once per week. From age 25 through September \n2017, he consumed approximately 12 beers two times per week. From September 2017 \nthrough at least December 2018, he consumed six beers two times per week. Applicant \nadmitted that he consumed alcohol to intoxication twice per month between age 21 and \nDecember 2018. He defined intoxication as slurred speech and stumbling. He estimated \nthat it takes approximately eight beers for him to become intoxicated. Applicant does not \nfeel that he has a problem with alcohol. He has not had any alcohol counseling or \ntreatment. He has no intent to drive under the influence in the future. (Item 3 at 8, 12) \nApplicant acknowledged that his 2017 cocaine use was \u201cwrong and stupid\u201d and \nvowed never to use it or any other illegal drugs again. He asserted that he used cocaine \nonly once, but admitted that he used marijuana two times in 2006. He has no intent to \nuse any illegal drugs in the future because of the negative effect it had on his military \ncareer, his life, and prospective employment opportunities. (Item 2 at 35-36; Item 3 at 8) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988)). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d (Egan at 527). \nThe President has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant \napplicants eligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 2). \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (EO 10865 \u00a7 \n7). Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant has \nnot met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531). \u201cSubstantial \nevidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d (See v. Washington \nMetro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994)). The guidelines presume a \nnexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria listed \ntherein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. (ISCR Case No. 92-1106 at 3, 1993 WL \n545051 at *3 (App. Bd. Oct. 7, 1993)). Once the Government establishes a disqualifying \ncondition by substantial evidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate the facts. (Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15). An applicant has the burden of \nproving a mitigating condition, and the burden of disproving it never shifts to the \nGovernment. (ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)). \n  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d (ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002)). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; AG \u00b6 2(b)). \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline J (Criminal Conduct) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: Criminal activity creates \ndoubt about a person's judgment, reliability, and trustworthiness. By its very nature, it \ncalls into question a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and \nregulations. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe offenses alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: \n5 \nAG \u00b6 31(a): a pattern of minor offenses, any one of which on its own would \nbe unlikely to affect a national security eligibility decision, but which in \ncombination cast doubt on the individual's judgment, reliability, or \ntrustworthiness; \nAG \u00b6 31(b): evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted; and \nAG \u00b6 31 (e): discharge or dismissal from the Armed Forces for reasons less \nthan \"Honorable.\" \nNeither of the following relevant mitigating conditions under this guideline are \nestablished: \nAG \u00b6 32(a): so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior \nhappened, or it happened under such unusual circumstances, that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 32(d): there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not \nlimited to, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, \nrestitution, compliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or \nhigher education, good employment record, or constructive community \ninvolvement. \n \nApplicant\u2019s criminal activity demonstrates a pattern of questionable judgment that \nalso casts doubt on his ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nThe 2012, 2014, and 2017 offenses were particularly egregious since they occurred while \nhe served in the Marine Corps and possessed a security clearance. The fact that his 2018 \nDUI took place at all is problematic, but its timing further exacerbates the concern. \nWhether the 2018 DUI occurred after either Interview #1 or #2 is relevant to the \ndiscussion, but was not addressed in the record. However, the fact that the December \n2018 DUI occurred not only after Applicant was discharged from the Marine Corps for \nmisconduct, but also after he submitted his May 2018 SCA is significant. Applicant\u2019s SCA \nstatements expressing remorse about his drug use, particularly in light of its impact on \nhis career and life appeared sincere. The fact that he drove a vehicle after excessively \nconsuming alcohol for a second time following his SCA submission suggests that he is \neither unwilling or unable to modify his behavior. In light of the facts and circumstances \nof Applicant\u2019s criminal misconduct, there has not been a sufficient passage of time without \nincident to demonstrate reform. Moreover, I am unable to conclude that Applicant\u2019s \nunderlying questionable judgment is not likely to recur.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nGuideline G (Alcohol Consumption) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 21: Excessive alcohol \nconsumption often leads to the exercise of questionable judgment or the failure to control \nimpulses, and can raise questions about an individual's reliability and trustworthiness. \nApplicant\u2019s excessive alcohol consumption, resulting in the incidents alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.e, establishes the following disqualifying conditions under this \nguideline: \nAG \u00b6 22(a): alcohol-related incidents away from work, such as driving while \nunder the influence, fighting, child or spouse abuse, disturbing the peace, \nor other incidents of concern, regardless of the frequency of the individual's \nalcohol use or whether the individual has been diagnosed with alcohol use \ndisorder; and \nAG \u00b6 22(c): habitual or binge consumption of alcohol to the point of impaired \njudgment, regardless of whether the individual is diagnosed with alcohol \nuse disorder. \nNeither of the following relevant mitigating conditions under this guideline are \nestablished: \nAG \u00b6 23(a): so much time has passed, or the behavior was so infrequent, \nor it happened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur \nor does not cast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, \nor judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 23(b): the individual acknowledges his or her pattern of maladaptive \nalcohol use, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, \nand has demonstrated a clear and established pattern of modified \nconsumption \nor \nabstinence \nin \naccordance \nwith \ntreatment \nrecommendations. \nThe incidents alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b, 1.c, and 1.e collectively raise questions about \nApplicant\u2019s good judgment, reliability and trustworthiness. Incorporating my comments \nunder Guideline J, I find that Applicant has not demonstrated a sufficient pattern of \nmodified behavior for me to conclude that his excessive consumption of alcohol and \nquestionable judgment are behind him. \nGuideline E (Personal Conduct) \nThe security concern under this guideline, as set out in AG \u00b6 15, includes: \u201cConduct \ninvolving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations can raise questions about an individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNone of the listed disqualifying conditions under Guideline E strictly applies to \nApplicant\u2019s misconduct given my adverse determinations under Guidelines J and G. \nHowever, the facts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e establish the general concerns \ninvolving Applicant\u2019s questionable judgment and unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations. \nIncorporating my comments under Guidelines J and G, the security concerns \nraised under this guideline have not been mitigated by the following relevant mitigating \ncondition: \nAG \u00b6 17(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nadjudicative guidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole \nperson. In evaluating the relevance of an individual\u2019s conduct, an administrative judge \nshould consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines J, G, and E in my whole-\nperson analysis, and considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under Guidelines J, G, and E, and evaluating all the evidence \nin the context of the whole person, I conclude that Applicant has not mitigated security \nconcerns raised by a pattern of offenses involving his excessive alcohol consumption, \nand criminal and personal misconduct. Accordingly, Applicant has not carried his burden \nof showing that it is clearly consistent with the national interest to grant him eligibility for \naccess to classified information. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by Section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline G: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant  \nParagraph 3, Guideline E:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 3.a: \nAgainst Applicant  \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant eligibility for access to classified information.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact The SOR alleges that, as of February 6, 2020, Applicant owed two debts in collection for $13,846 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and $5,089 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); a charged-off debt of $9,431 (SOR \u00b6 1.c); and a $13,247 debt that was past due 90 days or more in the amount of $1,167 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). (Item 1.) When he responded to the SOR allegations, Applicant admitted the debts, but explained that he was paying on them monthly until his now ex-wife told him that she had drained their bank account, and that they were several months behind on the rent for their lot. Circumstances involving his then wife (a gambling problem and a drunk-driving offense) and other family members (a father with dementia) led Applicant to relocate where he landed a job making half of his previous income. He asserted that he was told to ignore the debts in the SOR by an online debt consolidation company. He claimed without any corroborating documentation that he paid off some other debts.

The DCSA CAF \ntook the action under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of Defense (DOD) Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative Guidelines (AG) \neffective June 8, 2017, applicable to all adjudications for national security eligibility or \neligibility to hold a sensitive position. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOn December 18, 2020, Applicant responded to the SOR allegations and requested \na decision on the written record in lieu of a hearing before a Defense Office of Hearings \nand Appeals (DOHA) administrative judge. On February 19, 2021, the Government \nsubmitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM) consisting of five Items, which included the \nSOR as Item 1 and his SOR response as Item 2. DOHA forwarded a copy of the FORM to \nApplicant on January 28, 2021, and instructed him that any response was due within 30 \ndays of receipt. Applicant received the FORM on February 2, 2021. No response was \nreceived by the March 4, 2021 deadline. \nOn May 4, 2021, the case was assigned to me to determine whether it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security clearance \nfor Applicant. I received the case file on May 7, 2021. \nEvidentiary Rulings \nDepartment Counsel submitted as Item 4 in the FORM a summary report of a \npersonal subject interview (PSI) of Applicant conducted on April 19, 2019, by an authorized \ninvestigator for the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). The summary report was \nincluded in a DOD report of investigation (ROI) in Applicant\u2019s case. Under \u00b6 E3.1.20 of the \nDirective, a DOD personal background ROI may be received in evidence and considered \nwith an authenticating witness, provided it is otherwise admissible under the Federal Rules \nof Evidence. The summary report did not bear the authentication required for admissibility \nunder \u00b6 E3.1.20. \nIn ISCR Case No. 16-03126 decided on January 24, 2018, the DOHA Appeal Board \nheld that it was not error for an administrative judge to admit and consider a summary of a \nPSI where the applicant was placed on notice of his or her opportunity to object to \nconsideration of the summary; the applicant filed no objection to it; and there is no \nindication that the summary contained inaccurate information. In this case, Applicant was \nprovided a copy of the FORM and advised of his opportunity to submit objections or \nmaterial that he wanted the administrative judge to consider. In the FORM, Applicant\u2019s \nattention was directed to the following notice regarding Item 4: \nIMPORTANT NOTICE TO APPLICANT: The attached summary of your \nPersonal Subject Interview (PSI) (Item 4) is being provided to the \nAdministrative Judge for consideration as part of the record evidence in this \ncase. In your response to this FORM, you can comment on whether [the] PSI \nsummary accurately reflects the information you provided to the authorized \nOPM investigator and you may make any corrections, additions, deletions, \nand updates necessary to make the summary clear and accurate. \nAlternatively, you may object on the ground that the report is unauthenticated \nby a Government witness and the document may not be considered as \nevidence. If no objections are raised in your response to this FORM, or if you \ndo not respond to this FORM, the Administrative Judge may determine that \nyou have waived any objections to the admissibility of the summary and may \nconsider the summary as evidence in your case. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nConcerning whether Applicant understood the meaning of authentication or the legal \nconsequences of waiver, Applicant\u2019s pro se status does not confer any due process rights \nor protections beyond those afforded him if he was represented by legal counsel. Pro se \napplicants are not expected to act like lawyers, but they are expected to take timely and \nreasonable steps to protect their rights under the Directive. ISCR Case No. 12-10810 at 2 \n(App. Bd. Jul. 12, 2016). See ADP Case No. 17-03252 (App. Bd. Aug. 13, 2018) (holding \nthat it was reasonable for the administrative judge to conclude that any objection had been \nwaived by an applicant\u2019s failure to object after being notified of the right to object). \nApplicant was advised in \u00b6 E3.1.4 of the Directive that he may request a hearing. In \n\u00b6 E3.1.15, he was advised that he is responsible for presenting evidence to rebut, explain, \nor mitigate facts admitted by him or proven by Department Counsel and that he has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision. While the \nDirective does not specifically provide for a waiver of the authentication requirement, \nApplicant was placed on sufficient notice of his opportunity to object to the admissibility of \nthe interview summary report, to comment on the interview summary, and to make any \ncorrections, deletions, or updates to the information in the report. Applicant did not object \nto the FORM or indicate that the PSI summary contained inaccurate information. \nFurthermore, Government officials are entitled to a presumption of regularity in the \ndischarge of their official responsibilities. See e.g., ISCR Case No. 15-07539 (App. Bd. \nOct. 18, 2018), and there is nothing in the record to indicate the PSI contains information \nthat was inaccurate or contrary to what Applicant reported. \nApplicant can reasonably be held to have read the PSI summary, and there is no \nevidence that he failed to understand his obligation to file any objections to the summary if \nhe did not want the administrative judge to consider it. Accordingly, I find that Applicant \nwaived any objections to the PSI summary. Item 4 is accepted into the record as an exhibit, \nsubject to issues of relevance and materiality in light of the entire record. \nFindings of Fact \nThe SOR alleges that, as of February 6, 2020, Applicant owed two debts in \ncollection for $13,846 (SOR \u00b6 1.a) and $5,089 (SOR \u00b6 1.b); a charged-off debt of $9,431 \n(SOR \u00b6 1.c); and a $13,247 debt that was past due 90 days or more in the amount of \n$1,167 (SOR \u00b6 1.d).

After considering the FORM, \nconsisting of the pleadings (Items 1 and 2) and Government exhibits (Items 3-5), I make \nthe following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 54-year-old high school graduate employed as a truck driver by a \ndefense contractor since December 2018. Twice married and divorced, he has a 28-year-\nold son and a 26-year-old daughter from his first marriage, which ended in July 2012 after \n23 years. (Item 3.) \nApplicant worked as a material handler for a large pharmaceutical manufacturer \nfrom April 2009 to March 2018. He and his first wife began having marital difficulties, and in \nJune 2010 he left the family home and moved in with his second wife, whom he married in \nMarch 2013. (Item 3.) \nWhile Applicant was working on third shift, his second wife apparently developed a \ngambling problem, drained their bank account, and fell several months behind in paying the \nrent for their lot. With funds borrowed from his sister, Applicant brought his accounts \ncurrent only for his second wife to again deplete their checking account due to her \ngambling. In March 2018, Applicant resigned from his longtime job with the pharmaceutical \ncompany to prepare for a planned relocation to care for his father, who had been \ndiagnosed with dementia. Applicant supported himself on his savings for a few months. In \nMay 2018, Applicant relocated to his current area and moved in with his parents. He was \nunemployed until June 2018, when he began working as a material handler at half of his \nprevious income. (Items 2-3.) He struggled to pay his bills because of the drastic reduction \nin his income after he moved to assist his parents, and he fell behind on some accounts. \n(Items 3-5.) \nAfter Applicant relocated to his parents\u2019 home, he and his then wife were separated \nuntil December 2018, when she joined him in their new locale. While living separately from \nApplicant for five months, she continued to gamble. Applicant assumed the move would be \ngood for her because there were no casinos nearby. (Item 2.) In December 2018, Applicant \nstarted working for his current employer, but his wife began gambling on cruise ships. It led \nto marital discord and divorce, which was final in November 2019. (Item 2.) \nOn April 4, 2019, Applicant completed a Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF 86). In response to financial record inquiries concerning delinquency \ninvolving routine accounts, Applicant listed three delinquent debts, reportedly credit-card \ndebts, for $13,248, $5,089, and $9,432, and explained that, after moving to help care for \nhis father, he earned less than half his previous income, and so he had difficulty paying his \nbills. He reported that he was currently utilizing the services of \u201can organization online that \nhad an A+ rating with the Better Business Bureau\u201d to help get his debt balances to zero. \nHe added with respect to the three delinquent accounts listed on his SF 86 that he was \nfollowing the directions of the credit-counseling organization.

It was \nreportedly past due 90 days for $1,167 (SOR \u00b6 1.d). The credit-card account with a \ncollection balance of $5,089 (SOR \u00b6 1.b) was opened in February 1999 and rated current \nuntil September 2018. The credit-card account with a charged-off balance of $9,431 (SOR \n\u00b6 1.c) was opened in May 2011 and charged off in March 2019 after seven months of no \npayments. Additionally, his credit report reflected a previously undisclosed delinquency with \na credit union. A credit-card account (SOR \u00b6 1.a) opened in January 2013 was current until \nSeptember 2018. It was placed for collection in February 2019 and was past due for \n$13,846 as of March 2019. His credit report reflected that he was making timely payments \nof $544 per month on a loan for a motorcycle obtained in September 2018 for $30,908. \nThe loan balance was $26,342 as of March 2019. Applicant owed no other outstanding \ndebt. He had paid off a $29,923 vehicle loan in May 2018. He was listed as an authorized \nuser on a credit-card account opened in November 2003. The account was current with a \n$227 balance. (Item 5.) \nOn April 19, 2019, Applicant was interviewed by an authorized investigator for the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM) about the delinquent debts on his credit record. \nHe admitted the debts, but explained that he had made timely payments before he moved. \nThe accounts became delinquent due to his lower income after his relocation. He asserted \nthat he had made a recent payment in January or February 2019 on his signature loan with \na credit union, which he initially correctly identified as the account having a $13,247 \nbalance, although he later confused that account with his $13,846 credit-card debt with the \nsame credit union (SOR \u00b6 1.a). (Item 4.) \nConcerning efforts to resolve his debts, Applicant stated without any corroborating \nevidence that he made payments when he could. Applicant indicated that he contacted an \nonline debt consolidation company to resolve his delinquent debts in lieu of resorting to \nbankruptcy and that he was paying the company \u201c$394 or $364 each month\u201d for \napproximately the past eight to ten months. He added that he was struggling to make his \n$400 monthly payment on the signature loan each month and that he planned to contact \nthe credit union about possibly lowering his monthly payment. Applicant stated he had not \nreceived any financial counseling. He was given the opportunity to provide documentation \nabout his financial delinquencies and his debt consolidation plan. The OPM investigator \nreceived no documentation from Applicant in that regard. (Item 4.) \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted the four alleged delinquencies. He \nexplained that his second wife had gambled away the money in their checking account; \nthat she had been jailed and served probation for a second drunk-driving offense before \nthey moved; that when he relocated, his income was less than half of his prior income; that \nwhile he paid off some bills, the debt consolidation company with whom he was working \ntold him \u201cto let go\u201d of the accounts listed in the SOR; and that after his wife joined him in \nDecember 2018, she gambled at a casino cruise ship. He related that divorce papers were \nfiled by August 2018, and his divorce was final in November 2018. (Item 2.)

His latest address of record is different from the address listed on his SF 86, \nwhere he was residing with his parents and apparently contributing to the expenses of his \nparents\u2019 residence. (Item 4.) It is unclear when he moved and whether he pays rent or a \nmortgage at his current address. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Section 7 of EO 10865 \nprovides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section \n3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are articulated in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness \nto abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or \nsensitive information. Financial distress can also be caused or exacerbated \nby, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of personnel security \nconcern such as excessive gambling, mental health conditions, substance \nmisuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial considerations \nsecurity concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) (citation omitted) \nas follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money in satisfaction of \nhis or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the totality of an \napplicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge must consider \npertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nqualities essential to protecting the national secrets as well as the \nvulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive presumes a \nnexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines and an \napplicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s April 2019 credit report (Item 5) shows that he stopped paying on the \naccounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c in September 2018, while his signature loan account (SOR \u00b6 \n1.d) was 90 days past due as of February 2019. As of April 2019, his unpaid delinquencies \ntotaled $29,533. His past-due debts establish the security concerns set forth in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations.\u201d \nThe evidence is conflicting with respect to the applicability of AG \u00b6 19(b), \u201cunwillingness to \nsatisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so.\u201d In lieu of filing for bankruptcy, Applicant \nhad sought the assistance of a debt consolidation company through which he planned to \npay his debts. During his April 19, 2019 interview, Applicant stated that he had been paying \nthe debt consolidation company \u201c$394 or $364 per month\u201d for the past eight to ten months. \nHis efforts to obtain the assistance of a debt consolidation company show a willingness to \npay his debts. However, the lack of any documented progress toward resolving the debts in \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nthe SOR, when coupled with his December 2020 explanation for \u201cthe ones in this \npaperwork\u201d (presumably the SOR debts) that \u201c[he] was told to let go\u201d by the debt \nconsolidation company, raises some doubts as to his present intention with regard to \nresolving the debts of concern to the DOD. AG \u00b6 19(b) applies. \nApplication of the aforesaid disqualifying conditions triggers consideration of the \nmitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20. Four of the seven mitigating conditions could apply in \nwhole or in part. They are: \n(a) The behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) cannot reasonably apply because Applicant defaulted on the accounts in \nthe SOR not so long ago and because the delinquencies are ongoing. The Appeal Board \nhas repeatedly held that unresolved debts indicate a continuing course of conduct. See \ne.g., ISCR Case No. 17-03146 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 31, 2018) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-\n08779 at 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 3, 2017)). \n \n \nApplicant has a case for some mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b) in that his recent \nfinancial struggles were caused by a significant loss of income after he moved to help care \nfor his father in May 2018. He indicated that the best job he could obtain was at half of his \nprevious income. Although it was Applicant\u2019s decision to leave his longtime job and \nrelocate, his father\u2019s dementia, and, for that matter, his second wife\u2019s gambling problem, \nwere circumstances outside of his control. \n \n \nFor AG \u00b6 20(b) to fully apply in mitigation, Applicant is required to have acted \nresponsibly. In that regard, he is credited for having sought the assistance of a debt \nconsolidation company before he completed his April 2019 SF 86 and was placed on \nnotice that his delinquencies could present a security concern. However, that mitigating \nevidence is undermined by the lack of any documented progress toward resolving any of \nthe SOR debts in the last two years. He stated during his OPM interview that he had made \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \na payment toward the signature loan in January or February 2019. He provided no \ncorroboration for that claimed payment. He is expected to present documentary evidence \nsupporting claims of debt payments, settlement, or other resolution. In the Government\u2019s \nFORM, Applicant was alerted to the importance of written documentation showing some \ngood-faith efforts to address the security concerns raised by his outstanding delinquencies. \nThere is no indication that Applicant submitted any documentation by the March 4, 2021 \ndeadline for his response. A component of responsible financial management is whether \nApplicant maintained contact with his creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments \nto keep debts current. He represented that he paid the debt consolidation company to take \nsuch actions on his behalf. Even so, the record is largely silent on what the debt \nconsolidation firm accomplished with respect to the SOR debts, if anything. If the company \nadvised him to let the debts go, as he now avers, he did not exercise sound financial \njudgment by relying on such financial advice knowing that the debts remain of concern to \nthe DOD. Furthermore, neither AG \u00b6 20(c) nor AG \u00b6 20(d) are satisfied without evidence of \nsome progress toward debt resolution or reasonable justification for why payments have \nnot been made. The concerns about his financial judgment have not been adequately \nmitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nIn assessing the whole person, the administrative judge must consider the totality of \nApplicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative process \nfactors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Those factors are: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances \nsurrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable participation; (3) the \nfrequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at \nthe time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; (6) \nthe presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, \ncoercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nThe analysis under Guideline F is incorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some \nof the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment. \nA security clearance adjudication is not a proceeding aimed at collecting an \napplicant\u2019s personal debts. Rather, it involves an evaluation of an applicant\u2019s judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. See ISCR Case No. 14-03991 at 2 (App. Bd. Jul. 17, 2015). \nApplicant having requested a decision on the written record, it was incumbent on him to \npresent sufficient mitigating information to enable a reasonable finding that his financial \nsituation presents an acceptable security risk. Not enough is known about Applicant\u2019s \ncurrent finances, including his income, expenses, and any savings. It is difficult to make an \nassessment as to whether he has the assets to resolve his financial delinquencies in the \nnear future. Moreover, some doubt exists about his commitment to address the matters of \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nsecurity concern. Applicant\u2019s April 2019 credit shows that he obtained a $30,908 vehicle \nloan with a motorcycle manufacturer in September 2018. The evidence shows that when \nhe took on that loan and its repayment obligation of $544 per month, he stopped paying on \nthe credit-card accounts in the SOR. It appears that he may have put his personal interest \nahead of his obligation to his existing creditors. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or renewal of a security \nclearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F.2d 1399, 1401 (9th  Cir. 1990). For the reasons \ndiscussed above, I have lingering concerns about Applicant\u2019s judgment, trustworthiness, \nand reliability. \nFormal Findings \nFormal Findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security clearance. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \nElizabeth M. Matchinski \nAdministrative Judge \n10 \n",

(Item 1) In her October 23, 2018 SCA, she said she \nowed $13,000 to the federal government for income taxes starting in 2014. (Item 3 at 30) \nShe said that she started a $100 monthly payment plan, and \u201cwill be making \narrangements to resume payments.\u201d (Id. at 31) She owed $4,500 in state income taxes \nstarting in 2014, and she planned to pay the debt when her house is sold.

(Item 4 at 7) She planned to file her tax returns and pay \nall of her taxes upon the sale of her house and the settlement of her mother\u2019s estate.

She did not indicate the \nsource of the funds to pay these debts; however, the funds presumably came from the \nsale of her house. \nSOR \u00b6 1.e alleges a charged-off mortgage debt for $42,907.

(Item 1) \nIn her October 23, 2018 SCA, Applicant said she owed the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.f \n($7,000), the financial issue began in January 2015, and monthly withholdings were \npending. (Item 3 at 34; Item 4 at 7) She said she owed the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.o ($1,200), \nthe financial issue began in January 2015, and she met with a lawyer to discuss her \noptions.

Thus, some of these three debts \nmay be included in her SOR. Her intention for the three debts was to meet with a lawyer \nto discuss her options. In her SCA, she also disclosed a home loan for $10,000 that \nbecame delinquent in December 2017, and she intended to sell her home to resolve this \ndebt.

These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.    \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; \u201c(c) a history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations\u201d; and \u201c(f) failure to file . . . or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or \nlocal income tax as required.\u201d \nIn ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, 2010), the Appeal Board \nexplained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n(internal citation omitted).

Discussion of the disqualifying conditions is contained in the \nmitigation section, infra. \nThe financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are as follows: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts;   \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue; \n(f) the affluence resulted from a legal source of income; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of mitigating \nconditions as follows:  \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.

However, \u201c[e]ven if \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in part, due to circumstances \noutside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider whether Applicant has since \nacted in a reasonable manner when dealing with those financial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case \nNo. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd.

A \ndebt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can \napplicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, \ncan be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR \nCase No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 \n(App. Bd.

The Fair Credit Reporting Act \nrequires removal of most negative financial items from a credit report seven years from \nthe first date of delinquency or the debt becoming collection barred because of a state \nstatute of limitations, whichever is longer. See Title 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c. See Federal Trade \nCommission website, Summary of Fair Credit Reporting Act Updates at Section 605, \nhttps://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0111-fair-credit-reporting-act.pdf. Debts may \nbe dropped from a credit report upon dispute when creditors believe the debt is not going \nto be paid, a creditor fails to timely respond to a credit reporting company\u2019s request for \ninformation, or when the debt has been charged off. \nApplicant did not describe any financial counseling. She did not provide \ndocumentary evidence showing she was not responsible for any of the 11 unresolved \nSOR debts.

A willful failure \nto timely make (means complete and file with the IRS) a federal income tax return is a \nmisdemeanor-level federal criminal offense. Title 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7203, willful failure to file \nreturn, supply information, or pay tax, reads: \nAny person . . . required by this title or by regulations made under authority \nthereof to make a return, keep any records, or supply any information, who \nwillfully fails to . . .  make such return, keep such records, or supply such \ninformation, at the time or times required by law or regulations, shall, in \naddition to other penalties provided by law, be guilty of a misdemeanor . . . . \nA willful failure to make return, keep records, or supply information when required, \nis a misdemeanor without regard to the existence of any tax liability. Spies v. United \nStates, 317 U.S. 492 (1943); United States v. Walker, 479 F.2d 407 (9th  Cir. 1973); United \nStates v. McCabe, 416 F.2d 957 (7th  Cir. 1969); O\u2019Brien v. United States, 51 F.2d 193 (7th  \nCir. 1931). For purposes of this decision, I am not weighing Applicant\u2019s failure to timely \nfile her federal income tax returns against her as crimes. In regard to the failure to timely \nfile federal income tax returns, the DOHA Appeal Board has commented: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, 2002). As we \nhave noted in the past, a clearance adjudication is not directed at collecting \ndebts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. Bd. Jul. 22, 2008). By \nthe same token, neither is it directed toward inducing an applicant to file tax \nreturns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s \njudgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to fulfill his or her \nlegal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment \nand reliability required of those granted access to classified information. \nSee, e.g., ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). See \nCafeteria & Restaurant Workers Union Local 473 v. McElroy, 284 F.2d 173, \n183 (D.C. Cir. 1960), aff\u2019d, 367 U.S. 886 (1961). \nISCR Case No. 14-04437 at 3 (App. Bd.

The Appeal Board \nclarified that even in instances where an \u201c[a]pplicant has purportedly corrected [his or her] \nfederal tax problem, and the fact that [applicant] is now motivated to prevent such \nproblems in the future, does not preclude careful consideration of [a]pplicant\u2019s security \nworthiness in light of [his or her] longstanding prior behavior evidencing irresponsibility\u201d \nincluding a failure to timely file federal income tax returns.

In ISCR Case No. \n15-1031 (App. Bd.

He received federal tax refunds of at least $1,000 for each \nyear. Nevertheless, the Appeal Board reversed the Administrative Judge\u2019s decision to \ngrant access to classified information. \nIn ISCR Case No. 15-06440 at 4 (App. Bd. Dec. 26, 2017) the Appeal Board \nreversed the grant of a security clearance, discussed how AG \u00b6 20(g) applied, and noted: \nThe timing of the resolution of financial problems is an important factor in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s case for mitigation because an applicant who \nbegins to resolve financial problems only after being placed on notice that \nhis clearance was in jeopardy may lack the judgment and self-discipline to \nfollow rules and regulations over time or when there is no immediate threat \nto his own interests. In this case, Applicant\u2019s filing of his Federal income tax \nreturns for 2009-2014 after submitting his SCA, undergoing his background \ninterview, or receiving the SOR undercuts the weight such remedial action \nmight otherwise merit. \nIn this case, Applicant provided some important evidence of mitigation under AG \n\u00b6 20(g) because she paid her delinquent federal and state tax bills for tax year 2014 of \nover $20,000. However, there is insufficient evidence showing Applicant\u2019s multiple \nfailures to timely file her tax returns were prudent good-faith decisions. She did not \nestablish she was unable to make greater progress sooner filing her federal and state \nincome tax returns for tax years 2015 through 2018. Under the Appeal Board\u2019s \njurisprudence, Applicant failed to establish mitigation of financial considerations security \nconcerns raised by her noncompliance with her tax-filing obligations and her ongoing \ndelinquencies totaling $40,962. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n     \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept.

Taking action to resolve the delinquent tax filings well after the \ninitiation of the security clearance process undercuts a determination that \nthose actions constitute a good-faith effort to resolve the delinquencies. Id. \nat 5. \nApplicant has not established that she filed her federal and state income tax \nreturns for tax years 2015 through 2018. She may not have fully understood or \nappreciated the importance of this requirement in the context of her eligibility for access \nto classified information. Even after receipt of the FORM, she did not provide evidence \nthat she filed these overdue tax returns. She did not establish she was unable to make \ngreater progress sooner in the resolution of her tax issues. Her actions under the Appeal \nBoard jurisprudence are too little, too late to fully mitigate security concerns. See ISCR \nCase No. 15-03481 at 5 (App. Bd. Sept. 27, 2016). Applicant\u2019s failure to timely file her tax \nreturns \u201cmay indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by \nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about [her] reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.\u201d AG \u00b6 18. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, \nExec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the \nfacts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Unmitigated financial \nconsiderations security concerns lead me to conclude that grant of a security clearance \nto Applicant is not warranted at this time. \n12 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a and 1.b:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f, 1.g and 1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.i: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.j through 1.o: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.p and 1.q:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.r and 1.s: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances in this case, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

On April 16, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and \nSecurity Agency (DCSA) Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement \nof Reasons (SOR) to her, under Executive Order (Exec.

The SOR recommended referral to an \nadministrative judge to determine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, \ndenied, or revoked. \nIn an unsworn statement, dated May 23, 2020, followed up by a sworn \nstatement, dated May 27, 2020, Applicant responded to the SOR, and she requested a \nhearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the Government \nwas prepared to proceed on November 1, 2020. The case was assigned to me on \nNovember 16, 2020. A Notice of Hearing was issued on November 24, 2020, \nscheduling the hearing for December 11, 2020. However, on the scheduled date, an \nissue arose associated with COVID-19, and the hearing had to be postponed. Another \nNotice of Hearing was issued on January 6, 2021. I convened the hearing as scheduled \non January 15, 2021. \nDuring the hearing, Government Exhibits (GE) 1 through GE 8, Applicant Exhibits \n(AE) A through AE E, and Administrative Exhibit I were admitted into evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on January 27, 2021. I \nkept the record open until February 16, 2021, to enable her to supplement it. She took \nadvantage of that opportunity and timely submitted additional documents which were \nmarked and admitted as AE F through AE J without objection. The record closed on \nFebruary 16, 2021. \nRulings on Procedure \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take Administrative Notice of certain \nenumerated facts pertaining to both the Russian Federation (Russia), appearing in \nextracts of 23 U.S. Government publications, including 13 press releases, and the \nDemocratic Republic of Georgia (Georgia), appearing in extracts of 4 U.S. Government \npublications. Facts are proper for Administrative Notice when they are easily verifiable \nby an authorized source and relevant and material to the case. \nAdministrative or official notice is the appropriate type of notice used for \nadministrative proceedings. See ISCR Case No. 05-11292 at 4 n.1 (App. Bd. Apr. 12, \n2007); ISCR Case No. 02-24875 at 2 (App. Bd. Oct. 12, 2006) (citing ISCR Case No. \n02-18668 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 10, 2004)); McLeod v. Immigration and Naturalization \nService, 802 F.2d 89, 93 n.4 (3d Cir. 1986)). The most common basis for administrative \nnotice at ISCR proceedings, is to notice facts that are either well known or from \ngovernment reports. See Stein, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW, Section 25.01 (Bender & Co. \n2006) (listing 15 types of facts for administrative notice). Requests for administrative \nnotice may utilize authoritative information or sources from the internet. See, e.g. \nHamdan v. Rumsfeld, 126 S.Ct. 2749 (2006) (citing internet sources for numerous \ndocuments). In this instance, although Department Counsel has selected only certain \nfacts appearing in the identified publications, I have not limited myself to only those \nfacts, but have considered the publications in their entirety. \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe 13 press releases of the U.S. Department of Justice were presented \napparently to substantiate that Russia actively pursues collection of U.S. economic and \npropriety information, and therefore, Applicant\u2019s relationship with family members in \nRussia raises suspicion of her. None of the cases in the press releases involve \nApplicant personally or involved espionage through any familial relationship. There is no \nindication of any government sponsorship, approval, or involvement encouraging any \nattempt to acquire sensitive commercial information for competitive advantage. \nLikewise, there is no evidence that Russia\u2019s government was involved in, or sanctioned, \nthe criminal activity. Moreover, the criminal wrongdoing of other U.S. citizens is of \ndecreased relevance to an assessment of Applicant\u2019s security suitability, especially \nwhere there is no evidence that Applicant, nor any member of her family, was ever \ninvolved in any aspect of the cases or ever targeted by any Russian intelligence official. \nAfter weighing the reliability of the source documentation and assessing the \nrelevancy and materiality of the facts proposed by the Government, pursuant to Rule \n201, Federal Rules of Evidence, I take administrative notice of certain facts, as set forth \nbelow under the Russia and Georgia subsections. However, while I do not reject the \nfacts set forth in the 13 press releases issued by the U.S. Department of Justice, any \ninference that Applicant or her family participated in criminal activity was not argued by \nthe Government and is specifically rejected. \nFindings of Fact \nIn her Answers to the SOR, Applicant admitted, with comments, two of the \nfactual allegations pertaining to foreign influence (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d. and 1.f.) as well as one \nof the factual allegations, with comments, pertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6 \n2.a.). Applicant\u2019s admissions and comments are incorporated herein as findings of fact. \nAfter a complete and thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due \nconsideration of same, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 47-year-old Russian-born naturalized U.S. citizen.

A 1991 high school graduate, her Russian educational pursuits \nwere subsequently evaluated as the equivalence of a bachelor\u2019s degree in education \nand a master\u2019s degree in English. She has never served with the U.S. military or any \nother military. She has never held a security clearance. She was married in 1991 and \ndivorced in 1995. She remarried in 2009 and was divorced in 2014. She remarried in \n2015 and was divorced in 2020.

Both of her parents were born in \nRussia. She never met or had a relationship with her father, does not actually know his \nname, and according to her mother, he abandoned her when he found out she was \npregnant. (AE E; Tr. at 30) Applicant was raised by her unmarried single mother (a \nretired industrial worker) who is now a septuagenarian, a Russian citizen temporarily \nresiding in Russia, but the holder of a U.S. Permanent Resident Card (Green Card), that \nallows her to reside and work permanently in the United States, at least until the card \nexpires in 2026. (AE D; Tr. at 31, 37) She resided in the United States for nearly one \nyear before returning to Russia in 2017, essentially because she and Applicant\u2019s most \nrecent ex-husband did not get along, and it is her intention to return to the United States \nonce the COVID-19 restrictions are lifted. (Tr. at 63-67, 99) While residing in Russia, \nshe has received the Russian equivalent of American Social Security (Tr. at 97-98) and \nshe resides in her own apartment, reportedly worth about $17,530. \nApplicant has one Russian-born son, a naturalized U.S. citizen who is currently a \nlance corporal with the U.S. Marine Corps. (AE F; Tr. at 56, 95) His Georgian-born wife \nis also the holder of a Green Card, and she is a housewife residing in the United States. \n(AE E; Tr. at 93-94) \nApplicant also has two cousins, both of whom are Russian citizen-residents. One \ncousin is a housewife and stay-at-home mother, and Applicant communicates with her \nmonthly by Internet phone. (GE 2, at 14; Tr. at 96-97) She does not know what her \nother cousin does for a living. They generally communicate during Christmas. (GE 2, at \n15; Tr. at 57-58, 96-97) \nApplicant\u2019s most recent ex-husband was a citizen of Georgia whom she met \nusing an on-line dating service. He was naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 2016. (AE B) \nBefore she married him and he came to the United States, he served with the Georgia \nMilitary Forces and later with the Georgia Security Police guarding various physical \nstructures. (Tr. at 47-49) His father is a Georgian-born (actually Soviet Union, when \nGeorgia was part of the Soviet Union) citizen-resident who previously worked for the \nSoviet Union\u2019s Committee for State Security (KGB) until the dissolution of the Soviet \nUnion in 1990, and then he transferred to the Georgia Security Police. He also held a \nGreen Card, and resided in the United States for about a decade, working as a janitor, \nbefore returning to Georgia. (Tr. at 51-53) Her ex-husband also had a mother, aunts, \ncousins, and other extended family members who are citizen-residents of Georgia. \nApplicant had limited communications with her ex-husband\u2019s family, with her most \nrecent communication with her ex-father-in-law occurring in 2017, and with some of the \nother family members taking place in April 2019, when she informed them that she and \nher husband were divorcing. (AE E; Tr. at 30, 54) She has no further relationship or \ncommunications with any member of her ex-husband\u2019s family. (Tr. at 54-55) \nBefore she moved to the United States, Applicant recalled the hypocrisy she had \nto endure when she was a child. She remembered a geography home assignment when \nshe had to quote Lenin, and when she worked as a journalist, she was forced to write \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsomething that she did not believe. She chose to seek a future in the United States, a \nplace that is better than any other country in the world. She enjoys the true democracy \nso people can pursue happiness free from oppression. (Tr. at 38) \nAlthough Applicant became a naturalized U.S. citizen in August 2013, she has \ncompleted no formal action under Russian law to renounce her Russian citizenship, and \nthus, she remains a dual citizen. Although she took certain steps in 2016 to do so, after \nsubmitting certain required documentation, and then being asked for additional \ndocumentation, she cancelled the process by failing to complete it, deciding that as a \nU.S. citizen, she has no further obligations to deal with Russia. (GE 2, at 4; Tr. at 43-44) \nOn December 13, 2017, when she was interviewed by an investigator from the U.S. \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM), Applicant said she was willing to renounce her \nRussian citizenship if necessary because she no longer has any connections to Russia. \n(GE 2, at 5) \nWhen she became naturalized as a U.S. citizen, she took an oath of allegiance to \nthe United States.  That oath is as follows: \nI hereby declare, on oath, that I absolutely and entirely renounce and \nabjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince, potentate, state, or \nsovereignty, of whom or which I have heretofore been a subject or citizen; \nthat I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United \nStates of America against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will \nbear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I will bear arms on behalf \nof the United States when required by the law; that I will perform \nnoncombatant service in the Armed Forces of the United States when \nrequired by the law; that I will perform work of national importance under \ncivilian direction when required by the law; and that I take this obligation \nfreely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; so help me \nGod.  \nhttps://www.uscis.gov/us-citizenship/naturalization-test/naturalization-oath-allegiance-\nunited-states-america \nNo member of Applicant\u2019s family, referring to her mother, son, or cousins, as \nopposed to her ex-husband and his father, has a past or current relationship with the \nRussian or Georgian governments, military, or intelligence services. (GE 2, at 14-15; \nGE 1, at 30) \nRussia \nRussia is composed of 21 republics. The Government consists of a strong \npresident, a prime minister, a bicameral legislature, and a weak judiciary often subject \nto political manipulation. It is a vast and diverse country with a population of 142 million \npeople.

There are numerous reports of human rights abuses, including law \nenforcement personnel engaged in torture, abuse, and violence to coerce confessions \nfrom suspects, with little accountability, despite the fact that the law prohibits such \npractices; widespread corruption within the police force; arbitrary arrest and detention; \npolitically motivated arrests; abductions; and life threatening prison conditions. The \nmedia is largely state-controlled. There are restrictions on freedom of movement within \nthe country, and all adults must carry government-issued internal passports while \ntraveling internally, and they are required to register with the local authorities within a \nspecified time of their arrival at a new location. \nRussia\u2019s two main intelligence services are the Russian Foreign Intelligence \nService (SVR) and the main Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff (GRU), both \noverseen by the Russian National Security Council and coordinated through the \nPermanent Interbranch Commissions of the National Security. Its intelligence capability \nis significant and focuses on collection of information from the United States. The Soviet \nUnion engaged in a series of high profile espionage missions against the United States, \nand Russia has continued the tradition. Russia is one of the two most aggressive \ncollectors of sensitive and protected U.S. technology and accounts for the majority of \nsuch targeting. Russia also provides technologies which could be used in the \nconstruction of weapons of mass destruction and missiles to other countries. It is a \nleading arms exporter, with major sales of advanced weapons and military-related \ntechnology to China, India, Iran, and Venezuela. Nevertheless, the United States and \nRussia share common interests on a broad range of issues, including counterterrorism \nand the drastic reduction of strategic arsenals. \nThe National Counterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC) reported that \nforeign economic and industrial espionage against the United States continues to \nrepresent a significant threat to the United States\u2019 prosperity, security, and competitive \nadvantage and identified Russia as one of the three most capable and active cyber \nactors tied to economic espionage and the potential theft of U.S. trade secrets and \nproprietary information. It reported that Russia uses cyber operations as an instrument \nof intelligence collection to inform its decision-making and benefit its economic interests, \nand that Russian intelligence services have conducted sophisticated and large-scale \nhacking operations to collect sensitive U.S. business and technology information. \nThe NCSC noted that, \u201c[a]n aggressive and capable collector of sensitive U.S. \ntechnologies, Russia uses cyberspace as one of many methods for obtaining the \nnecessary know-how and technology to grown and modernize its economy.\u201d Other \nmethods of collection include use of Russian commercial and academic enterprises that \ninteract with the West; recruitment of Russian immigrants with advanced technical skills \nby the Russian intelligence services; and Russian intelligence penetration of public and \nprivate enterprises, which enable the Russian government to obtain sensitive technical \ninformation from industry. \nThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) issued its Worldwide \nThreat Assessment of the U.S. Intelligence Community, in which it assessed that \n6 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nRussia will employ a variety of aggressive tactics to bolster its standing as a great \npower, weaken the United States, and undermine Euro-Atlantic unity; and that Russia \nwill use a range of relatively low-cost tools to advance its foreign policy objectives, \nincluding influence campaigns, economic coercion, cyber operations, and measured \nmilitary force. The ODNI also assessed that President Putin will likely increase his use \nof repression and intimidation to contend with domestic discontent over corruption, poor \nsocial services, and a sluggish economy; he will continue to manipulate the media and \nis likely to expand the Russian government\u2019s legal basis for repression; and Russia will \ncontinue to modernize, develop, and field a wide range of advanced nuclear, \nconventional, and asymmetric capabilities to balance its perception of a strategic \nmilitary inferiority vis-a-vis the United States. Russia will also seek to maintain, and \nwhere possible, expand its influence through the former Soviet countries that it asserts \nare in its self-described sphere of influence. \nThe ODNI has reported that areas of highest interest to foreign intelligence \ncollectors include energy/alternative energy; biotechnology; defense technology; \nenvironmental protection; high-end manufacturing; and information and communications \ntechnology. Over the years, the U.S. Department of Justice indicted a variety of U.S. \ncitizens and foreign nationals on charges related to computer hacking and conspiring to \nengage in economic espionage and theft of trade secrets. \nThe ODNI has also reported that Russian efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. \npresidential election represent the most recent expression of Russia\u2019s long-standing \ndesire to undermine the U.S.-led liberal democratic order and noted that \u201cthese activities \ndemonstrated a significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort \ncompared to previous operations.\u201d The 2016 influence campaign reflected Russia\u2019s \nrecognition of the worldwide effects that mass disclosure of U.S. Government and other \nprivate data have achieved in recent years. The ODNI assessed that Russian \nintelligence services will continue to develop capabilities to provide President Putin with \noptions to use against the United States. \nThe U.S. Department of State Travel Advisory for Russia is Level 4 \u2013 \u201cdo not \ntravel,\u201d due to COVID-19, terrorism, harassment, and the arbitrary enforcement of local \nlaws. The advisory directs U.S. citizens not to travel to the North Caucasus, including \nChechnya and Mount Elbrus, due to terrorism and civil unrest; or to Crimea due to \nRussia\u2019s occupation of the Ukrainian territory and abuses by its occupying authorities. \nTerrorist groups continue plotting possible attacks in Russia, and may attack with little \nor no warning. U.S. citizens have been arbitrarily interrogated or detained by Russian \nofficials and may become victims of harassment, mistreatment, and extortion. Due to \nthe Russian government-imposed reduction on U.S. diplomatic personnel in Russia, the \nU.S. Government has reduced ability to provide services to U.S. citizens. \nThe Department of State has assessed Moscow as being a high-threat location \nfor terrorist activity directed at or affecting official U.S. Government interests. Although \nRussia continued to prioritize counterterrorism efforts in 2017, it remained a target of \ninternational terrorist groups, particularly ISIS. \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRussia has attempted to reassert its dominance in, and integration of, the former \nSoviet states and has generally been successful with Belarus and Armenia. It has \nremained unwelcomingly active in the internal affairs of several of its neighboring \ncountries\u2014former republics of the Soviet Union or occupied \u201cindependent countries\u201d\u2014 \nsuch as Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and Moldova, and has issued threats against \nPoland (a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) since 1999), the \nCzech Republic (a member of NATO since 1999), and Estonia (a member of NATO \nsince 2004). Russia maintains an extensive military presence in Crimea and is likely to \ntake further military actions in Crimea as part of its occupation of this part of Ukraine. \nThe international community, including the United States and Ukraine, does not \nrecognize Russia\u2019s purported annexation of Crimea. In response to Russia\u2019s violations \nof Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty, and other acts, the United States suspended most bilateral \nengagement with the Russian government on economic issues. Anti-American and anti-\nWestern rhetoric is widespread in both official media sources and on social media. \nIn its 2019 Human Rights Report, the Department of State reported that Russia\u2019s \noccupation and purported annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimean Peninsula continued to \naffect the human rights situation in Russia significantly and negatively. Credible \nobservers attributed thousands of civilian deaths and injuries, as well as widespread \nabuses, to Russian-led forces in Ukraine\u2019s Donbas region and to Russian occupation \nauthorities in Crimea. Human rights groups asserted that numerous Ukrainian citizens \nremained in Russia as political prisoners. \nThe most significant human rights issues in Russia included extrajudicial killings; \nenforced disappearance; torture that was systematic and sometimes resulted in death \nand sometimes included punitive psychiatric incarceration; harsh and life-threatening \nconditions in prisons; arbitrary arrest and detention; lack of judicial independence; \npolitical prisoners; severe interference with privacy; severe restrictions on freedom of \nexpression and the media; increasingly severe restriction on freedom of association, \nincluding laws on \u201cforeign agents\u201d and \u201cundesirable foreign organizations\u201d; and \nwidespread corruption at all levels and in all branches of government. The government \nfailed to take adequate steps to prosecute or punish most officials who committed \nabuses, resulting in a climate of impunity. \nCybercrime is also a significant problem across Russia. The risk of infection, \ncompromise, and theft via malware, spam email, sophisticated spear phishing, and \nsocial engineering attacks is significant. Telephone and electronic communications are \nsubject to surveillance at any time without advisory. The Russian System for \nOperational-Investigative Activities permits authorities to monitor and record all data that \ntraverses Russia\u2019s networks. \nGeorgia \nThe geographical area encompassing Georgia has a history of outside \ndomination by Persians, Arabs, Turks, and Soviets. Following the Russian Revolution, it \nwas forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union in 1921, and it regained its \nindependence when the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991.

The constitution \nprovides for an executive branch that reports to the prime minister, a unicameral \nparliament, and a separate judiciary. The government is accountable to parliament. The \npresident is the head of state and commander in chief. Under the constitution that came \ninto force after December 2018, future presidents are not to be elected by popular vote. \nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe observers described the first round \nof the October 2018 presidential elections as competitive and professionally \nadministered. \nThe Ministry of Internal Affairs and the State Security Service of Georgia (SSSG) \nhave primary responsibility for law enforcement and maintenance of public order. The \nministry is the primary law enforcement organization and includes the national police \nforce, the border security force, and the Georgian Coast Guard. The SSSG is the \ninternal intelligence service responsible for counterintelligence, counterterrorism, and \nanticorruption efforts. There were indications that at times civilian authorities did not \nmaintain effective control of domestic security forces. \nIn 2008, an exchange of gunfire/artillery between Georgian and separatist forces \nin South Ossetia escalated into a full-blown war between Georgia and Russia. Since \n2008, Russia has stationed forces in Abkhazia and South Ossetia. The Department of \nState has issued a Travel Advisory for Georgia as Level 4 \u2013 \u201cdo not travel warning\u201d for \nthe Russian-occupied regions due to COVID-19, crime, civil unrest, and landmines. \nGeorgia has been assessed as being a medium-threat location for terrorism directed at \nor affecting official U.S. government interests. Georgia\u2019s geographical proximity to Iran, \nTurkey, Azerbaijan, and the Russian North Caucasus region, all of which have \nexperienced some measure of recent terrorist-related activity, continues to be of \nconcern. While Georgia has made strides with respect to border control and integrity, its \ngeographic location makes it a natural transit area for terrorists from these regions \ntraveling to Syria and Iraq. \nGeorgia faces two separate and distinct streams of anti-U.S. sentiment: U.S.\u00ad\nRussian relations, and anti-U.S.-rhetoric that originates within small Islamist groups. A \nsizeable minority prefer alignment with Russia. The U.S. Department of State has \nassessed Tbilisi, the Georgian capital, as being a high-threat location for political \nviolence directed at or affecting official U.S. government interests. \nIn 2019, significant human rights issues in Georgia included: unlawful or arbitrary \ndeprivation of life by Russian and de facto authorities in the Russian-occupied Georgian \nregions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, including unlawful or arbitrary killing in \nAbkhazia; arbitrary detentions by the government and Russian and de facto authorities; \nsignificant problems with the independence of the judiciary and investigations and \nprosecutions widely considered to be politically motivated; unlawful interference with \nprivacy; inappropriate police force against journalists; substantial inappropriate police \n9 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nforce against protesters; and crimes involving violence or threats targeting lesbian, gay, \nbisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) persons. De facto authorities in the \nRussian-occupied regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia remained outside central \ngovernment control and were supported by Russian forces. Ethnic Georgians were \nrestricted in many ways: they were unable to vote, own property, register businesses, \nand travel. \nWhile the official U.S. commentary regarding Georgia focuses on corruption, \nhuman rights violations, hostility between Russia and Georgia, especially in and near \nthe Russian-occupied regions of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, and terrorist activities, \nthere is little, if any, evidence that Georgia is an active participant in economic \nespionage, industrial espionage or trade theft, or is a violator of export-control \nregulations. \nFinancial Considerations \nGeneral source information pertaining to the financial issues discussed below \ncan be found in the following exhibits: GE 1 (SF 86, dated November 26, 2017); GE 2 \n(Enhanced Subject Interviews, dated December 13-14, 2017; and March 7, 2018); GE 3 \n(Combined Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax Credit Report, dated November 29, \n2017); and GE 4 (Equifax Credit Report, dated April 2, 2019). \nIn her SF 86, and again during her interview with an investigator from the U.S. \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM), Applicant acknowledged the existence of \nseveral delinquent accounts. (GE 1, at 51-57; GE 2, at 8, 24) In February 2015, she lost \na part-time job with an employer that furnished her most of her income, and when she \nrealized that she would be unable to maintain her accounts in a current status, she \nengaged the services of a debt-relief company to assist her in resolving her debts. \nFollowing their guidance, she paid that organization, but negotiations with her creditors \ndid not commence until her debts were sent to collection. Upon discovering the process, \nshe terminated her agreement with that debt-relief company and started addressing her \ncreditors directly to set up repayment agreements. (GE 1, at 54-57; Tr. at 74-75) In \n2017, she was ill, suffered a miscarriage, and was unable to work for two months. Her \nthen-husband, initially a janitor, and later a Lyft driver, was also sick. (Tr. at 80) In order \nto earn sufficient funds to continue addressing her debts, she has been working a \nnumber of concurrent jobs. \nThe SOR alleged three delinquent debts totaling approximately $41,547, as set \nforth as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 2.a. is an automobile loan with a high credit of approximately $30,000 that \nwas past due $1,035, and had an unpaid balance of $22,484. (GE 4, at 2) When she \ninitially applied for the loan, but because her then-husband did not yet have a Social \nSecurity number, the proposed loan was marketed to the eventual lender with an 18 \npercent interest rate. She attempted to refinance the loan but was denied because of \nher poor credit history. (GE 2, at 10) Nevertheless, Applicant routinely made her \nmonthly payments commencing in July 2016.

(AE H) The account \nhas been resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 2.b. is a credit-card account with a high credit of $17,356 and a past-due \nbalance of $12,079 that was placed for collection and charged off in 2015. (GE 4, at 2; \nGE 3, at 6) Applicant made several payments, reducing the unpaid balance to \napproximately $16,557 as of May 2017. In August 2017, a default judgment was \nentered against her for that amount, later adjusted to approximately $16,643. (GE 6; AE \nG) Initially, some payments were through garnishment. In January 2018, Applicant and \nthe collection agent agreed to a repayment plan under which, commencing in January \n2018, she agreed to make monthly payments of $259. As of December 2020, the \nunpaid balance had been reduced to approximately $6,478. (GE 5; AE G; Tr. at 80-81) \nThe account is in the process of being resolved. \nSOR \u00b6 2.c. is a credit-card account with a high credit of $5,406 and a past-due \nbalance of $2,420 that was placed for collection and charged off in 2015. (GE 4, at 2; \nGE 3, at 9) Applicant made several payments commencing in 2015, and although a \ncomplaint was filed against her in 2017 (and dismissed in 2020), she continued making \nmonthly payments until May 2020, when the account was paid in full. (GE 8; AE I; Tr. at \n81-83) The account has been resolved. \nApplicant submitted a Personal Financial Statement in which she reported a net \nmonthly income of approximately $4,644; $1,015 in monthly expenses; approximately \n$4,281 in routine mortgage, credit card, and tax payments; and a monthly remainder of \napproximately $363 available for discretionary spending or savings.

Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines \nare applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of \nvariables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind \nmight accept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the \nrecord.\u201d  (ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.32.1))  \u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a \npreponderance.\u201d  (See v. Washington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  \nCir. 1994).) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced \nsubstantial evidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the \napplicant has the burden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, \nextenuation or mitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s \ncase. The burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. \n(See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).) \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as \nwell. It is because of this special relationship that the Government must be able to \nrepose a high degree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants \naccess to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nas to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nFurthermore, \u201csecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of \ndenials.\u201d (Id.) \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no \nsense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d (See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7) Thus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that I have \nbased this decision, in whole or in part, on any express or implied determination as to \nApplicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or patriotism. It is merely an indication the Applicant has \nor has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \n12 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nestablished for issuing a clearance. In reaching this decision, I have drawn only those \nconclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in the \nrecord. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Foreign Influence is set out in \nAG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern \nif they create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology. \nWhen an allegation under a disqualifying condition is established, \u201cthe Directive \npresumes there is a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct or \ncircumstances . . . and an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. Direct or objective evidence of \nnexus is not required.\u201d  (ISCR Case No. 17-00507 at 2 (App. Bd. June 13, 2018) (citing \nISCR Case No. 15-08385 at 4 (App. Bd. May 23, 2018)) \nThe mere possession of close family ties with a person in a foreign country is not, \nas a matter of law, disqualifying under Guideline B.

Feb. 8, 2001)) Applicant\u2019s \nrelationship with her mother and two cousins in Russia, are current concerns for the \nGovernment. However, the security significance of these identified concerns requires \nfurther examination of Applicant\u2019s respective relationships with those family members \nwho are either Russian citizen-residents (her two cousins) or a Russian citizen-part-time \nor temporary resident (her mother) to determine the degree of \u201cheightened risk\u201d or \npotential conflict of interest. The issues regarding her most recent ex-husband (a dual \ncitizen of the United States and Georgia, residing in the United States), his parents, \nsiblings, and extended family members (Georgian citizen-residents) are significantly \nreduced because her relationship with those individuals has been terminated as a result \nof her divorce. The current status of Applicant\u2019s daughter-in-law (a citizen of Georgia, \nbut a permanent U.S. resident awaiting naturalization as a U.S. citizen), has also greatly \ndiminished, if not extinguished, any security concerns. \nIn assessing whether there is a heightened risk because of an applicant\u2019s \nrelatives in a foreign country, it is necessary to consider all relevant factors, including \nthe totality of an applicant\u2019s conduct and circumstances, including the realistic potential \nfor exploitation. One such factor is the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress. In that regard, it is important to consider the character of the foreign power in \nquestion, including the government and entities controlled by the government, within the \nrelevant foreign country. Nothing in Guideline B suggests it is limited to countries that \nare hostile to the United States. (See ISCR Case No. 00-0317 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, \n2002); ISCR Case No. 00-0489 at 12 (App. Bd. Jan. 10, 2002)) In fact, the Appeal \nBoard has cautioned against \u201creliance on overly simplistic distinctions between \u2018friendly\u2019 \nnations and \u2018hostile\u2019 nations when adjudicating cases under Guideline B.\u201d (ISCR Case \nNo. 00-0317 at 6 (App. Bd. Mar. 29, 2002)) \nThere is a rebuttable presumption that a person has ties of affection for, or \nobligation to, his or her family members, and this presumption includes in-laws.

Mar. 13, \n2017)) Another important consideration is the nature of a nation\u2019s government\u2019s \nrelationship with the United States. These factors are relevant in assessing the \nlikelihood that an applicant\u2019s family members living in that country are vulnerable to \ngovernment coercion or inducement. \n14 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe risk of coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign \ncountry has an authoritarian government, the government ignores the rule of law \nincluding widely accepted civil liberties, a family member is associated with or \ndependent upon the government, the government is engaged in a counterinsurgency, \nterrorists cause a substantial amount of death or property damage, or the country is \nknown to conduct intelligence collection operations against the United States. The \nrelationship of Russia with the United States, and the situation in Russia place a burden \nof persuasion on Applicant to demonstrate that her relationships with any family \nmember living in Russia does not pose a security risk. Applicant should not be placed \ninto a position where she might be forced to choose between loyalty to the United \nStates and a desire to assist a relative living in Russia. As noted above, the situation \nregarding Georgia has substantially been mitigated. \nWhile there is no evidence that intelligence operatives, criminals, or terrorists \nfrom or in Russia or Georgia seek or have sought classified or economic information \nfrom or through Applicant or her family, nevertheless, it is not prudent to rule out such a \npossibility in the future. International terrorist groups are known to conduct intelligence \nactivities as effectively as capable state intelligence services, and Russia has a \nsignificant problem with terrorism and crime. With Applicant\u2019s daughter-in-law residing in \nthe United States, the issue is largely eliminated. Applicant\u2019s family in Russia \u201ccould be \na means through which Applicant comes to the attention of those who seek U.S. \ninformation or technology and who would attempt to exert coercion upon him.\u201d (ADP \nCase No. 14-01655 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 9, 2015) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-02950 at 3 \n(App. Bd. May 14, 2015)) \nApplicant\u2019s relationships with relatives who are living in Russia create a potential \nconflict of interest because Russian intelligence operatives could place pressure on or \noffer inducements to her family in Russia in an effort to cause Applicant to compromise \nclassified information. These relationships create a potential heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) have been \nestablished. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from foreign influence under AG \u00b6 8: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States;  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, group, government, or country is \nso minimal, or the individual has such deep and longstanding relationships \n15 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand loyalties in the U.S., that the individual can be expected to resolve any \nconflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest; and \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nApplicant has substantial connections to the United States, having lived in the \nUnited States for over a decade. Her son is a naturalized U.S. citizen serving with the \nU.S. Marine Corps, and her daughter-in-law resides in the United States, with a Green \nCard, awaiting her own naturalization. Her mother, a Green Card holder, is awaiting her \nreturn to the United States once the COVID-19 situation is resolved. Applicant owns a \nresidence in the United States.  \nDepartment Counsel argued that the presence of terrorist groups; the increased \nlevels of terrorism, violence, and insurgency; and human rights problems in Russia and \nGeorgia demonstrate that a heightened risk of exploitation, coercion or duress are \npresent due to Applicant\u2019s close ties to her family. Based on their various relationships, \nand the geographical locations of Applicant\u2019s family, there is a potential, but greatly \nreduced, risk \u2013 a \u201cheightened risk\u201d \u2013 of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, \npressure, or coercion to disqualify Applicant from holding a security clearance. \nHowever, that risk is not generated solely by the Russian or Georgian \ngovernments, but also by terrorists striking out against the central Russian and \nGeorgian authorities and all foreigners. Applicant\u2019s family members are potential targets \nin this war on civilized humanity. However, the Georgian government is not focusing on \neconomic espionage, industrial espionage or trade secret theft. Applicant\u2019s mother and \nRussian cousins are merely potential targets in this war on civilized humanity. The \npresence of radical groups and increased levels of terrorism, violence, and insurgency \nin both Russia and Georgia have also been described for events (terrorism, civil unrest, \nand other riots) occurring on September 11, 2001, and more recently in Fort Hood, \nBoston, Paris, Nice, Orlando, San Bernardino, Portland, Seattle, Minneapolis, Kenosha, \nand New York City. \nThere is no evidence that Applicant\u2019s family members are or have ever been \npolitical activists, challenging the policies of the Russian government; that terrorists \nhave approached or threatened them for any reason; that the Russian or Georgian \ngovernments or any terrorist organizations have approached them; or that they currently \nengage in activities that would bring attention to themselves. As such, there is a \nreduced possibility that they would be targets for coercion or exploitation by the Russian \ngovernment or the terrorists, which may seek to quiet those who speak out against \nthem. They reside far from the areas of turmoil in Russia: Chechnya and the Northern \nCaucasus. Under these circumstances, the potential heightened risk created by their \nresidence in Russia is greatly diminished. Under the developed evidence, it is unlikely \nApplicant will be placed in a position of having to choose between the interests of a \nforeign individual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the United \nStates. I am persuaded that Applicant\u2019s loyalty to the United States is steadfast and \n16 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nundivided, and that she has \u201csuch deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in \nthe U.S., that she can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. \ninterest.\u201d AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b) apply. As to her former husband\u2019s family in Georgia, AG \u00b6 \n8(c) applies. \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts;  \n(b) unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant had three delinquent SOR-alleged accounts totaling approximately \n$41,547. She claimed that she did not have sufficient funds to maintain them in a \ncurrent status. When the SOR was issued in April 2020, two of her accounts were still \ndelinquent, although she had made significant strides in making payments to her \ncreditors. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) have been established, but there is insufficient \nevidence that Applicant had been unwilling to satisfy her debts regardless of an ability to \ndo so, and AG \u00b6 19(b) has not been established. \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \n17 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndoubt on the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is \nbeing resolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 20(a), 20(b), 20(c), and 20(d) fully or partially apply. A debt that became \ndelinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, \nunpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as \nrecent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 at 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, \n2016)). Applicant attributed some of her financial problems to having lost a significant \npart-time job in 2015; following the guidance of the debt-relief company in 2016; her \npoor health and miscarriage, leaving her unable to work for two months; and her then-\nhusband\u2019s limited income.  \nClearance decisions are aimed at evaluating an applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, \nand trustworthiness. They are not a debt-collection procedure. The guidelines do not \nrequire an applicant to establish resolution of every debt or issue alleged in the SOR. \nAn applicant needs only to establish a plan to resolve financial problems and take \nsignificant actions to implement the plan. There is no requirement that an applicant \nimmediately resolve issues or make payments on all delinquent debts simultaneously; \nnor is there a requirement that the debts or issues alleged in an SOR be resolved first. \nRather, a reasonable plan and concomitant conduct may provide for the payment of \nsuch debts, or resolution of such issues, one at a time. In this instance, Applicant\u2019s \ninitial plan was to follow the guidance of the debt-relief company, but when she became \ndisenchanted with their procedures, she chose direct contact with her creditors. \nApplicant managed to address all three of her SOR-related delinquent accounts \nbefore the SOR was issued. She made arrangements with her creditors or collection \nagents and has remained in compliance with those arrangements. Two accounts were \nresolved before the SOR was received. The remaining account has been substantially \nreduced. An applicant who begins to resolve financial problems only after being placed \non notice that his or her security clearance is in jeopardy may be lacking in the \njudgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is \nno immediate threat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at \n18 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n5 (App. Bd.

Her strong showing that her accounts are now resolved, or about to \nbe resolved, along with steady employment that would increase in the amount of money \nthat will be available for discretionary spending or savings each month, indicate that the \nfinancial problems are substantially in the past. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood-faith\u201d mitigating condition], \nan applicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at \nresolving the applicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \n\u201cgood-faith.\u201d However, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-\nfaith \u201crequires a showing that a person acts in a way that shows \nreasonableness, prudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d  \n(internal citation and footnote omitted) ISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, \n2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 at 5-6 (App. Bd. Jun. 4, 2001)). \nWhile there is no evidence of financial counseling, Applicant did seek assistance \nfrom an organization to clean up her financial situation. She subsequently cancelled the \nprofessional relationship and started addressing her delinquent accounts by herself. \nThe timeliness of her efforts to resolve her debts is very good, as are the subsequent \nsubstantial positive and successful efforts. She is apparently in a much better position \nfinancially than she had been. Applicant\u2019s actions, under the circumstances, no longer \ncast doubt on her current reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. See ISCR \nCase No. 09-08533 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n19 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I have \nevaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record evidence \nand have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 F.2d \n389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, \n2006).) \nThere is some evidence against mitigating Applicant\u2019s situation. A Guideline B \ndecision concerning Russia must take into consideration the geopolitical situation and \ndangers there. (See ISCR Case No. 04-02630 at 3 (App. Bd. May 23, 2007) (remanding \nbecause of insufficient discussion of geopolitical situation and suggesting expansion of \nwhole-person discussion).) Russia has a history of espionage against the United States \nand violence from terrorists, and the Russian government does not respect the full \nspectrum of human rights. Yes, Russia is a bad actor on the international stage. \nApplicant\u2019s septuagenarian mother is a Russian citizen temporarily residing in Russia, \nand her two cousins, both of whom are Russian citizens, reside in Russia. While they \nare more vulnerable to direct coercion or exploitation, because of their ages and low \npolitical profiles, as well as their geographic locations within Russia, the realistic \npossibility of pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress with regard to them is relatively \nlow. Her son was born in Russia, and his wife was born in Georgia. By way of her now-\nbroken relationship with her most recent ex-husband, Applicant had a relationship with \nnot only her ex-husband, a dual U.S.-Georgia citizen residing in the United States, but \nalso with his family, including his father who was a member of the Russian KGB. In \naddition, Applicant had several financial accounts that became delinquent, and \nremained in that status for some time. \nThe mitigating evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. Applicant is a 47-year-old Russian-born naturalized U.S. citizen. She \narrived in the United States in November 2009, and she was naturalized in August \n2013. She is an employee of several organizations, serving as either a part-time \ninterpreter, a Russian instructor, or an Uber driver, as well as a full-time linguist, with \nthose employers. Her last position before leaving Russia was as a professional church \nsinger from 2004 until 2009. A 1991 high school graduate, her Russian educational \npursuits were subsequently evaluated as the equivalence of a bachelor\u2019s degree in \neducation and a master\u2019s degree in English. Her Russian-born mother is still a Russian \ncitizen, temporarily residing in Russia, but as the holder of a Green Card, she \nanticipates returning to the United States after the COVID-19 issues are resolved. \nApplicant\u2019s Russian-born son is a naturalized U.S. citizen, and he is in the U.S. Marine \nCorps. Applicant\u2019s Georgia-born daughter-in-law has a Green Card, and she resides in \nthe United States, awaiting her opportunity for naturalization. Applicant owns a \nresidence in the United States. She has resolved two of her debts and is in the process \nof resolving the one remaining debt. With regard to those family members already in the \nUnited States, as well as the anticipated return of her mother from Russia, there is a \nreduced \u201cheightened risk\u201d of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or \ncoercion. While she still retains an affection for her two cousins who have remained \n20 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \ncitizens and residents of Russia, her contacts with them have diminished substantially \nfrom where they were initially. \nMoreover, while terrorist activities occur in Russia and Georgia, they are also \nactive in the United States, creating a \u201cheightened risk\u201d here as well. Under the \nevidence presented, I have no questions about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nand ability to protect classified information. See AG \u00b6 2(a)(1) through AG \u00b6 2(a)(9). \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the security concerns arising from the Government\u2019s \nforeign influence concerns and financial considerations. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.g.: \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. through 1.c.: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.  Eligibility for access to classified information is granted. \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n21 \n",

(Answer at 1; Tr. 24) \nFor the next few years, Applicant struggled, often going hungry so that she \u201ccould buy \nenough groceries for the children without making it obvious to them what was really going \non.\u201d (Answer at 1) Appellant\u2019s husband\u2019s disrespect of her evolved into contempt, as he \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwould sometimes arbitrarily cut off her cell phone, and ultimately led to sporadic acts of \nviolence, as he would sometimes respond to questions about the family finances by spitting \non her or hitting her on the head. (Tr. 17) \nIn January 2018, Applicant obtained another job. (AE D at 1) Seven months later, in \nJuly 2018, Applicant and her husband initiated the divorce process. (Answer at 1) Their \ndivorce was finalized in May 2019. (Tr. 29) Applicant moved in with her parents after the \ndivorce, and her ex-husband remained in the home. (Tr. 29) \nSubparagraphs 1.b and 1.c, totaling $32,000, are mortgage delinquencies on a \nrental property that Applicant and her ex-husband owned. They have been delinquent \nsince 2016. (GE 3 at 2) It was foreclosed on in May 2018. (Tr. 37) It resold for more than \nthe balance that Applicant and her husband owed, and is no longer in delinquent status. \n(Tr. 28; AE B at 1) \nSubparagraph 1.a is the delinquent mortgage account on the home where Applicant \nlived with her ex-husband. (Tr. 28) It has been delinquent since 2013. (GE 3 at 1) Although \nApplicant\u2019s attempts at negotiating a deed in lieu of foreclosure failed, she anticipates that \nupon foreclosure and resale, she will receive a surplus. Although her ex-husband still lives \nin the home, he has not been helping her resolve the mortgage. He has no incentive to \nhelp because he is legally joint owner of the home, as memorialized in the deed, but has \nno responsibility for the mortgage, which is solely in Applicant\u2019s name. (Answer at 2) \nAbsent her ex-husband\u2019s cooperation, the negotiations are at an impasse. \nApplicant\u2019s salary is $135,000. (Tr. 30) Because her parents do not charge her for \nrent, and she lives an austere lifestyle, she has been able to save $190,000. (Tr. 30; AE J) \nShe intends to use these savings to facilitate the settlement of the delinquent mortgage in \nSOR subparagraph 1.a in the event there is a deficiency. (Tr. 33) Applicant has no other \ndelinquent debts. \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion the Executive \nBranch has in regulating access to information pertaining to national security,  emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). When evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, \nthe administrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are required to be considered in \nevaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. These guidelines \nare not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, \nthese guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative \nprocess. The administrative judge\u2019s overall adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \njudge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 1(d) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence \nto establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant \nis responsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel. . . .\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must consider the totality \nof an applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances in light of the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). They are as follows: \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; \n(2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; \n(3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; \n(4) the individual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; \n(5) the extent to which participation is voluntary; \n(6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other permanent behavioral \nchanges; \n(7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and \n(9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns about financial considerations are set forth in AG \u00b6 18, as \nfollows: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet\nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information . . . . An individual who is financially\noverextended is at risk of having to engage in illegal acts to generate funds.\n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant\u2019s history of delinquent debt generates security concerns under AG \u00b6 19(a), \n\u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and AG \u00b6 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting financial, consistent \nwith the plan. Applicant\u2019s financial problems stemmed from an abusive husband who \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmismanaged their finances and misappropriated her pay without her knowledge to support \na secret lifestyle. When she realized the extent of his deception shortly after her job layoff, \nshe began questioning him more about his financial management, and he responded with \nthreats, intimidation, and violence. \nThe mortgages set forth in SOR subparagraphs 1.b and 1.c were satisfied through \nthe foreclosure process. Applicant obtained a new job in 2018 and moved in with her \nparents in May 2019 after the finalization of her divorce. Since then, she has saved \napproximately $190,000, and is negotiating the resolution of the outstanding mortgage set \nforth in subparagraph 1.a. She has no other delinquent debts, and it is unlikely that her \nfinancial problems will recur because she is no longer married to her spendthrift husband. \nUnder these circumstances, the following mitigating conditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 20(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely\nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn,\nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear\nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the\nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUpon considering this case in the context of the whole-person concept, particularly \nwith respect to the surrounding circumstances, the presence of rehabilitation, and the \nminimal likelihood of recurrence, I conclude that Applicant has mitigated the financial \nconsiderations security concern. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.c: \nFor Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the interests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

The SOR also alleges that Applicant was arrested and charged with possession and use of drug-related objects in December 2014 and that she tested positive for opiates and benzodiazepines in August 2018. The SOR further alleges that Applicant was required by her employer to receive treatment beginning in August 2018 for conditions diagnosed as amphetamine and opioids use disorders, but after failing her urinalysis in September 2018 by testing positive for opiates, she was terminated from her employment and she discontinued treatment.

Hayes, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro se \n03/09/2021 \nDecision \nHESS, Stephanie C., Administrative Judge: \nThis case involves security concerns raised under Guideline H (Drug Involvement \nand Substance Misuse) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). Applicant failed to mitigate \nthe security concerns raised by her recent illegal drug use and drug-related conduct and \nher omissions and falsifications regarding it. Eligibility for access to classified information \nis denied. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (e-QIP) on January 28, 2019. \nOn April 30, 2020, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent her a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR), alleging security concerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance \nMisuse) and Guideline E (Personal Conduct). The DOD acted under Executive Order \n(E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), \nas amended; DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative \nguidelines (AG) implemented by DOD on June 8, 2017. \nApplicant answered the SOR and requested a decision on the record without a \nhearing.

On October 16, 2020, a complete copy of the file of relevant material (FORM,) \nwhich included Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 5, was sent to Applicant. The DOHA \ntransmittal letter informed Applicant that she had 30 days after her receipt to file objections \nand submit material to refute, extenuate, or mitigate the Government\u2019s evidence. She \nreceived the FORM on October 23, 2020, and did not file a response. The DOHA \ntransmittal letter and receipt are marked as Administrative Exhibit 1. The case was \nassigned to me on January 21, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nUnder Guideline H, the SOR alleges that Applicant used heroin with varying \nfrequency from about December 2014 until about September 2018; amphetamines from \n2015 until August 2018; benzodiazepines in August 2018; and marijuana from 2011 until \n2018. The SOR also alleges that Applicant was arrested and charged with possession \nand use of drug-related objects in December 2014 and that she tested positive for opiates \nand benzodiazepines in August 2018. The SOR further alleges that Applicant was \nrequired by her employer to receive treatment beginning in August 2018 for conditions \ndiagnosed as amphetamine and opioids use disorders, but after failing her urinalysis in \nSeptember 2018 by testing positive for opiates, she was terminated from her employment \nand she discontinued treatment. Applicant admits each of these allegations with \nexplanations. \nUnder Guideline E, the SOR alleges that Applicant falsified three of her responses \nregarding illegal drug use on her 2019 e-QIP; that she was terminated by her employer \nin September 2018 for violation of rules and is not eligible for rehire; that she falsified the \nreason for leaving this employment on her 2019 e-QIP; and that she falsified material \nfacts about her drug use and her reason for leaving her employment in 2018 during her \npersonal subject interview (PSI) in April 2019. Applicant admits each of these allegations. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions are incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant, 27, is an associate technical professional in test engineering employed \nby a defense contractor since January 2019. She received her bachelor\u2019s degree in \nmechanical engineering in 2016. She and her husband married in 2016. This is her first \napplication for security clearance. (GX 2.) \nThe information in the record regarding Applicant\u2019s drug abuse is derived from two \nsources: Applicant\u2019s treatment records wherein she provided written information \nregarding her drug abuse, and the affirmed summary of the statements she made during \nher PSI. The information regarding her 2014 drug-related arrest is derived from these two \nsources and her FBI rap sheet. Applicant\u2019s reporting of the length and frequency of her \nuse of marijuana, opiates, amphetamines/methamphetamine, and other drugs is \ninconsistent within her two accounts. After considering the record to include Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions to the SOR allegations, I make the following findings of fact: \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nApplicant \nused \nheroin \nfrom \n2014 \nuntil \nat \nleast \n2018, \namphetamines/methamphetamine and benzodiazepines from at least 2015 \nuntil at least 2018, and marijuana from 2011 until at least 2018; \nApplicant was arrested in December 2014 while at a motel with her then-\nboyfriend now-husband after injecting heroin. She was charged with \npossession and use of drug-related objects, a misdemeanor, and \npossession of a Schedule I controlled substance (heroin), a felony. The \nfelony charge was not prosecuted and the misdemeanor charge was \ndismissed;  \nApplicant first used heroin, amphetamines/methamphetamine, and \nbenzodiazepines with her boyfriend/husband; \nIn August 2018, Applicant was late for work because she was passed out \nin her car in the parking lot. Applicant had been injecting heroin and \nmethamphetamine throughout the previous night. Applicant told her \nsupervisor that she had been injecting methamphetamine, her supervisor \ncalled the paramedics, and Applicant was hospitalized; \nAfter this incident, as a condition of continued employment, Applicant\u2019s \nemployer required her to complete a treatment program. Applicant \nunderwent an evaluation, was diagnosed with amphetamine and opioids \nuse disorders, and was prescribed outpatient treatment which she entered \non August 13, 2018; \nWhile in treatment, Applicant tested positive for opiates during a random \ndrug screening conducted by her employer. She denied any illegal drug use, \nstating that she did not understand how she could have tested positive, but \nwas terminated from her employment. She discontinued treatment; \nApplicant intentionally failed to disclose her illegal drug use and her \ntreatment on her 2019 e-QIP and initially during her PSI; \nApplicant intentionally failed to disclose her termination from employment \non her 2019 e-QIP and initially during her PSI; \nApplicant has not participated in any additional drug treatment; \nApplicant repeatedly lied to the investigator during her PSI until the \ninvestigator confronted her with the information about her illegal drug use, \ndrug treatment, and termination from employment. \nApplicant stated in her PSI that she has not illegally used drugs since she entered \ntreatment in August 2018, reiterating that she did not understand how she tested positive \nin September 2018 while in treatment.

She further stated that she and her husband \nhave agreed that they \u201cdo not need to use drugs anymore and they have heard horror \nstories about people who have used drugs.\u201d  \nIn her responses to DOHA\u2019s interrogatories, Applicant stated, \u201cWhile I have not \ncompleted treatment, I have not returned to any substance abuse. Moving from my \nprevious residence and contacts . . . helped the situation greatly.\u201d Applicant also asserted \nthat she was \u201cvery forthcoming\u201d during her PSI, further stating that her illegal drug use \nand related conduct were mistakes that she has moved past and that she hopes her \n\u201chonesty and good behavior since are taken into account\u201d in her security clearance \ndetermination. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant\u2019s meeting the \ncriteria contained in the AG. These guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, \nrecognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge applies these \nguidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative \njudge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available and reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. \n10865 \u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the \napplicant has not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense \nhave established for issuing a clearance. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information.

Between 2014 \nand 2018, she used heroin, amphetamines/methamphetamine, benzodiazepines, and \nmarijuana with varying frequency. After a significant drug-related incident at work in \nAugust 2018, Applicant\u2019s employer required her to successfully complete a drug treatment \nprogram as a condition of continued employment. She underwent an evaluation and was \ndiagnosed as having amphetamine and opioid use disorders and was prescribed \noutpatient treatment. Despite her conditional employment, Applicant tested positive for \nopioids and benzodiazepines while in treatment. She denied any illegal drug use, but was \nterminated from her employment and did not successfully complete the program. She has \nnot engaged in any other drug treatment.  \n \nIn her April 2019 PSI and her February 2020 responses to interrogatories, Applicant \nasserted that she had not illegally used drugs since before she entered treatment in August \n2018. She also stated that she had no future intention of using illegal drugs and that she \nno longer associated with anyone who uses illegal drugs. \n \nThere are no Abright line@ rules for determining when conduct is Arecent.@ The \ndetermination must be based on a careful evaluation of the totality of the evidence.

Aug. 4, 2004). \nIn considering the totality of the evidence, particularly Applicant\u2019s long period of \nillegal drug use until at least 2018, her dishonesty regarding such use and her lack of \nregard for the consequences of her illegal drug use including her termination from \nemployment, I conclude that Applicant\u2019s illegal use was recent and casts doubt on her \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. Further, given her ongoing denial \nof use after testing positive while in treatment, her failure to continue treatment, and her \nstatement that she should be given credit for her honesty regarding her illegal drug use, \nI find her assertions that she has not used illegal drugs since August 2018, will not do so \nin the future, and no longer associates with anyone who uses illegal drugs to lack \ncredibility and that her illegal drug use is likely to recur. AG \u00b6\u00b6 25(a) through 25(c) and \n25(e) apply. None of the mitigating conditions apply. \nGuideline E: Personal Conduct \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation. Of special interest is any failure to cooperate or provide truthful and candid \nanswers during national security investigative or adjudicative processes. The following \nwill normally result in an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security eligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a security \ninvestigator for subject interview, completing security forms or releases, \ncooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or polygraph \nexamination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \n \nAG \u00b6 16: Conditions that could raise a security concern and may be disqualifying \ninclude: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16(a): deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant \nfacts from any personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, \nor similar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 16(b): deliberately providing false or misleading information; or \nconcealing or omitting information, concerning relevant facts to an \nemployer, investigator, security official, competent medical or mental health \nprofessional involved in making a recommendation relevant to a national \nsecurity eligibility determination, or other official government representative; \nAG \u00b6 16(c): credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas \nthat is not sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-person \nassessment of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack \nof candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, or other \ncharacteristics indicating that the individual may not properly safeguard \nclassified or sensitive information; \nAG \u00b6 17: Conditions that could mitigate security concerns include: \nAG \u00b6 17(a): the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the \nomission, concealment, or falsification before being confronted with the \nfacts; \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nAG \u00b6 17(d): the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained \ncounseling to change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate \nthe stressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely to \nrecur; and \nAG \u00b6 17(g): association with persons involved in criminal activities was \nunwitting, has ceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt \nupon the individual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations. \nApplicant admits that she intentionally falsified material facts on her 2018 e-QIP \nand repeatedly during her PSI. She did not disclose the derogatory information regarding \nher drug-related arrest, her illegal drug use, and her termination from employment until \nconfronted by the investigator. Despite failing a drug test that resulted in being terminated \nfrom her employment, Applicant continues to deny that she used illegal drugs. Her illegal \ndrug use and related conduct is recent and casts doubt on her current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, judgment, and willingness to comply with rules and regulations. Due to \nApplicant\u2019s false statements and omissions and her ongoing inconsistent statements, she \nlacks credibility regarding her future use of illegal drugs, drug-related conduct, and \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nassociation with individuals involved in criminal conduct. AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(a) through 16(c) apply. \nNone of the mitigating conditions apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(a). \nI have incorporated my comments under Guidelines H and E in my whole-person \nanalysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(a) were addressed under those guidelines, but I \nhave also considered the following: \nApplicant was not forthcoming about her recent illegal drug use and drug-related \nconduct to include her 2014 arrest and 2018 termination from employment. Despite her \ndiagnoses of drug dependence, she has not completed any treatment. She continues to \ndeny her recent drug use that resulted in a positive drug test and termination from her \nemployment. Her lack of honesty and recent illegal drug use and drug-related conduct \ncontinues to cast doubt on her security-clearance worthiness. \nAfter weighing the disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guidelines H and \nE and evaluating all the evidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant \nhas not mitigated the security concerns raised by her conduct. Accordingly, I conclude \nshe has not carried her burden of showing that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to grant her eligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nAs required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, I make the following \nformal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H (Drug Involvement): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.f: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E ( Personal Conduct) \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a - 2.g:  \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance.

(Tr. 91-92) He came to the United States in 2001, at age 24, \non a student visa, to pursue a master\u2019s degree, which he earned in 2003. (GE 1 at 9; Tr. \n47-48, 92-93) He has worked for his current employer, a defense contractor, for 15 \nyears, since 2005. (Tr. 48) He is a software engineer, and has an annual salary of about \n$130,000. (Tr. 71, 73) Applicant became a U.S. citizen in 2015. Later in 2015, he \napplied for access to sensitive information. (GE 6, GE 7; Tr. 49) That application was \ngranted, and he now seeks a security clearance. (GE 1; Tr. 17) \nApplicant has been married twice. He was first married from 2002 to 2009. (Tr. \n49, 106) He and his second wife have been married since 2010. (GE 1; Tr. 49, 98) She \nis a Nigerian citizen and has permanent United States resident status until July 2023. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b) She has applied for U.S. citizenship. (Tr. 45-46, 99-100, 229-231) They \nhave three children, now ages 16, 8, and 5; all of them are native-born U.S. citizens. \n(GE 1; Tr. 50, 105-107) Applicant\u2019s wife works at a local university, where she also \nearned her degree. (Tr. 100-102) They own their current home and a former residence, \nboth in the United States. (Tr. 110-113) \nApplicant\u2019s mother and father are citizens and residents of Nigeria. (SOR \u00b6 1.a) \n(GE 1) They are in their eighties and are retired. His father owned a restaurant. His \nmother was an accountant. Applicant talks to his parents about once a month. (Tr. 64, \n69, 78-81, 260-261; GE 2 at 3) He testified that he does not provide them financial \nsupport. (Tr. 82) Applicant\u2019s two siblings reside in the United Kingdom (UK). They are \ndual UK-Nigerian citizens. (Tr. 83) \n3 \n \nAfter coming to the United States, Applicant returned to Nigeria in 2007 to see \nhis family and to attend a friend\u2019s wedding. (Tr. 67) He most recently travelled to Nigeria \nin January 2020 before traveling with family to the UK for his mother\u2019s 80th  birthday.

(Tr. 96-98, 225-226; GE 2 at 2) \nApplicant also went to the UK in 2017 for his father\u2019s 80th  birthday. (Tr. 81) His parents \nhave also visited the United States in the past. (Tr. 119) \nApplicant\u2019s mother-in-law was a naturalized U.S. citizen from Nigeria. She lived \nin the United States for many years, until passing away earlier this year. (Tr. 70-71; GE \n1) His father-in-law is deceased. (GE 1; GE 2) Applicant\u2019s wife has other family in \nNigeria but Applicant and his wife do not own property or have any financial interests \nthere. (Tr. 107-109) Applicant has two old friends in Nigeria that he keeps in touch with. \n(Tr. 93-95) \nIn about 2015, Applicant and his wife started a company (H) in the United States. \nThey hoped to use the business to export consumer products, such as baby food, to \nNigeria and other foreign countries where they saw a commercial need. They sought a \nbusiness partnership with large U.S. retailers but this pursuit was unsuccessful. The \ncompany remains in business. (Tr. 74, 208-213, 237-238; GE 4; GE 5) \nIn late 2016, Applicant\u2019s wife received a phone call from a man in Nigeria. She \ntold Applicant that the man, Mr. E, was a distant cousin of hers who needed help with \nhis business, and put Applicant on the phone with him. When they spoke, Mr. E told \nApplicant that he was a foreign-exchange broker, and that Mr. E wanted to use \nApplicant\u2019s bank accounts in the United States to transfer money between unknown \nindividuals in the U.S. and one of Mr. E\u2019s clients, a travel agency in South Africa. (GE 2 \nat 9; Tr. 50-60, 69) \nApplicant agreed to help Mr. E. Between October and December 2016, Applicant \nand Mr. E arranged and confirmed numerous bank transactions through a text \nmessaging application (app). (Tr. 50-54; 120; GE 4; GE 2 at 9) The transcript of their \ntext conversations is detailed in GE 4, a document provided by Applicant during his \nbackground interview and discussed in the hearing at Tr. 124-205. (The pages in GE 4 \nare in quadrants, and require a magnifying glass to read; see Tr. 77). \nApplicant gave Mr. E his bank routing number and account information to \nfacilitate the money transfers. When Mr. E or his associates in the United States had \nmade a deposit into Applicant\u2019s bank account, Mr. E would text Applicant a photo of the \ndeposit slip, and then Applicant would message his confirmation of the deposited funds. \n(Tr. 126-127) \nApplicant utilized several of his accounts at multiple U.S. banks for these \ntransactions. (Tr. 159, 170-171; GE 2 at 3, 9) He mostly used an account at Bank A, an \naccount that was largely a business bank account for his and his wife\u2019s company, \nCompany H. (Tr. 114, 123, 208-213; GE 5) Applicant also testified that he used the \nBank A account for his own personal and household expenses.

(GE 4 at 1, GE 4 at 5) (\u201cPlease talk to \n[Applicant\u2019s wife] about it.\u201d) By mid-November 2016, Applicant appears to have wanted \nCompany H to be more formally involved with the money transfers. As he told Mr. E in a \ntext on November 9, 2016, however, he recognized that Company H was not \u201clicensed \nto deal in currency. Otherwise any account will eventually be flagged if funds (especially \nlarge amounts) are consistently wired out of the country. This will need to be sorted \nproperly to ensure this is sustainable.\u201d (GE 4 at 5) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant testified that he would wire funds for Mr. E to various foreign bank \naccounts, in South Africa, China, and Turkey, as well as Nigeria. (Tr. 129-130, 160, \n175-176, 184, 243-244; GE 2 at 9) Applicant did not know any of the people he \ntransacted with. (Tr. 130) The deposits often involved large sums of money, almost \nalways well over $10,000 and at times over $100,000. (Tr. 130-131, 156-158, 173, 202) \nApplicant would then wire the deposited funds to Mr. E\u2019s client, the travel company, or \nto other foreign accounts. (GE 4 at 2) Most of the finds were in U.S. dollars but some of \nthe funds were in \u201cnaira,\u201d a Nigerian currency. (Tr. 143-146) \nA week later, that is exactly what happened, as Applicant reported to Mr E that \nthe bank had closed the account and refunded him the balance by check. (Tr. 56-60, \n189-194; GE 2 at 9; GE 4 at 5) Applicant said in his background interview that he told \nMr. E to stop arranging the deposits, but they continued for a time. (GE 2 at 9) \nAs late as December 15, 2016, though, Applicant was still pursuing a role for \nCompany H in the process. (\u201cThe document still doesn\u2019t state what [Company H\u2019s] role \nis in this process; when [Company H\u2019s] role is established, there\u2019s still the issue of \nlicensing to deal in / distribute currency here in the U.S.\u201d) (GE 4 at 5) \nApplicant said he had one more phone call with Mr. E after December 2016, but \nhas had no contact with him since then. Applicant\u2019s wife no longer has contact with Mr \nE. (Tr. 205-207) Applicant and Mr. E never met. (Tr. 225) \nApplicant was interviewed by the FBI in 2017, and cooperated with their \ninvestigation. He said in his background interview that the FBI told him that the \ntransactions suggested possible money laundering or a scam. Neither Applicant nor his \nwife were charged or arrested. (GE 2 at 9; Tr. 205, 229) \nApplicant testified that at the time he began the transactions with Mr. E, he \n\u201cthought nothing of it\u201d because it \u201cseemed like something legitimate\u201d (50-51) He said he \n\u201cjust thought I was doing my wife\u2019s family a favor. And then it turned into a nightmare.\u201d \n(Tr. 75) Applicant also testified that while he was engaged in the transactions with Mr. \nE, he became concerned about them. He testified that he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to have anything \nto do with any kind of fraud. I told him this on numerous occasions.\u201d He said the only \nreason he did it was because his wife recommended it.

(GE 1) In particular, Applicant did not disclose \nhis relationship with Mr. E in answering questions on his SCA such as \u201cHave you EVER \nprovided financial support for any foreign national?\u201d; and \u201cHave you in the last seven (7) \nyears provided advice or support to any individual associated with a foreign business or \nother foreign organization that you have not previously listed as a former employer?\u201d \nand \u201cHas any foreign national in the last seven (7) years offered you a job, asked you to \nwork as a consultant or consider employment with them?\u201d and \u201cHave you in the last \nseven (7) years been involved in any other type of business venture with a foreign \nnational not described above (own, co-own, serve as business consultant, provide \nfinancial support, etc.)\u201d (GE 1 at 29-30) Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to all of these \nquestions. Falsification of Applicant\u2019s SCA is not alleged in the SOR under Guideline E, \nbut this evidence can be considered in weighing mitigation and under the whole-person \nconcept. \nApplicant also did not disclose the transactions with Mr. E during his background \ninterviews and did not discuss them until he was confronted about them. (Tr. 147-148, \n207; GE 1, GE 2, GE 3) Applicant indicated that he did not initially disclose the \ntransactions because he assumed the government already knew about them. He was \nalso embarrassed about them and wanted to be done with the issue. (GE 2 at 8-9) \n \nApplicant has a cousin in Nigeria (Mr. O) to whom he is particularly close. (SOR \u00b6 \n1.c) Mr. O is \u201clike a brother\u201d to him. (Tr. 241) Mr. O was born in Nigeria. He lived in the \nUnited States from 1990 to about 2017. He is a dual U.S.-Nigerian citizen. (Tr. 46-47, \n89) (In addressing the admissibility of GE 2 and GE 3, Applicant\u2019s background interview \nsummaries, Applicant adopted them as accurate except where they describe Mr. O as a \nNigerian citizen only.) (Tr. 38-40) In fact, the summaries indicate that Applicant \ndescribed Mr. O as a dual citizen. (See, e.g., GE 2 at 6)) \nApplicant saw Mr. O on his trip to Nigeria in 2020. He said the cousin owns a \nfarm. (Tr. 68-69, 215, 225) Applicant acknowledged that they are close and they remain \nin quarterly contact. (Tr. 90-91) \nIn early January 2019, Applicant made several deposits into U.S. bank accounts, \nusing funds from his cousin Mr. O. The deposits totaled about $72,000. Applicant used \nthe money to purchase a luxury vehicle for Mr. O in the U.S., and to ship the vehicle to \nhim in Nigeria. (SOR \u00b6 2.b) (Tr. 60-62; 214-218, 227-229; GE 2 at 6) Applicant \nacknowledged that \u201cthere are probably only two or three people that I would even \nentertain buying a car for now in hindsight. And [Mr. O] is one of them.\u201d (Tr. 240) \nApplicant otherwise denied that he had ever wired money to Mr. O, and denied that Mr \nO was involved with the transactions Applicant had with Mr. E. (Tr. 219) \nApplicant had engaged in similar conduct previously. As addressed in the \nsummary of Applicant\u2019s April 5, 2019 background interview, Applicant has made similar \npurchases on his father\u2019s behalf about three times in recent years, with funds his father \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndeposited in Applicant\u2019s bank account.

(Tr. 86-89; GE 2 at 7) Applicant \ntestified that he has made no other wire transfers to any foreign companies or people. \n(Tr. 223-224) These transactions are not alleged in the SOR. \nApplicant denied doing anything illegal. (Tr. 64) He never suspected his actions \nmight be problematic until he was contacted by the FBI. (GE 2 at 9) Applicant also \ntestified that there was \u201cno chance in hell\u201d that he would again engage in financial \ntransactions like he did in 2016 with Mr. E, because \u201cI\u2019m living [in] hell already.\u201d (Tr. \n239) \u201cI would never do that again. Never,\u201d he said. (Tr. 241)  \n \nApplicant testified that his allegiance is to the United States, and it \u201cwouldn\u2019t even \nbe a hard decision for me.\u201d (Tr. 262) He has spent his adult life here. He has returned to \nNigeria only three times since emigrating to the U.S. He recognizes his poor judgment \nin hindsight and said he would not engage in that conduct again. (Tr. 261-266) \nApplicant provided reference letters from several personal friends and work \ncolleagues. They have all known him for 12-15 years, and attest to his trustworthiness, \ndiscipline, and dedication to his work; as well as his honesty and ability to protect \nsensitive information. (AE A) \nNigeria \nNigeria is a federal republic located in Western Africa. Its current president took \noffice in 2015, following the first democratic transfer of power in the country\u2019s history. He \nwas reelected in 2019. Nigeria has faced many challenges, including terrorist activity, \nsectarian conflicts, crime, kidnapping, and widespread mistrust of the government. \nThe U.S. State Department advises U.S. citizens to reconsider travel to Nigeria \ndue to COVID-19, crime, terrorism, civil unrest, kidnapping, and maritime crimes. Boko \nHaram and ISIS-West Africa, both U.S.-designated Foreign Terrorist Organizations, are \nactive in Nigeria, and seek to replace the Nigerian government with an Islamic state. \nAttacks against state and civilian targets, primarily northern Nigerian states continued in \nrecent years. \nFinancial and internet romance scams are prevalent in Nigeria. Scams are often \ninitiated through Internet postings/profiles or by unsolicited emails and letters. \nScammers almost always pose as U.S. citizens who have no one else to turn to for \nhelp. Common scams include: romance/online dating; money transfers; contracts with \npromises of large commissions; and inheritance notices. The fact that money transfers \nare prevalent scams in Nigeria is of particular relevance in this case. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHuman-rights issues in Nigeria in recent years have included unlawful and \narbitrary killings, forced disappearances, torture by both government and non-state \nactors, and arbitrary detention, often based on little evidence. Nigeria has one of the \nworld\u2019s lowest per capita social spending levels, resulting in sixty-five percent of its 186 \nmillion citizens living in extreme poverty. These conditions breed disaffection in youth, \nprovide an entry point for Islamic extremism, entice corruption, and promote ineffective \ngovernance. \nPolicies \nIt is well established that no one has a right to a security clearance. As the \nSupreme Court held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of Navy v. \nEgan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as \nthe \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have not drawn inferences grounded on \nmere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR.

Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nAG \u00b6 6 details the security concern about \u201cforeign contacts and interests\u201d as \nfollows: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they \nresult in divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if \nthey create circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or \ninduced to help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a \nway inconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to \npressure or coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign \ncontacts and interests should consider the country in which the foreign \ncontact or interest is located, including, but not limited to, considerations \nsuch as whether it is known to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or \nsensitive information or is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nAG \u00b6 7 indicates conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual's \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology; \n(e) shared living quarters with a person or persons, regardless of \ncitizenship status, if that relationship creates a heightened risk of foreign \ninducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion. \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human-rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion or inducement.

May 19, 2004). \nA heightened security risk in Nigeria is established by the administratively noticed \nfacts in the record. The security risks in Nigeria include the presence of Boko Haram \nand ISIS West Africa, as well as the more general concerns about crime, kidnapping, \nterrorism, and human rights issues. Of greatest relevance in this case, however, is the \nfact that financial scams are prevalent in Nigeria, particularly involving money transfers \n\u2013 conduct that is at the very heart of this case.  \nApplicant\u2019s elderly parents (SOR \u00b6 1.a) are citizens and residents of Nigeria. \nApplicant is understandably close to them. Applicant\u2019s cousin, Mr. O (SOR \u00b6 1.c) is a \ndual U.S.-Nigerian citizen who now lives in Nigeria. He and Applicant are very close, \nand Applicant regards him like a brother. Applicant has helped Mr. O purchase a car in \nthe United States. (SOR \u00b6 2.b, discussed below under Guideline E). AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and \n7(b) apply to Applicant\u2019s parents and to his cousin, Mr. O. (Mr. E, his wife\u2019s cousin, is \nnot alleged, nor are Applicant\u2019s two blood siblings, as they live in the United Kingdom.) \nIn addition, Applicant\u2019s wife is a Nigerian citizen and permanent U.S. resident. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.b) Her presence in the United States limits her security risk. However, it was \nshe who put Applicant in touch with Mr. E, her distant cousin in Nigeria, whose \ninteractions with Applicant are at the heart of the Guideline E case here, discussed \nbelow. AG \u00b6 7(e) applies to her, as do both AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b). \nAG \u00b6 8 lists conditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns, \nincluding: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in \nwhich these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be \nplaced in a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nU.S.; \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual's sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \n10 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and   \n(c) contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual or \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nApplicant has lived in the United States since his early 20s. He and his wife, a \nNigerian citizen and permanent U.S. resident, have three children, all native-born U.S. \ncitizens. They all live here and there is no indication that they intend to return to Nigeria \nto live. AG \u00b6 8(b) therefore has some application. \nHowever, the foreign influence concerns here are significant because of Nigeria\u2019s \ncontinuing instability and the persistent threat of terrorism and violence by armed \ninsurgents. Applicant has family members there to whom he quite understandably \ncontinues to have a close bond of affection and obligation. The heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion remains, and AG \u00b6 \n8(a) does not apply. \nApplicant\u2019s parents remain in Nigeria. So does his cousin, Mr. O, who he \nconsiders to be like a brother, and for whom Applicant helped purchase and ship a \nluxury vehicle in 2019, which he said he might consider doing again. Applicant recently \nvisited them, in early 2020. Applicant\u2019s wife also facilitated his contact and relationship \nwith Mr. E in late 2016, as they engaged in a series of highly suspicious money \ntransfers. Applicant may in the future be placed in a position where he has conflicted \ninterests. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(b) and 8(c) do not fully apply. Applicant has not met his heavy burden \nof persuasion in establishing that the foreign influence security concerns are mitigated. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern for personal conduct: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information; \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of client \nconfidentiality, release of proprietary information, unauthorized \nrelease of sensitive corporate or government protected information; \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources; and \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one's conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes: (1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson's personal, professional, or community standing. \nThe two Guideline E allegations both concern instances in which Applicant \nfacilitated money transfers, through his U.S. bank accounts, for Nigerian citizens and \nresidents. \n12 \n  \nFirst, for several months in late 2016, Applicant collaborated with Mr. E, a \nNigerian citizen and resident who his wife told him was an extended Nigerian family \nmember of hers, someone Applicant had never met, in transferring several hundred \nthousand dollars of U.S. funds through Applicant\u2019s U.S. bank accounts to Nigerian or \nother foreign accounts, in China, South Africa, and Turkey. The funds were deposited \ninto Applicant\u2019s accounts by other individuals, who Applicant also did not know. \nApplicant\u2019s U.S. bank subsequently froze his bank account due to the suspicious \nactivity, and his interactions with Mr. E ended in December 2016. They have not had \nany real contact since. In 2017, the FBI interviewed Applicant as part of an investigation \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninto possible money laundering or other illegal activity, but neither Applicant nor his wife \nwere charged. \nSecond, in 2019, Applicant purchased a luxury car in the U.S. for a cousin in \nNigeria, Mr, O, a man who Applicant considers to be like a brother. Applicant then \nshipped the car to Mr. O, in Nigeria. He used about $72,000 in funds that Mr. O \ndeposited in Applicant\u2019s bank account. (SOR \u00b6 2.b) \n  \nApplicant\u2019s collaboration with Mr. E in fall 2016 was not alleged under Guideline \nB (as it might have been, since AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and 7(b) would seem to apply, due to the \npotential for foreign influence, and the risk of exploitation, manipulation, or duress \nsuggested by Applicant\u2019s conduct). Instead, it was alleged under Guideline E, since \nApplicant\u2019s conduct showed highly questionable judgment, under AG \u00b6 15, the general \npersonal conduct security concern. AG \u00b6 16(e) also applies. More generally, the \u201ccatch-\nall\u201d disqualifying condition, AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) is also applicable to SOR \u00b6 2.a.  \nSOR \u00b6 2.b is more straight-forward. Applicant\u2019s cousin gave Applicant money to \nbuy a car for him in the U.S., and ship it to Nigeria, and Applicant did so. Unlike Mr. E, \nApplicant knows Mr. O quite well. They are cousins, and Applicant regards Mr. O as a \nbrother. This was also a single transaction for a specific, well-explained purpose. \nStanding alone, then, SOR \u00b6 2.b does not establish or suggest security significant \nconduct, even though Applicant\u2019s relationship with Mr. E is an independent security \nissue under Guideline B, discussed above. (SOR \u00b6 1.c) \nUnder AG \u00b6 17, conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case \ninclude: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; and \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nApplicant\u2019s purchase of a luxury auto for his cousin, Mr. O, is mitigated because, \nwhile it concerns a large amount of money, the transaction was for a specific, explained, \nand reasonable purpose, with an individual Applicant knows very well. Applicant \nindicated that he might consider buying another car for Mr. O, but such conduct would \nnot itself cast doubt on Applicant\u2019s judgment. SOR \u00b6 2.b is found in Applicant\u2019s favor. \n13 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe larger concern in this case is Applicant\u2019s interactions with Mr. E. Applicant \nengaged in numerous money transfers with multiple individuals, none of whom he ever \nmet. The transactions concerned several hundred thousand dollars, always in high \ndollar amounts. Applicant was not charged with a crime, and I cannot speculate how \nlikely any charges might have been. But it seems likely that Applicant avoided such \ncharges because he was inexperienced and naive, as he may not have recognized that \nhe was possibly engaging in criminal conduct. And even if he was not, Applicant\u2019s \ninteractions with Mr. E showed a pattern of poor judgment that is difficult to mitigate. \nApplicant now recognizes the troubling nature of his interactions with Mr. E, and \nhe has expressed regret for his conduct. He also has not engaged in subsequent \nactivity with unknown persons. AG \u00b6\u00b6 17(d) and 17(e) therefore have some application. \nHowever, he also failed to disclose the conduct during the security clearance application \nprocess until he was confronted by the interviewing agent. This lack of candor was not \nalleged, so it may not be considered as disqualifying conduct. However, it may be \nconsidered in weighing mitigation and under the whole-person concept. In that regard, \nApplicant\u2019s lack of candor to the government about this security-significant conduct \ndoes not suggest someone who has the judgment who warrants access to classified \ninformation. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments \nunder Guidelines, B and E in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nfavorable recommendations from friends and co-workers. \n14 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nApplicant \nhas \nimmediate \nand \nextended \nfamily \nmembers \nin \nNigeria. \nUnderstandably, he remains close to them. Nigeria remains a heightened risk country \nunder Guideline B for the reasons set forth in the Government\u2019s administrative notice \nfiling. Of particular concern is Applicant\u2019s pattern of engaging in money transfers with a \nNigerian relative of his wife, who he did not know. Applicant\u2019s wife facilitated his contact \nand relationship with Mr. E in late 2016, as they engaged in a series of highly suspicious \nmoney transfers. \nA security clearance applicant with a history of such activity and ongoing family \nconnections with a heightened risk country such as Nigeria has a high burden to \nestablish that resulting foreign influence and personal conduct concerns are mitigated. \nThis is particularly the case when suspicious money transfers to and from Nigeria -- the \nvery conduct Applicant engaged in -- is a specific reason why Nigeria is a heightened \nrisk country. Applicant has not met his burden of showing that the security concerns \nestablished by his conduct and his family connections to Nigeria are fully mitigated. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for access to classified information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline B: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2: Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 2.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented, it is not clearly consistent with the \ninterests of national security to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified \ninformation.

The debts consist of 3 past-due or \ncharged-off auto loans; 18 delinquent medical debts totaling about $4,200; and 7 \nmiscellaneous delinquent debts. However, the two $2,073 debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c \nand 1.x are duplicate accounts. The 6 non-duplicate miscellaneous delinquent debts \ntotal about $4,780. The debts are listed on a February 2017 credit report, a March 2019 \ncredit report, or both credit reports. \nApplicant attributed his financial problems to his divorces and an injury at work. \nHe stated that he was working 60 to 80 hours a week when he was injured in 2015. He \ndid not recover fast enough for his employer, who told him that he could resign or they \nwould let him go. He resigned. When he was able to work again, it was at an hourly rate \nthat was half of what he was earning. He moved to another state in 2016 for a job as a \nDOD civilian employee. He and his third wife lived with her parents. She kicked him out \nof the house in 2017. He left the government job in 2018 and relocated to his current \nlocation, which was essentially his home. (Tr. at 16-17, 22-25; Applicant\u2019s response to \nthe SOR; GE 1, 2) \nIn addition to the three defaulted auto loans alleged in the SOR, Applicant\u2019s \ncredit report from February 2017 lists nine paid auto loans taken out between 2009 and \n2014. The high credit on the loans was reported as ranging from $20,632 to $54,619. \nOne of the loans was a joint account; the rest were individual accounts. It is unclear how \nmany of the loans were for purchased vehicles and how many were refinanced loans on \nvehicles already owned. The credit report also lists a current joint auto loan that was \ntaken out in 2016 for about $23,703. That auto loan is reported on the March 2019 \ncredit report as paid in 2018. That credit report lists two additional auto loans: a $10,840 \nindividual auto loan that was opened in 2017, and was $656 past due; and a $15,421 \nindividual auto loan that was opened in 2019. That loan was current. Applicant stated \nthat the $10,840 loan was for a motorcycle. He stated that he became current on the \nloan, and then sold the motorcycle to his brother, who paid off the loan.1 (Tr. at 45-46; \nGE 3, 4) \nThe auto loans alleged in the SOR will be addressed in the order they were taken \nout. SOR \u00b6 1.y alleges a $985 balance due on a loan for a vehicle that had been \nrepossessed. The 2017 credit report lists it as a voluntary surrender on an individual \n1 None of the auto loans in this paragraph were alleged in the SOR, and only one of them was reported \nas past due.

Applicant stated that the vehicle was awarded to his at-the-time second wife (now \ncurrent wife) in their divorce, but she did not maintain the payments, and it was \nrepossessed. There is no evidence of any payments made toward the deficiency. (Tr. at \n26-28; Applicant\u2019s response to the SOR; GE 3, 4). \n \nApplicant and his third wife borrowed about $55,000 on an auto loan in 2014. He \nstated that the vehicle was repossessed in about 2016 after he lost his job due to an \ninjury. The deficiency balance due on the loan is about $25,000 (SOR \u00b6 1.b). Neither \nApplicant nor his third wife have made any payments toward the deficiency.

She let him use the car for the trip, but it was apparently returned to his \nthird wife. The current status of the car and the loan is uncertain. (Tr. at 28-33; \nApplicant\u2019s response to SOR; GE 2, 4) \nApplicant contracted with a credit-repair company in 2019 or early 2020 to assist \nhim in disputing items on his credit report. He stated that the company also provided \ncounseling on how to resolve his financial problems. They recommended, and he stated \nthat he is following, the \u201csnowball\u201d method of paying the smallest debts first and then \nmoving on to the next largest debt. He stated that he is paying or paid several of the \ndebts alleged in the SOR. He was informed of the importance of providing \ndocumentation, but he failed to provide any documented proof of payments, either \nduring the hearing or post-hearing. (Tr. at 16, 27, 33-43; AE A, E, F) \nApplicant stated that his wife is attempting to find a better job, and he is looking \nfor a part-time job. He stated that he and his wife both have vehicles, and they each pay \nthe loan on their vehicle. After the hearing, Applicant submitted a \u201cconsumer-debt-to-\nincome worksheet.\u201d It shows that he is paying $870 per month on a loan for a truck, with \na balance of $34,556; and $246 per month on a loan for a motorcycle, with a balance of \n$4,671. He stated that he was unable to obtain documentation of payments toward any \nof the SOR debts. (Tr.at 17, 43; AE E, G) \nApplicant submitted documents and letters attesting to his excellent job \nperformance and strong moral character. He is praised for his trustworthiness, work \nethic, generosity, honesty, professionalism, and integrity.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern for financial considerations is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant\u2019s financial history, which includes multiple delinquent debts, is sufficient \nto raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.x allege duplicate accounts. When the same conduct is \nalleged twice in the SOR under the same guideline, one of the duplicative allegations \nshould be resolved in Applicant\u2019s favor. See ISCR Case No. 03-04704 at 3 (App. Bd. \nSep. 21, 2005). SOR \u00b6 1.x is concluded for Applicant. \nThe SOR alleges 18 delinquent medical debts totaling about $4,200. The $404 \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.bb is the only medical debt that identifies the creditor. That debt \nis listed on the February 2017 credit report, but not the March 2019 credit report. I \nbelieve Applicant owes some medical debts, but I am not convinced that he owes any of \nthe specific medical debts alleged in the SOR. I am concluding all of the medical-debt \nallegations for Applicant, but I will continue to consider that Applicant owes some \nmedical debts in assessing his overall financial status and when applying mitigation. \nConditions that could mitigate the financial considerations security concerns are \nprovided under AG \u00b6 20. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast \ndoubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant contracted with a credit-repair company in 2019 or early 2020 to assist\nhim in disputing items on his credit report. He stated that he is following the \u201csnowball\u201d \nmethod of paying the smallest debts first and then moving on to the next largest debt. \nHe stated that the is paying or paid several of the debts alleged in the SOR. He was\ninformed of the importance of providing documentation, but he failed to provide any \ndocumented proof of payments, either during the hearing or post-hearing. The Appeal\nBoard has held that \u201cit is reasonable for a Judge to expect applicants to present\ndocumentation about the satisfaction of specific debts.\u201d See ISCR Case No. 09-07091\nat 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 11, 2010) (quoting ISCR Case No. 04-10671 at 3 (App. Bd.

I am unable to find that he acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances or that he made a good-faith effort to pay his \ndebts. His financial issues are recent and ongoing. They continue to cast doubt on his \ncurrent reliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. I find that the security concerns \narising out of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts are not mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. I also considered Applicant\u2019s \nfavorable character evidence. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. I conclude Applicant did not \nmitigate the financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.f: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.g-1.h: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.i-1.x: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.y-1.aa: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.bb:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIt is not clearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for \na security clearance.

Department Counsel was ready to proceed on January 22, \n2021, but scheduling of the hearing was delayed by health and safety precautions related \nto the COVID-19 pandemic. The case was assigned to me on June 2, 2021. \nOn June 15, 2021, I notified Applicant\u2019s attorney that the hearing was scheduled \nfor July 12, 2021, with the option of conducting the hearing in person or by video \nteleconference. (Hearing Exhibit I.) He opted for a video teleconference. On June 30, \n2021, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) sent Applicant\u2019s attorney a \nhearing notice setting out the details of the video teleconference. I convened the hearing \nas scheduled. Government Exhibits (GX) 1 through 4 were admitted in evidence without \nobjection. Applicant testified and submitted Applicant\u2019s Exhibits (AX) A through E, which \nwere admitted without objection. The record closed on July 12, 2021, when the hearing \nwas adjourned. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on July 20, 2021. \nAdministrative Notice \nDepartment Counsel requested that I take administrative notice of relevant facts \nabout Russia, and I did so. (GX 4.) The facts administratively noticed are set out below in \nmy findings of fact. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, she admitted the factual allegation in SOR \u00b6 1.a \nbut denied that there was any reason to question her allegiance to the United States. At \nthe hearing, Department Counsel moved to withdraw the Guideline A allegation, and I \ngranted the motion. (Tr. 8.) \nApplicant admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c. She denied the \nallegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a, 2.d, and 2.e. Her admissions in her answer and at the hearing \nare incorporated in my findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 34-year-old Russian linguist hired by a defense contractor in January \n2018. She has never held a security clearance. Her employment is contingent on her \nability to obtain a security clearance. \nWhile attending college in Russia, Applicant applied for a program that offered \npositions abroad for students or recent graduates. She testified that she lived in a very \ncold region in Siberia, found it boring, and wanted to explore other opportunities. She was \naccepted in the program and came to the United States in June 2009 on a work visa. She \nworked as an office manager from June 2009 until March 2010. \nApplicant testified that she chose to come to the United States because she spoke \nEnglish but did not speak the languages of other countries involved in the program. She \nwas required to learn English in the Russian elementary school and high school, and she \nenrolled in additional English classes in college. (Tr. 42-43.)

She \ntestified that she has become immersed in American life and culture, to the extent that \nshe now thinks in English instead of Russian. (Tr. 17.) \nApplicant married a U.S. citizen in September 2010 and became a permanent U.S. \nresident. She became a U.S. citizen in August 2014. (GX 3 at 15.) She has never formally \nrenounced her Russian citizenship, but she allowed her Russian passport to expire in \nJanuary 2014. \nApplicant and her husband separated in December 2015 and divorced in May \n2018. (Tr. 30.) She testified that they divorced because her husband was dominated by \nhis mother and preferred to stay home and watch television instead of going out and \n\u201cdoing things.\u201d (Tr. 29-30.) They do not have much contact with each other, but they \nmaintain an amicable relationship when they talk. (Tr.17.) They have no children. \nApplicant\u2019s ex-husband served on active duty in the U.S. Marine Corps for four \nyears and has been employed by DOD for 24 years. Her ex-husband submitted a letter \nsupporting her application for a security clearance. In his letter he states, \u201cDuring her time \nin the United States of America, she developed a deep love for this country. I was at her \ncitizenship ceremony; it was easy to see the pride and emotion of that day.\u201d \nIn May 2009, Applicant obtained the equivalent of a master\u2019s degree in taxation \nfrom the Siberian State Aerospace University in Russia. She received a bachelor\u2019s degree \nfrom a U.S. university in May 2017 and has been taking post-graduate courses since \nSeptember 2017. She obtained a graduate certificate in cyber security from a U.S. \nuniversity in August 2018. (Tr. 19; GX 3 at 13.) \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant\u2019s father, mother, and brother are citizens and \nresidents of Russia. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.a-2.c) It also alleges that her father formerly served as a \n\u201csecurity inspector\u201d and \u201cdistrict inspector\u201d for the Russian government (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.d), and \nthat he had provided Applicant with financial assistance of about $1,900 per month for a \ntotal of about $53,000 since December 2015 (SOR \u00b6 2.e). \nApplicant\u2019s mother lives in an apartment that she owns, worth about $16,130. Her \nfather, now deceased, owned an apartment that was also worth about $16,130 and a \ndacha (vacation house) worth about $5,645. Applicant and her brother expect to inherit \ntheir parents\u2019 property, but she intends to give her share to her brother, because she has \nno intention of living in Russia. (Tr. 37; GX 3 at 11.) During her counterintelligence \nscreening interview, she commented, \u201cRussia is a wonderful country with a horrible \ngovernment.\u201d (GX 3 at 3.) \nApplicant\u2019s father passed away in July 2018. (AX A.) He had worked for the \nRussian government from 1980 to1995, and he received a pension for his service. (GX 3 \nat 16.)

She \ndid not receive any benefits from the Russian government for her father\u2019s former service. \n(Tr. 33-34.) \nIn Applicant\u2019s SCA, she stated that she has daily telephone contact with her \nmother. Her mother has been employed for about 15 years by a sportsmanship institute \nthat trains and educates athletes. (Tr. 35.) She is not affiliated with the Russian \ngovernment, military security, defense industry, or intelligence service. (GX 1 at 28.) In \nher answer to the SOR, she stated that she has \u201cvery little\u201d verbal contact with her mother, \nabout five times a year. However, at the hearing, she testified that they text \u201cevery week, \ntwo times a week, sometimes every day of the week depending on [her] mom\u2019s mood and \nsituation.\u201d (Tr. 21.) \nIn Applicant\u2019s SCA, she stated that she had weekly telephone contact with her \nbrother. Her brother is employed by as an electrical engineer for a construction company. \n(Tr. 36.) He has no affiliation with the Russian government, military, security, defense-\nrelated industry, or intelligence service. (GX 1 at 30-31.) In Applicant\u2019s answer to the \nSOR, she stated that she has little contact with her brother and has not seen him for about \nfive years. However, at the hearing, she testified that she and her brother send texts every \ntwo or three months and talk on the telephone once every two or three months. (Tr. 21.) \nApplicant\u2019s SCA reflects that she visited her family in Russia in October 2011, \nDecember 2013, and March 2015. (GX 1 at 36-41.) Since 2016, she has been sending \nher mother $100 for Christmas or her birthday. (GX 3 at 10.) At the hearing, she testified \nthat she and her mother vacationed together in Europe in November 2019, but she has \nnot seen her brother since she went to Russia in 2015. (Tr. 22-23.) \nApplicant testified that her brother approves of her decision to become a U.S. \ncitizen and live in the United States. However, her mother disapproves because she \nbelieves that a daughter should stay at home and support her parents. (Tr. 25.) \nApplicant was unemployed and supported by her husband during their marriage, \nexcept for employment as a waitress in a bar from December 2011 to January 2012. She \nwas self-employed as an artist from January to December 2017, when she was offered a \nposition as a Russian linguist, contingent on obtaining a security clearance. \nIn July 2018, Applicant accepted an invitation from an acquaintance to invest in a \nused-car dealership. She borrowed money from her credit union and used credit cards to \ninvest about $100,000 in a 50% interest in the business. She owes about $32,000 on the \nloan. She lived in a home owned by her husband during their marriage, but she currently \ndoes not own a home or any other investment interests. (Tr. 39.) \nApplicant testified that the used-car business is doing well in spite of COVID-19. \nLast year, she earned about $45,000. She actively works in the business six days a week, \nselling cars, dealing with banks, dealing with clients, and every aspect of the business. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nA business owner, who is also an ordained minister, trusts and respects Applicant. \nHe describes her as dedicated, hardworking, and a \u201cwoman of refreshing candor.\u201d (AX E \nat 2.)

(Tr. 41.) \nI have taken administrative notice that Russia is one of the top three most \naggressive collectors of economic information and technological intelligence from U.S. \nsources. Russia uses cyber operations as an instrument of intelligence collection, using \nsophisticated and large-scale hacking to collect sensitive information, influence the \npolitical process in the United States, and undermine Euro-Atlantic unity. \nRussia also uses commercial and academic enterprises that interact with the West, \nrecruitment of Russian immigrants with advanced technical skills, and penetration of \npublic and private enterprises by Russian intelligence agents to obtain sensitive technical \ninformation. The areas of highest interest include alternative energy, biotechnology, \ndefense technology, environmental protection, high-end manufacturing, and information \nand communications technology. Russian agents have been involved in intrusions \naffecting U.S. citizens, corporate entities, international organizations, and political \norganizations in the United States. \nSignificant human-rights issues in Russia include extrajudicial killings; enforced \ndisappearance; torture, including punitive psychiatric incarceration; harsh prison \nconditions; arbitrary arrest and detention; and lack of judicial independence. The \nDepartment of State has identified Moscow as a high-threat location for terrorist activity \ndirected at official U.S. Government interests. \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law.

An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2016).  \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd.

Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual maybe manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \n \nGuideline B is not limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United\nStates has a compelling interest in protecting and safeguarding classified information\nfrom any person, organization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it,\nregardless of whether that person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those\nof the United States.\u201d ISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd.

Mar. 29, 2002). Finally, we know friendly \nnations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in the economic, \nscientific, and technical fields. \nNevertheless, the nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United \nStates, and its human-rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an \napplicant\u2019s family members are vulnerable to government coercion. The risk of coercion, \npersuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an authoritarian \ngovernment, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the government, or \nthe country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the United States. In \nconsidering the nature of the government, an administrative judge must also consider any \nterrorist activity in the country at issue. See generally ISCR Case No. 02-26130 at 3 (App. \nBd. Dec. 7, 2006).  \nThe following disqualifying conditions under this guideline are relevant: \nAG \u00b6 7(a): contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, \nbusiness or professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen \nof or resident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk \nof foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; \nAG \u00b6 7(b): connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country \nthat create a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation \nto protect classified or sensitive information or technology and the \nindividual's desire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing \nthat information or technology; and \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 7(f): substantial business, financial, or property interests in a foreign\ncountry, or in any foreign owned or foreign-operated business that could\nsubject the individual to a heightened risk of foreign influence or exploitation\nor personal conflict of interest. \n \nAG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and (f) require substantial evidence of a \u201cheightened risk.\u201d The \n\u201cheightened risk\u201d required to raise one of these disqualifying conditions is a relatively low \nstandard. \u201cHeightened risk\u201d denotes a risk greater than the normal risk inherent in having \na family member living under a foreign government. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 12-05839 \nat 4 (App. Bd. Jul. 11, 2013). \u201cHeightened risk\u201d is not a high standard. See, e.g., ISCR \nCase No.17-03026 at 5 (App. Bd. Jan. 16, 2019). It is a level of risk one step above a \nState Department Level 1 travel advisory (\u201cexercise normal precaution\u201d) and equivalent \nto a Level 2 advisory (\u201cexercise increased caution\u201d). \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe totality of an applicant\u2019s family ties to a foreign country as well as each \nindividual family tie must be considered. ISCR Case No. 01-22693 at 7 (App. Bd. Sep. \n22, 2003). Applicants with family members in a hostile country have a \u201cvery heavy burden\u201d \nof persuasion to show that their connections to that country do not pose a threat to U.S. \nsecurity. ISCR Case No. 19-00831 (App. Bd. Jul. 29, 2020).  \nApplicant\u2019s family ties to her mother and brother are sufficient to establish AG \u00b6 \n7(a) and the potential conflict of interest in AG \u00b6 7(b). However, Applicant\u2019s potential \ninheritance of her parents\u2019 property is not sufficient to establish AG \u00b6 7(f). Because of the \nuncertainties surrounding the expectancy of an inheritance, an applicant does not have a \nfinancial stake in a country merely because he or she may inherit real or personal property \nat some time in the future from a parent who currently resides in that country. ISCR Case \nNo 97-0403 at 3 (App. Bd. May 13, 1998). \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 8(a): the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country \nin which these persons are located, or the positions or activities of those \npersons in that country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed \nin a position of having to choose between the interests of a foreign \nindividual, group, organization, or government and the interests of the \nUnited States;  \nAG \u00b6 8(b): there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s \nsense of loyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the \ngroup, government, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep \nand longstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest; and \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 8(c): contact or communication with foreign citizens is so casual and \ninfrequent that there is little likelihood that it could create a risk for foreign \ninfluence or exploitation. \nAG \u00b6 8(a) is not established. Russia is a hostile country. Applicant has not met her \nvery heavy burden of showing that she is not likely to be placed in a position of having to \nchoose between the interests of her family members and the interests of the United \nStates. \nAG \u00b6 8(b) is not established. Applicant has a strong emotional attachment to the \nUnited States, but she has no immediate family members, close friends, or business \nconnections in the United States, except for her current partner in the used-car business. \nShe was unemployed and supported by her husband during their marriage. She has no \nother employment record except for her brief employment as a business manager from \nJune 2009 to March 2010 and employment as a waitress in a bar from December 2011 \nto January 2012. She does not own a home or have any other financial investments in \nthe United States. Her only financial connection to the United States is her joint ownership \nof a used-car dealership. \nAG \u00b6 8(c) is not established. Applicant has given inconsistent information about \nthe frequency of contacts with her mother and brother. In her SCA, she stated that she \nhas daily telephone contact with her mother. In her answer to the SOR, she stated that \nshe has \u201cvery little\u201d verbal contact with her mother, about five times a year. However, at \nthe hearing, she testified that they text \u201cevery week, two times a week, sometimes every \nday of the week depending on [her] mom\u2019s mood and situation, and that she and her \nmother traveled to Europe together in 2019. In her SCA, she stated that she had weekly \ntelephone contact with her brother, but in her answer to the SOR, she stated that she has \nlittle contact with her brother and has not seen him for about five years. At the hearing, \nshe testified that she and her brother send texts every two or three months and talk on \nthe telephone once every two or three months. \nIt appears that Applicant tried to minimize her contacts with her mother and brother \nin her answer to the SOR, but admitted frequent contacts in her SCA and at the hearing. \nNevertheless, even if Applicant\u2019s contacts were infrequent, she has not overcome the \npresumption that they are not casual. See ISCR Case No. 00-0484 at 5 (App. Bd. Feb. 1, \n2002). \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances. An administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process \nfactors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline B in my whole-person analysis \nand applied the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant was candid and sincere at the \nhearing, and her emotional attachment to the United States appears genuine. However, \nthat emotional attachment is not backed up with relationships and loyalties in the United \nStates sufficient to carry her very heavy burden of persuasion. After weighing the \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline B, and evaluating all the evidence \nin the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has not mitigated the security \nconcerns raised by her family connections to Russia. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline A  \n(Allegiance to the United States): \nWITHDRAWN \nSubparagraph 1a:  \nWithdrawn \nParagraph 2, Guideline B (Foreign Influence): \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a, 2.d, and 2.e:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 2.b and 2.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to grant Applicant eligibility for access to classified information.

Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within \nIndustry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \n4 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and Director of National Intelligence have established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of disproving a \nmitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, \non the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes two disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern \nand may be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of \nnot meeting financial obligations.\u201d In ISCR Case No. 08-12184 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 7, \n2010), the Appeal Board explained: \nIt is well-settled that adverse information from a credit report can normally \nmeet the substantial evidence standard and the government\u2019s obligations \nunder [Directive] \u00b6 E3.1.14 for pertinent allegations. At that point, the burden \nshifts to applicant to establish either that [he or] she is not responsible for \nthe debt or that matters in mitigation apply. \n(internal citation omitted). The record establishes the disqualifying conditions in AG \u00b6\u00b6 \n19(a) and 19(c) requiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating \nconditions. \nFive financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b).  \nThe SOR alleges six delinquent debts totaling $24,152. Circumstances beyond his \ncontrol adversely affected his finances, including unemployment and failure of his sister \nto keep a joint account current. However, he did not show that he acted responsibly under \nthe circumstances. \u201cEven if Applicant\u2019s financial difficulties initially arose, in whole or in \npart, due to circumstances outside his [or her] control, the Judge could still consider \nwhether Applicant has since acted in a reasonable manner when dealing with those \nfinancial difficulties.\u201d ISCR Case No. 05-11366 at 4 n.9 (App. Bd. Jan. 12, 2007) (citing \nISCR Case No. 99-0462 at 4 (App. Bd. May 25, 2000); ISCR Case No. 99-0012 at 4 (App. \nBd. Dec. 1, 1999); ISCR Case No. 03-13096 at 4 (App. Bd. Nov. 29, 2005)). A component \nis whether he or she maintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial \npayments to keep debts current. Applicant did not provide documentary evidence that he \nmaintained contact with creditors and attempted to negotiate partial payments to keep \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c current. \nApplicant is credited with mitigating SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f. He paid these three \ndebts. The debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c remain for resolution. A debt that became \ndelinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, \nunpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, therefore, can be viewed as \nrecent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d ISCR Case No. 15-06532 \nat 3 (App. Bd.

July 7, 2016) (citing ISCR Case No. 14-03612 at 3 (App. Bd. Aug. 25, 2015)). The \nFair Credit Reporting Act requires removal of most negative financial items from a credit \nreport seven years from the first date of delinquency or the debt becoming collection \nbarred because of a state statute of limitations, whichever is longer. See Title 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1681c. See Federal Trade Commission website, Summary of Fair Credit Reporting Act \nUpdates at Section 605, https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0111-fair-credit-\nreporting-act.pdf.

Oct. 15, 2007) (internal citation omitted) \n(mitigating security concerns despite garnishment to pay debt because of other financial \nefforts), the Appeal Board explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [this mitigating condition] an applicant \nmust present evidence showing either a good faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or some other good faith action aimed at resolving the applicant\u2019s \ndebts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood faith.\u201d However, the \nBoard has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires a showing that \na person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, prudence, honesty, and \nadherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an applicant must do more \nthat show that he or she relied on a legally available option (such as \nbankruptcy [or the statute of limitations]) in order to claim the benefit of \n[these mitigating conditions]. \nApplicant did not provide a personal financial statement or budget. He did not \nprove that he was unable to address or make greater progress on his three unresolved \nSOR debts. He received some financial counseling; however, Applicant did not provide \nsufficient documentation relating to the SOR debts in \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c, such as: (1) \nproof of payments, for example, checking account statements, photocopies of checks, or \na letter from the creditor proving that he paid or made any payments to the creditor; (2) \ncorrespondence to or from the creditor to establish maintenance of contact; (3) copies of \ncredible debt disputes sent to the creditor and/or credit reporting companies indicating he \ndid not believe he was responsible for the debt and why he held such a belief; (4) evidence \nof attempts to negotiate payment plans, for example, settlement offers or agreements to \nshow that he was attempting to resolve a debt; or (5) other evidence of progress or \nresolution. \nApplicant said he planned to pay or resolve the debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c. \nHe did not indicate how much money he was saving each month to resolve the three \ndebts, or when he planned to make a new settlement offer on any of the debts.

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is 32 years old, and he has been continuously employed as a technician \nsince February 2016. He was unemployed from May 2015 to February 2016. He served \nin the Air Force from March 2009 to May 2015. He received two Air Force Achievement \nmedals for service while he was deployed. He left active duty as an E-5, and he received \na medical separation and an honorable discharge. There is no evidence of workplace \nmisconduct, abuse of alcohol, use of illegal drugs, or criminal conduct. He did not provide \ncopies of performance evaluations or character-reference statements. \nApplicant provided important financial mitigating information. His finances were \nharmed by several circumstances beyond his control. He paid the three SOR debts in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, and 1.f. He paid several other non-SOR debts, and several accounts \nare current. \nThe evidence against grant of a security clearance is more substantial. Applicant \ndid not provide documentation about why he was unable to make greater documented \nprogress resolving the three delinquent SOR debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.c, totaling \n$21,663. He did not give a clear indication of when he planned to pay or make a significant \nattempt to pay the three unresolved debts. There is no documentary evidence of progress \n(payments or payment plans) on these three debts. His lack of responsible financial action \nraises unmitigated questions about Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information.

This decision should not be construed as a \ndetermination that Applicant cannot or will not attain the state of reform necessary for \naward of a security clearance in the future. With more effort towards documented \nresolution of his past-due debts, and a track record of behavior consistent with his \nobligations, he may well be able to demonstrate persuasive evidence of his security \nclearance worthiness. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec.

The \nSOR recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether such \neligibility should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nIn a sworn but undated statement, Applicant responded to the SOR, and she \nrequested a hearing before an administrative judge. Department Counsel indicated the \nGovernment was prepared to proceed on June 29, 2020. Because of the COVID-19 \nPandemic protocols, further processing of the matter was suspended until such time that \nit could resume. The case was assigned to me on July 2, 2021. A Notice of Defense \nCollaboration Services (DCS) Video Teleconference Hearing was issued on August 17, \n2021. I convened the hearing as scheduled on August 27, 2021. \nDuring the hearing, Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2 were admitted into evidence \nwithout objection. Applicant testified. The transcript (Tr.) was received on September 3, \n2021. Because Applicant had failed to submit her documents to Department Counsel \nbefore the hearing commenced, they were marked, but not admitted, until Department \nCounsel had the opportunity to review them. Applicant Exhibits (AE) A through AE E were \nsubsequently admitted without objection. I kept the record open until September 8, 2021, \nto enable her to supplement it. Applicant chose not to submit any further documents. The \nrecord closed on September 8, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nIn her Answer to the SOR, Applicant denied, with brief comments, all of the factual \nallegations pertaining to financial considerations (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a. and 1.b.). Applicant\u2019s \ncomments are incorporated herein to compare with my findings of fact. After a complete \nand thorough review of the evidence in the record, and upon due consideration of same, \nI make the following findings of fact: \nBackground \nApplicant is a 51-year-old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving \nwith her current employer as a claims customer services advocate or claims associate \nsince December 2006. At times, she has also been a part-time employee of other \ncommercial stores. The recipient of a General Educational Development (GED) diploma \nin 1989, she received an associate\u2019s degree in 2003 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2005. \nShe has never served with the U.S. military.

The actual legal status of her most recent marital relationship is not known to \nher. She has two children, born in 1989 and 1991. \n2 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant failed to timely file her federal and state income tax returns for the tax \nyears 2017 and 2018. On June 25, 2018, she was interviewed by an investigator with the\nU.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM). During that interview, she admitted that\nshe failed to timely file her 2017 income tax returns, essentially claiming that she was\nunable to do so because she could not find the paperwork to enable her to itemize her\nmedical bills and student loans. She added that her employer was laying off employees\nand because of the uncertainty of her own job, she simply set her taxes aside. After\nmissing the filing deadline for the 2017 income tax returns, she became nervous about\nfiling the 2018 income tax returns. She subsequently learned that her failure to file the\nincome tax returns for an earlier year did not prevent her from filing the tax returns for\nlater years. She planned on completing her trustworthiness eligibility process before\ntaking on her income tax issues, but intended to file her income tax returns within 90 days.\n(GE 2, at 5, 10) As of February 11, 2020, she had still not filed her delinquent income tax\nreturns. (GE 2, at 10) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUsing the professional services of a tax return preparation service, Applicant \nelectronically filed her federal and state income tax returns for 2018 on April 27, 2020, \nthree days after the SOR was issued. (AE A; AE B) Her federal income tax return for 2017 \nwas electronically filed the following day, four days after the SOR was issued; and the \nstate income tax return was electronically filed on April 29, 2020, five days after the SOR \nwas issued. (AE A; AE B) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a [position of public trust].\u201d (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988)) As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information. The President has \nauthorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant an applicant eligibility for \naccess to such information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the national \ninterest to do so.\u201d The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense (Counterintelligence and \nSecurity) Memorandum, dated November 14, 2004, indicates trustworthiness \nadjudications will apply to cases forwarded to DOHA. ADP I (critical-sensitive positions) \nand ADP II (non-critical sensitive positions) constitute such cases.  \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the guidelines in SEAD 4. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility \nfor a public trust position. \nAn administrative judge need not view the guidelines as inflexible, ironclad rules \nof law. Instead, acknowledging the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \n3 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \napplied in conjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a meaningful decision. \nIn the decision-making process, facts must be established by \u201csubstantial \nevidence.\u201d \u201cSubstantial evidence [is] such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might \naccept as adequate to support a conclusion in light of all contrary evidence in the record.\u201d \n(ISCR Case No. 04-11463 at 2 (App. Bd. Aug. 4, 2006) (citing Directive \u00b6 E3.1.32.1)) \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  (See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994)) \nThe Government initially has the burden of producing evidence to establish a \npotentially disqualifying condition under the Directive, and has the burden of establishing \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Once the Government has produced substantial \nevidence of a disqualifying condition, under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant has the \nburden of persuasion to present evidence in refutation, explanation, extenuation or \nmitigation, sufficient to overcome the doubts raised by the Government\u2019s case. The \nburden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR \nCase No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005)) \nA person who seeks access to sensitive information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours as well. It is \nbecause of this special relationship that the Government must be able to repose a high \ndegree of trust and confidence in those individuals to whom it grants access to sensitive \ninformation. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. Such \ndecisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, rather \nthan actual, risk of compromise of sensitive information. Furthermore, \u201csecurity clearance \ndeterminations, and by inference, public trust determinations, should err, if they must, on \nthe side of denials.\u201d (Egan, 484 U.S. at 531) In reaching this decision, I have drawn only \nthose conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained in \nthe record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere speculation \nor conjecture. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations \nis set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \n4 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes a condition that could raise trustworthiness concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19: \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant failed to file her federal and state income tax returns for the tax years\n2017 and 2018. As of April 24, 2020, the date the SOR was issued, none of those income \ntax returns had been filed. In fact, Applicant has conceded that they were not filed until \nApril 27th, April 28th, or April 29th, 2020, several days after the SOR was issued, and \nnearly two years after she was interviewed by the OPM investigator.  AG \u00b6 19(f) has been \nestablished.  \n \nThe guideline also includes examples of conditions that could mitigate security \nconcerns arising from financial difficulties under AG \u00b6 20: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual=s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person=s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nAG \u00b6 20(g) applies, but none of the other mitigating conditions apply. The nature, \nfrequency, and recency of Applicant\u2019s failure to voluntarily and timely resolve those \ndelinquent federal and state income tax issues for several years, despite her promises to \ndo so within 90 days after her June 2018 OPM interview, make it rather easy to conclude \n5 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nthat those issues were not infrequent. Applicant attributed her failure to timely file her \nincome tax returns to being unable to find necessary paperwork to enable her to itemize \nher medical bills and student loans; the fact that her employer was laying off employees \nand she was uncertain of her own job, so she simply set her taxes aside; and after missing \nthe filing deadline for the 2017 income tax returns, she became nervous about filing the \n2018 income tax returns. Those factors were not beyond her control, and she failed to act \nresponsibly under the circumstances. \nAn applicant who begins to resolve his or her financial problems only after being \nplaced on notice that his or her public trust position is in jeopardy may be lacking in the \njudgment and self-discipline to follow rules and regulations over time or when there is no \nimmediate threat to his or her own interests. (See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 17-01213 at 5 \n(App. Bd. Jun. 29, 2018); ISCR Case No. 17-00569 at 3-4 (App. Bd. Sept. 18, 2018). \nApplicant completed her SF 86 in May 2018; underwent her OPM interview in June \n2018; completed her responses to the interrogatories in February 2020; and the SOR was \nissued in April 2020. Each step of the trustworthiness review process placed her on notice \nof the significance of the financial issues confronting her. With respect to her unfiled \nfederal and state income tax returns, there is evidence that Applicant took no action to \nresolve any of those issues for nearly two years after her OPM interview. She finally filed \nthose delinquent income tax returns within days of the SOR being issued, but it remains \nunclear if she did so before or after the SOR was received by her. By failing to timely file \nher income tax returns, she did not demonstrate the high degree of good judgment and \nreliability required of those granted eligibility to a public trust position. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has observed: \nFailure to file tax returns suggests that an applicant has a problem with \ncomplying with well-established governmental rules and systems. Voluntary \ncompliance with such rules and systems is essential for protecting \n[sensitive] information. ISCR Case No. 01-05340 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 20, \n2002). As we have noted in the past, a [public trust] adjudication is not \ndirected at collecting debts. See, e.g., ISCR Case No. 07-08049 at 5 (App. \nBd. Jul. 22, 2008). By the same token, neither is it directed toward inducing \nan applicant to file tax returns. Rather, it is a proceeding aimed at evaluating \nan applicant\u2019s judgment and reliability. Id. A person who fails repeatedly to \nfulfill his or her legal obligations does not demonstrate the high degree of \ngood judgment and reliability required of those granted access to [sensitive] \ninformation.

(See \nISCR Case No. 15-01031 at 3 and note 3 (App. Bd. June 15, 2016) (characterizing \u201cno \nharm, no foul\u201d approach to an Applicant\u2019s course of conduct and employment of an \u201call\u2019s \nwell that ends well\u201d analysis as inadequate to support approval of access to [a public trust \nposition] with focus on the timing of filing tax returns). \nApplicant\u2019s actions, or inaction, under the circumstances cast doubt on her current \nreliability, trustworthiness, and good judgment. (See ISCR Case No. 09-08533 at 3-4 \n(App. Bd. Oct. 6, 2010).) \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of public trust by considering the totality of the \napplicant\u2019s conduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider \nthe nine adjudicative process factors listed at SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \neligibility for a position of public trust must be an overall commonsense judgment based \nupon careful consideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Moreover, I \nhave evaluated the various aspects of this case in light of the totality of the record \nevidence and have not merely performed a piecemeal analysis. (See U.S. v. Bottone, 365 \nF.2d 389, 392 (2d Cir. 1966); See also ISCR Case No. 03-22861 at 2-3 (App. Bd. Jun. 2, \n2006)) \nThere is some evidence in favor of mitigating Applicant\u2019s trustworthiness concerns. \nApplicant is a 51-year old employee of a defense contractor. She has been serving with \nher current employer as a claims customer services advocate or claims associate since \nDecember 2006. At times, she has also been a part-time employee of other commercial \nstores. The recipient of a GED diploma in 1989, she received an associate\u2019s degree in \n2003 and a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2005. She finally filed her delinquent income tax returns \nfor the tax years 2017 and 2018 in late April 2020. \n7 \n\n \n \n                                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                        \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nThe disqualifying evidence under the whole-person concept is simply more \nsubstantial. Applicant failed to timely file federal and state income tax returns for the tax \nyears 2017 and 2018. Despite her promises to do so within 90 days after her June 2018 \nOPM interview, as of the date the SOR was issued on April 24 2020, none of those income \ntax returns had actually been filed. \nOverall, the evidence leaves me with substantial questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a position of public trust. For all of these reasons, \nI conclude Applicant has failed to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns arising from her \nfinancial considerations. See SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) (1) through AG 2(d) (9). \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a. and 1.b.: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a position of \npublic trust to support a contract with the DOD.  Eligibility is denied. \nROBERT ROBINSON GALES \nAdministrative Judge \n8 \n",

He explained that he was having financial problems, and he pawned the \nitems, but could not provide the name of the pawnshop. On March 16, 2018, Company \nA discharged Applicant from employment for \u201cviolating his duty to protect the assets of \nCompany A and those assets entrusted to Company A.\u201d Applicant signed a document \nagreeing to have the value of the stolen items deducted from his final paycheck. (GE 3; \nAE B) In pertinent part, the agreement stated: \nI, [Applicant\u2019s initials], acknowledge a debt of $3,350.00 owed to \n[Company A] incurred as a result of my admitted misappropriation of \ncertain IT equipment including three iPads (valued at $2,850.00), two \ncomputer monitors (valued at $400.00), and one digital camera (valued at \n$100.00) (AE B) \nCompany A acknowledged that Applicant\u2019s act of misappropriation is the only adverse \naction he committed during his 16-year tenure. He did not have a history of disciplinary \nproblems. (GE 3) \nA year later, in April 2019, a background investigator conducted an enhanced \nsubject interview with Applicant in connection with his January 2019 security clearance \napplication. During the interview, Applicant discussed his discharge from Company A. \nAccording to the statement, Applicant admitted that he stole two iPads, photography \nequipment, and a camera, which he sold to a pawnshop for $200. Applicant told the \nbackground investor that he was not coerced into stealing the equipment. He admitted \nthat it was an irresponsible decision. He further explained that the equipment was old \nand that he thought no one would miss it. (GE 2) \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted taking only the three iPads. He \ndenied taking the monitors or a camera from Company A. He also denied selling any of \nCompany A\u2019s assets to a pawnshop. \nAt the hearing, Applicant denied misappropriating or stealing any equipment from \nCompany A. He testified that in his position, he was authorized to take equipment from \nthe supply closet and transport it in his private vehicle to sites around the local area to \ncomplete his assigned projects. He admitted taking the three iPads, but he claimed that \none never left Company A property, and that he took the other two tablets home to \nfacilitate his ability to telework. Applicant testified that he admitted to the theft after \nbeing confronted by the Company A investigators, because he felt as if he was not \ngiven an opportunity to explain himself. He also stated that he did not tell Company A \ninvestigators that he sold the missing items to a pawn shop, but that the investigator \nmade it up. He also denied telling the background investigator that he pawned the \nstolen items. He denied his previous admissions of financial problems to Company A \ninvestigators. Applicant testified that he is financially stable and has never experienced \nfinancial problems.

(Tr. 31-36) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n Analysis \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                          \n \n \n \nThe SOR alleges disqualifying conduct under the criminal conduct and personal \nconduct guidelines. The government has established a prima facie case under each. \nThe evidence supports the finding that Applicant stole Company A assets valued at \n$3,330 and pawned them for $200. Potentially disqualifying conduct under both \nguidelines raises concerns about an individual\u2019s judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, \nor unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations, and ultimately concerns about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation. (See AG \u00b6 15 and AG \u00b6 30) Specifically, the following disqualifying \nconditions apply: \nPersonal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 16(g): Violation of a written or recorded commitment made by an \nindividual to the employer as a condition of employment; and, \nCriminal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 31(b) Evidence . . . of criminal conduct, regardless of whether the \nindividual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted.  \nThe relevant mitigating condition under both guidelines, AG \u00b6 17(c) and AG \u00b6 32 \n(a), share similar language, focusing on the significance and recency of the misconduct, \nthe circumstances under which the misconduct occurred, the likelihood of recurrence, \nand the continued impact of the misconduct of the applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, \nor good judgment. Even though Applicant engaged in single act of misconduct and the \ndollar value was not large, his conduct is not insignificant or minor. When confronted \nwith a conflict of interest between duty to his employer and his personal circumstances, \nhe resolved the conflicts in his self-interest. \nBased on the record, I have significant reservations about Applicant\u2019s ongoing \nsecurity worthiness. In reaching this conclusion, I have also considered the whole-\nperson factors at AG \u00b6 2(d). The record supports a negative whole-person assessment. \nIn his testimony at hearing, Applicant made multiple conflicting statements about the \nnature of his misconduct. Based on Applicant\u2019s statements he provided incriminating, \nbut false statements to his former employer during an investigation into his alleged \nmisconduct and again to a background investigator in connection with his security \nclearance. The truthful statements he claims to have made at the hearing provide an \nalternate version of events that defies belief, all raising more questions and concerns \nApplicant\u2019s ongoing security worthiness. \nThe purpose of the security clearance adjudication is to make \u201can examination of \na sufficient period of a person\u2019s life to make an affirmative determination that the person \nis an acceptable security risk.\u201d1 Despite having a clearance for more than 30 years, \n1 AG \u00b6 2(d). \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nApplicant has engaged in conduct that shows he no longer possesses the good \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness required of individual\u2019s with access to classified \ninformation.

His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my findings of fact. Applicant is a 32-year-old engineering technician employed by a defense contractor since February 2009. He was unemployed for about three months before being hired for his current position. He attended various educational institutions from August 2007 to September 2018 but did not receive a degree. He has never married. He has a four-year-old daughter for whom he pays child support. He received a security clearance in December 2014.

Government Exhibits (GX) 1 \nthrough 5 were admitted in evidence without objection.

I held the record open until January 8, 2021, to enable \nhim to submit additional documentary evidence. At his request, I extended the deadline \nto January 29, 2021. He timely submitted AX G, H, and I, which were admitted without \nobjection. DOHA received the transcript (Tr.) on January 6, 2021. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, he admitted all the allegations, with \nexplanations. His admissions in his answer and at the hearing are incorporated in my \nfindings of fact. \nApplicant is a 32-year-old engineering technician employed by a defense \ncontractor since February 2009. He was unemployed for about three months before being \nhired for his current position. He attended various educational institutions from August \n2007 to September 2018 but did not receive a degree. He has never married. He has a \nfour-year-old daughter for whom he pays child support. He received a security clearance \nin December 2014. \nThe SOR alleges 15 delinquent debts, of which 8 are student loans. The delinquent \ndebts are reflected in credit reports from March 2019 and September 2019. (GX 3; GX \n4.) The evidence concerning these debts is summarized below. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e, 1.g, 1.n, and 1.o: student loans totaling about $34,848. The \nstudent loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.d were opened in August 2008. The student \nloan alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.g was opened in September 2011. The student loans alleged in \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.d were opened in October 2011. The student loan alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.e was opened in July 2012. Applicant fell behind on his student loans in April 2017 \nbecause he could not afford to pay them and keep up with his child-support payments of \n$600 per month. At the time, he was earning about $41,000 per year. (Tr. 60-61.) His pay \nwas garnished and the loans were brought up to date in November 2017.  \nThe loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.n and 1.o were referred for collection in February \n2018. (GX 4 at 1-2.) The loans alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.e and 1.g were referred for \ncollection in April 2018. (GX 3 at 5-6.) Applicant stopped attending college courses in \nSeptember 2018 without obtaining a degree, and he began working full time because he \ndid not want to incur any more student loans. (Tr. 27-28.) \nApplicant disclosed his delinquent student loans and the other debts alleged in the \nSOR when he submitted his SCA in February 2019. He paid $1,125 in March 2019 to \nbring one of his loans up to date, and he was questioned about them by a security \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninvestigator in April 2019. (GX 2 at 4.) As of November 2019, he was making payments \nof about $150 per month on two consolidated student loans totaling about $15,714. \n(Answer at 17.) \nIn February 2020, Applicant applied for consolidation of all his student loans. All \nhis student loans now have been consolidated into four loans totaling $33,424, all of which \nare in forbearance. (Tr. 21-22; AX A.) He anticipates that he will be paying a total of about \n$212 per month after the period of forbearance ends. (Tr. 36.) He has received pay raises \nevery year and is financially able to make the payments when the forbearance ends. His \nannual pay increased to $55,000 in 2018, and in December 2019, it increased to $75,000 \nper year. (Tr. 60-61.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.f: charge account charged off for $627. Applicant incurred this debt to \nbuy a desk in January 2013. His last payment was in May 2013. (Tr. 38; GX 4 at 2.) In his \nanswer and at the hearing, he stated that he had contacted the collection agency and \noriginal creditor, and they informed him that they had charged off the debt and will not \naccept a payment. (Tr. 22, 39; Answer at 1.) He contacted the original creditor and was \ninformed that an IRS Form 1099-C, reflecting the cancellation of the debt, would be sent \nwithin 15 days. At the time of the hearing, he was waiting for the IRS Form 1099-C. (Tr. \n67.) After the hearing, he contacted the creditor again and was informed that that he \nwould receive the IRS Form 1099-C by January 16, 2021. When he did not receive it, he \ncontacted the creditor a third time and was informed that the document had not been sent \nbecause they could not verify his address. Documentation of his repeated contacts with \nthe creditor is attached to the record as AX I. I am satisfied that the debt was cancelled. \nSOR \u00b6 1.h: credit-card account charged off for $133. Applicant opened this \naccount in December 2015 to build his credit, and he made payments until August 2016. \nThe debt was charged off in January 2017. (GX 3 at 6; Tr. 40.) In February 2020, he \nsettled the debt for $80.26. (Answer at 12; Tr. 41.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.i: delinquent rent payments referred for collection of $3,892. This \ndebt was incurred April 2016, when Applicant moved out of an apartment without giving \n60 days\u2019 notice. (GX 2 at 4.) His monthly rent had been $1,000. The landlord increased \nthe rent to $1,500 and demanded payment for the equivalent of two months\u2019 rent at the \nincreased rate. The debt was referred for collection in June 2016. (GX 3 at 11.) Applicant \nmade monthly payments of $252 for about a year and then settled the debt in January \n2020 for $1,557. (Answer at 13; GX 2 at 4; AX E; Tr. 45.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.j: debt to insurance company referred for collection of $984. This \ndebt was incurred when Applicant sold a vehicle but neglected to cancel the insurance. \nThe debt was referred for collection in January 2016. (GX 3 at 11.) In February 2020, he \nmade an agreement to pay $984 in four installments. (Answer at 15.) He complied with \nhis agreement, and the debt has been resolved. (Tr. 22; AX B and C.) \n3 \nSOR \u00b6 1.k: delinquent medical debt for $636. In Applicant\u2019s answer to the SOR, \nhe stated that he was unaware of this debt and was not sure of its origin.

(GX 3 at 12; Answer at 5.) Applicant \nbelieves that this debt may have been for treatment after an automobile accident. He \ncontacted the hospital where he was treated, but the hospital was unable to provide him \nany information about the debt. (Tr. 23.) I have resolved this debt for Applicant, because \nthe SOR does not provide the specificity required by Directive \u00b6 E3.1.3. It does not provide \nthe name of the original creditor or the collection agency, making it virtually impossible \nfor him to investigate or resolve the debt. \nSOR \u00b6 1.l: telecommunications account referred for collection of $595. This \nwas incurred when Applicant failed to return cable equipment in 2014. (Tr. 48.) The debt \nis reflected in the March 2019 credit report (GX 3 at 12) but not the November 2019 credit \nreport. (GX 4.) Applicant contacted the original creditor and the collection agency in an \neffort to resolve the debt. The collection agency informed him that they had returned the \ndebt to the original creditor. He testified that he tried to contact the original creditor but \ncould not get beyond the telephone menus and talk to a \u201clive person.\u201d (Tr. 49.) \nSOR \u00b6 1.m: debt to insurance company referred for collection of $260. \nApplicant testified that this debt was incurred after an insured vehicle was totaled, but he \ncould not remember the specific circumstances that caused this delinquent debt. (Tr. 51.). \nIt was referred for collection in November 2017. (GX 3 at 12.) He paid it in February 2020. \n(Answer at 16; AX D.) \nApplicant has enrolled in a financial management course through his church. (AX \nH.) He now has a budget, which reflects his net monthly income of $3,920, expenses of \n$3,275, projected student-loan payments of $200 per month, payments on a credit-union \nloan of $105 per month, and a net monthly remainder of $340. (AX G.) \n \nApplicant\u2019s branch chief for the past five years, a retired Army non-commissioned \nofficer, testified that he has watched Applicant mature over the years into a reliable, \ndependable, and trustworthy electronic technician. (Tr. 72-73.) One of Applicant\u2019s co-\nworkers for the past three years, a former Army Green Beret, submitted a statement \nattesting to Applicant\u2019s growth in his personal and professional life. He considers \nApplicant a loyal, reliable, talented employee, with a unique ability to solve problems with \nan \u201coutside-the-box\u201d approach. (AX F.) \nPolicies \n\u201c[N]o one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, \n484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to \n\u201ccontrol access to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The \nPresident has authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicants \neligibility for access to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 2. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, an administrative judge \napplies these guidelines in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense \ndecision. An administrative judge must consider all available and reliable information \nabout the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk that the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nClearance decisions must be made \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in \nno sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865 \n\u00a7 7. Thus, a decision to deny a security clearance is merely an indication the applicant \nhas not met the strict guidelines the President and the Secretary of Defense have \nestablished for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 15-01253 at 3 \n(App. Bd. Apr.20, 2016). \n \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005).  \nAn applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent \nwith the national interest to grant or continue his security clearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-\n20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See ISCR \nCase No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the evidence submitted at the hearing establish the \ntwo disqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d) \nand AG \u00b6 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe following mitigating conditions are potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \n6 \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a) is not established.

The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h-1.j, 1.l, and 1.m were \nincurred because of his lack of attention to his financial obligations. \nAG \u00b6 20(c) is established. Applicant has enrolled in a financial counseling program \nsponsored by his church, he has adopted a reasonable budget, and his financial problems \nare under control. \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is established. Applicant dropped out of college in September 2018, \nwhen he realized that he could not afford any more student loans. He brought one of his \nloans up to date in March 2019, consolidated some of his student loans, and was making \nmonthly $150 payments as of November 2019. In February 2020, he consolidated all his \nstudent loans, which are now in forbearance. He has settled the credit-card debt alleged \nin SOR \u00b6 1.h. He made monthly payments on the delinquent rent debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 \n1.i for about a year and has settled it. He negotiated a payment plan for the insurance \ndebt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.j and has resolved it. He tried to locate the creditor for the debt \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.k, but was hampered by inadequate specificity of the SOR. He has \nmade good-faith efforts to resolve the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f and 1.l. He has resolved \nthe insurance debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.m.  \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. In applying the whole-\nperson concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant \ncircumstances and applying the adjudicative factors in AG \u00b6 2(d): (1) the nature, extent, \nand seriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment. Applicant prudently dropped out of college in September 2018 when \nhe realized that he could not afford any more student loans. However, the debts alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.f, 1.h, 1.i, 1.j, 1.l, and 1.m were already delinquent because he had not paid \nattention to his financial obligations. He has since matured and has taken significant steps \nto right his financial ship. His supervisor, an experienced military retiree, has watched him \nmature and is now confident that he has the reliability, trustworthiness, and good \njudgment expected of those who are entrusted with classified information. After weighing \nthe disqualifying and mitigating conditions under Guideline F, and evaluating all the \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nevidence in the context of the whole person, I conclude Applicant has mitigated the \nsecurity concerns raised by his delinquent debts. \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F (Financial Considerations): FOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.o: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is clearly consistent with the national security interests of the \nUnited States to continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nClearance is granted. \nLeRoy F.

It also alleged that Applicant falsified his July \n2018 SCA when he answered \u201cno\u201d to the financial questions in Section 26 (Financial \nRecord) and failed to disclose the delinquent accounts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d \nthrough 1.l. \nIn his answers to the SOR, Applicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. All of \nthe SOR financial allegations are also established by the four credit reports in evidence \n(GE 2\u20134, and 6). He also admitted to falsifying his 2018 SCA. His admissions are \nincorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I \nmake the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant is a 33-year-old employee of a federal contractor. He graduated from \nhigh school in 2008, and attended a technology institute where he was certified as an \nautomotive mechanic. He married in February 2012 and divorced in January 2015. He \nis currently engaged to be married. He has four children from different relationships, \nages 2, 6, 8, and 10. (Tr. 28-30) \nApplicant testified that he raised himself because his parents were never around \nto mentor, educate, or to teach him how to be financially responsible. (Tr. 22) He \nenlisted in the Navy trying to get away from the bad influences in the streets of his \nneighborhood and to become a productive member of society \nApplicant enlisted in the Navy in 2008, and served on active duty until 2013, \nwhen he was honorably discharged as an E-3. He believes he held a secret-clearance \nwhile in the service that was continued after his discharge.

Other than those two periods of \nunemployment, he has been fully employed since his discharge from the service. (Tr. \n26-27) He has worked for his current employer and clearance sponsor at least twice, \nstarting his most recent employment period as a shipyard painter in July 2021. (Tr. 26) \nSection 26 (Financial Record) of Applicant\u2019s 2018 SCA asked whether in the past \nseven years he had: (1) bills or debts turned over to a collection agency; (2) any \naccount or credit card suspended, charged off, or cancelled for failing to pay as agreed; \n(3) defaulted on any type of loan; and (4) been over 120 days\u2019 delinquent on any debt; \nor was currently over 120 days\u2019 delinquent on any debt. Applicant disclosed that he was \n$2,200 delinquent in his child support obligation to his daughter. He also disclosed that \nhe cosigned a car loan that was then charged off for lack of payments (SOR \u00b6 1.c). \nAside from the two exceptions noted above, Applicant answered \u201cNo\u201d to all the 2018 \nSCA financial questions and failed to disclose the delinquent financial accounts alleged \nin SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, and 1.d through 1.l. \nApplicant initially stated that he did not remember all of his delinquent accounts \nwhen he completed the 2018 SCA. Later, he testified that he was aware that he was \ndelinquent on most of the alleged SOR accounts. (Tr. 59-60) He stated that he \ndisclosed some of the accounts he omitted to an OPM investigator during his December \n2018 interview. (Tr. 59) Because he objected to the admissibility of his PSI, I did not \nconsider his PSI and his hearing statement is uncorroborated. At hearing, Applicant \ntestified that when he completed the 2018 SCA, he was paying child support for his \noldest daughter, but later on her mother released him of the child support obligation. (Tr. \n30) \nApplicant\u2019s state is currently garnishing his wages to pay for his $2,600 child \nsupport obligation in arrears. Applicant explained that the court made his child support \npayments retroactive. Thus, when the obligation started, he was already in arrears and \nhas not been able to catch up. He also claimed his $800 a month child support \npayments are too high. He explained that when his ex-wife filed for child support, she \ntold the court he was making $80,000 a year. Applicant has not been making that much \nmoney for some time. Currently, he is making about $26 an hour. He testified that he \ncould not afford to pay his child support obligation and his family\u2019s living expenses. He \nplans to request the court to lower his child support obligation. (Tr. 49-53) \nConcerning SOR \u00b6 1.a, Applicant testified that he took a car loan in 2010, to \npurchase a 2009 Charger. The account became delinquent in 2013. Applicant claimed \nthat on an unknown date, he called the lender to explain he could not afford the car \nbecause his son was about to be born. He also stated he called the lender seeking a \nsettlement for less than what he owed, and that more recently, he called the lender to \nask how he could have the delinquent account removed from his credit report. He \naverred that his ex-wife took the car to have it repaired, but the repairs were so high that \nthey could not afford to pay them and the car was repossessed.

The loan \nbecame delinquent in June of 2016, and the car was repossessed. He was fully \nemployed at the time that he made the car loan. Applicant claimed he told the lender of \nhis agreement with his wife when the car note became delinquent, but the lender \nrefused to take him off the note. When asked about his intentions with respect to the \nloan, Applicant stated that he was looking for ways to have it removed from his credit \nreport. (Tr. 37-40) \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges another delinquent car loan. Applicant purchased the car in \nJanuary 2013 and the account became delinquent five months later in June 2013. \nApplicant testified that he called the lender in 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2018 seeking a \nsettlement for less than what he owed without success. He averred the lender refused \nthe settlement offers. He never made any payments on this car note. (Tr. 42-43) \nSOR \u00b6 1.d alleges a delinquent personal loan Applicant took in 2011 while he \nwas still in the service. The loan became delinquent in 2013. He claimed that the loan \nwas paid by direct deposit from his bank account. He was given the opportunity to \nsubmit documentary evidence to corroborate his claims, but he failed to do so. (Tr. 43\u00ad\n45) \nConcerning the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.e through 1.l, Applicant testified that \nthese were his delinquent accounts. He claimed he tried to dispute some of them in \n2019, but was unsuccessful. He presented no documentary evidence of: any disputes \nfiled, valid legal issues to justify the disputes, any contacts with the creditors, any \npayments made, or of any payment arrangements established with any of the creditors. \n(Tr. 47-49) \nApplicant owes the IRS about $1,200 for tax year 2020. He claimed he contacted \nthe IRS about two weeks before his hearing to establish a payment plan. As of his \nhearing date, he did not have a payment plan in place. (Tr. 52-53) \nApplicant\u2019s current monthly net income is about $4,400 a month. He believes he \nhas about $600 in a savings account and $300 in a checking account after paying his \nliving expenses. His rent is $900. His monthly groceries expense is over $1,200 \nbecause he has three children living with him. To keep his children active in sports he \npays $75 a month for the three children. He pays $800 monthly in child support. He \nopened a credit card in January 2021. He called it his \u201cself-card\u201d because it is supposed \nto help him build his credit back. (Tr. 55-58) \nApplicant understood that his finances would be of concern to the Government \nwhen he submitted his 2018 SCA. He did not present evidence to show that he has a \nworking budget or that he has received any financial counseling.

He failed to submit any documentary evidence of any contact with creditors, of \nany payment plans established, or of any payments made on any of the debts alleged in \nthe SOR. \nApplicant believes that he is more mature regarding his finances now, and that \nhe has learned from the clearance process. He intends to establish payment plans to \npay off his debts sometime in the future - when he has funds available to do so. He \nbelieves that with his current job he will have the financial means to pay his debts \nthrough payment plans, and that his financial situation would be stable. \nPolicies \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information Within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense (DOD) Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance \nReview Program (Directive) (January 2, 1992), as amended; and Security Executive \nAgent Directive (SEAD) 4, National Security Adjudicative Guidelines for Determining \nEligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position \n(AGs), applicable to all adjudicative decisions issued on or after June 8, 2017. \nEligibility for access to classified information may be granted \u201conly upon a finding \nthat it is clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \nThe AGs list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered. \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts.

Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . ..  \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are documented in the record. The delinquent \ndebts alleged in the SOR are established by his admissions and the record evidence. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d The record established these disqualifying conditions, \nrequiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \nI considered the seven financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n20; however, only two are potentially applicable: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and, \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a god-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditor or otherwise resolve debts. \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained an applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 2(b). ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2013).  \nThe AG \u00b6 20(b) financial considerations mitigating condition is not fully \nestablished by the facts in this case and does not mitigate the security concerns. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems started in about 2011. All of the delinquent accounts \nalleged in the SOR are still ongoing and unresolved. Applicant\u2019s evidence is somewhat \nsufficient to establish that circumstances beyond his control contributed to his financial \nproblems, i.e., his periods of unemployment, his divorce, and him having custody of \nthree children and being the sole provider. \nNotwithstanding, Applicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to establish that he has been \nfinancially responsible under the circumstances. There is no evidence to show that he is \nfollowing a budget or recently participated in financial counseling. Applicant submitted \nno documented evidence of good-faith efforts to resolve his debts before he submitted \nhis 2018 SCA; after he was interviewed by a Government investigator in 2018; after he \nreceived the 2020 SOR; or before his September 2021 hearing. AG \u00b6 20(d) is not \napplicable. \nConsidering the evidence as a whole, Applicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to \ndemonstrate his financial responsibility, that his financial problems are being resolved, \nor that he has the financial ability to pay his debts. The financial considerations security \nconcerns are not mitigated. \nGuideline E - Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the security concern pertaining to personal conduct: \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. The following will normally result \nin an unfavorable national security eligibility determination, security \nclearance action, or cancellation of further processing for national security \neligibility: \n(a) refusal, or failure without reasonable cause, to undergo or cooperate \nwith security processing, including but not limited to meeting with a \nsecurity investigator for subject interview, completing security forms or \nreleases, cooperation with medical or psychological evaluation, or \npolygraph examination, if authorized and required; and \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes a condition that could raise a security concern and be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant from any \npersonal security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities.  \nWhen Applicant submitted his 2018 SCA, he knew he had accounts that were \ndelinquent, in collection, charged off, or had a car repossessed. He failed to disclose \nthose delinquent accounts in his 2018 SCA. He deliberately falsified his 2018 SCA to \ncover his financial problems. His lack of candor and dishonesty demonstrate \nquestionable judgment, unreliability, and an unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, establishing the above disqualifying condition. \nAG \u00b6 17 provides seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised \nunder this guideline. Only two of those mitigating conditions are potentially applicable to \nthe facts in this case: \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; and \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress. \nAfter thorough consideration of the facts, the above mitigating conditions are not \nsupported by the facts in this case and they are not applicable. Applicant\u2019s evidence is \ninsufficient to fully establish any mitigating factors under AG \u00b6 17. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have \nincorporated my comments under Guidelines F and E in my whole-person analysis. \nSome of these factors were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant \nadditional comment: \nApplicant, 33, was unemployed between August 2013 and January 2014, and \nbetween January 2015 and May 2015. Except for these two periods of unemployment, \nhe has been fully employed with different federal contractor since January 2014. His \nevidence is insufficient to establish a track record of financial responsibility. Moreover, \nhe falsified his 2018 SCA in failing to disclose his financial problems, as required. It is \nwell settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nUnmitigated personal conduct and financial considerations security concerns lead me to \nconclude that granting a security clearance to Applicant is not warranted. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nAgainst Applicant \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for a security clearance.

(Ans., GE 3) \nApplicant and a partner operated a finance company that provided business loans. \nApplicant claimed in his SF 86 that his business partner committed fraudulent activities, \nand that Applicant was \u201ccoerced and ended up being responsible for his [partner\u2019s] \nactions, as a partner of the business.\u201d (GE 4) In 2001, Applicant and his partner were \ncharged in a felony complaint with five counts of grand theft, and two special charges \nalleging Applicant and his partner intended to take over $250,000 in property. Applicant \nwas convicted of two counts of felony grand theft and, inter alia, confinement, probation, \nand fined $142,868 to be paid to the court as restitution. He completed probation and the \nsentence to confinement. As of January 2020, Applicant paid only $24,029 toward this \ndebt with a balance due of $91,155. He failed to make any voluntary payments between \n2007 and January 2020. As of January 2020, the court forwarded the balance due to an \nexternal collection agency. (GE 7) \nIn response to an interview by a government investigator in April 2019, Applicant \nclaimed that his business partner asked him to write a check for $100,000. The check \nwas not backed with sufficient funds. Applicant could not recall to whom the check was \nwritten or for what purpose, and why he was asked to write it. He was unable to explain \nhis business and the circumstances that led to him writing the bad check.

This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, \nby necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard sensitive information. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a public trust position, the \nadministrative judge must consider the disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the AG. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with an evaluation of the \nwhole person. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial \nand commonsense decision. An administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under AG \n\u00b6 2(b), \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to [sensitive] \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d The Government must present \nsubstantial evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.14. Once the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, \nand the burden of disproving it never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). An applicant has the ultimate burden of \ndemonstrating that it is clearly consistent with national security to grant or continue \neligibility for access to sensitive information.  \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe Security concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness. By its very nature, it calls into question a person\u2019s ability or \nwillingness to comply with laws, rules and regulations. \n \nAG \u00b6 31 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following are potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the individual was formally charged, prosecuted, or convicted. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, testimony, and the documentary evidence in the record \nconcerning his criminal conduct and failure to pay restitution as required by the court are \nsufficient to establish the disqualifying conditions above. \nConditions that could mitigate criminal conduct security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 32. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it \nhappened under such unusual circumstances, that it is unlikely to recur and \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \n(b) the individual was pressured or coerced into committing the act and \nthose pressures are no longer present in the person\u2019s life; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including, but not limited \nto, the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nApplicant\u2019s criminal conviction occurred in 2002, he successfully completed \nprobation, and the fraudulent conduct has not been repeated. However, Applicant has not \nclearly acknowledged the wrongfulness of his conduct, and was vague and less than \nforthcoming in providing full and complete information regarding his offenses in his SF 86 \nand to a Government investigator. Applicant also failed to complete his restitution \npayments when required, and was unaware of specific information as to those payments \nwhen questioned by the investigator. Although he resumed restitution payments in \nJanuary 2020, it is too little, too late. Applicant claimed that his spotty employment from \nDecember 2017 to January 2019 inhibited him from paying restitution on time, but the \nrecord shows Applicant was able to travel extensively overseas on vacations from 2012 \nto 2019. His explanations are unsubstantiated and carry little weight. Although the \nbusiness which led to his criminal conduct has apparently subsided, Applicant has not \ncompleted court-ordered restitution and intentionally failed to pay restitution when \nrequired. There is no convincing evidence that Applicant was pressured or coerced, and \nhis explanation of coercion raises questions as to his willingness to admit culpability for \nhis crimes. Likewise, little evidence was submitted showing a good employment record \nor constructive community involvement. \nI find that no mitigating condition fully applies. His criminal conduct continues to \nimpugn his status in the community, and shows a serious lapse in judgment and trust that \nhas not yet been mitigated with time or treatment. \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe trustworthiness concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThe relevant disqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 19 include: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the documentary evidence in the record are sufficient \nto establish the disqualifying conditions above. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nThe DOHA Appeal Board has long held that trustworthiness requirements \ngenerally include consideration of a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and a sense of his or \nher legal obligations. Failure to comply with Federal tax laws suggests that an applicant \nhas a problem with abiding by well-established government rules and regulations. \nVoluntary compliance with rules and regulations is essential for protecting sensitive \ninformation. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to file his tax returns when required raises questions about his \njudgment and willingness to abide by rules and regulations. Although Applicant has filed \nhis Federal tax returns late, and is in an IRS tax repayment installment plan. AG \u00b6 20 (g) \napplies. Nonetheless, Applicant showed a serious lapse in judgment and an unwillingness \nto comply with laws, rules and regulations leading up to his recent repayment \narrangements. Applicant\u2019s explanations for failing to file tax returns or pay taxes when \nowed are insufficient to award mitigation credit. His newfound intentions to enter into a \npayment plan, and to file past-due returns appears motivated by his desire to obtain \ntrustworthiness determination from the Government. Also, there is no evidence that his \nstate income tax obligations have been resolved. Like his restitution payments as noted \nabove, his efforts to resolve his tax delinquencies amounts to too little, too late. \nOverall, Applicant has shown insufficient efforts to resolve debts, despite \nemployment since April 2019. No other mitigating condition fully applies. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6\u00b6 2(a), 2(c), and 2(d), the ultimate determination of whether to grant \nnational security eligibility must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. Under the whole-person \nconcept, the administrative judge must evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a position of \ntrust by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. \nThe administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at \nAG \u00b6 2(d). \nI considered all of the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my findings of fact \nand comments under Guidelines J and F, in my whole-person analysis. I considered \nApplicant\u2019s current employment status, and past periods of unemployment. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a public trust position. For these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the criminal conduct and financial considerations \ntrustworthiness concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline F: \nAGAINST A\n PPLICANT \nSubparagraph 2.a and 2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security to \ngrant Applicant eligibility for a public trust position.

He has earned a bachelor\u2019s degree. For at least the past 20 \nyears, he has worked steadily without interruption. Divorced, he was married from 2003 \nthrough 2018. He is the father of two minor children. This case involves an account \ncharged-off for almost $70,000 related to a second mortgage. \nIn 2005, Applicant and his former wife bought a home funded with two loans, one \nfor $244,000 and another for $61,000. In April 2006, Applicant accepted a revolving line \nof credit with a maximum limit of $81,800, and paid off the $61,000 second mortgage the \nfollowing month. The balance owed on this line of credit was never repaid. \nIn 2008, an economic downturn occurred and caused Applicant\u2019s home to become \n\u201csignificantly under water.\u201d (FORM at 3 of 8) Applicant writes that he unsuccessfully tried \nto contact the loan servicer, but he provided no documentation reflecting such efforts. He \ndevised a strategy that involved his letting the property go into foreclosure, then \npurchased a second home in the same town with a $416,990 loan. This raised his monthly \nmortgage obligations from about $2,030 to $2,620.

Applicant gives no reason for \nacquiring this second home other than noting he intended to have his first home go into \nforeclosure. \nApplicant admits that the second mortgage account on the first property originally \nobtained was charged-off. He cites to a state law that applies to mortgages given to \nsecure the payment of the balance of the purchase price, or to secure a loan to pay all or \npart of the purchase price. While he argues that the charged-off account at issue was \nactually obtained to pay for the down payment on the house, the available credit reports \nand recorded property documents in the FORM indicate that the charged off account was \nactually a revolving line of credit that he opened after the initial home purchase and in \naddition to the primary and secondary mortgages note above. (see FORM at 3 of 8; \nFORM Exs. 3, 5-7, 9-11) \nIn his materials, Applicant describes his foreclosure strategy as his family\u2019s best \noption for dealing with their financial situation. He writes that it was \u201ca deliberate action \nbased on sound judgment regarding the situation and economic guidance.\u201d (FORM Exs. \n3, 5) He stresses that he made his decision based on professional and legal advice. \n(FORM Exs.3, 5) Applicant conveys that his credit and financial situation is in good \nstanding, although he did not provide a current financial statement.

(FORM Ex. 3) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an applicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence, and transcends \nduty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in those \ngranted such access. Decisions necessarily include consideration of the possible risk an \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions \nshall be in terms of the national interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant. \nAnalysis \nUnder Guideline F, AG \u00b6 18 sets forth that the security concern under this guideline \nis that failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by \nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHere, the Government offered documentary evidence reflecting that Applicant \nceased making payments on a line of credit in 2014. That account became, and remains, \ndelinquent. This is sufficient to invoke financial considerations disqualifying conditions: \nAG \u00b6 19(a): inability to satisfy debts; \nAG \u00b6 19(b): unwillingness to satisfy debts regardless of the ability to do so; \nand \nAG \u00b6 19(c): a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nUnder these facts, three conditions could mitigate related security concerns: \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problems from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nIn 2004, Applicant acquired a home funded through a first and second mortgage. \nA year later, in 2005, he received a line of credit. He used this line of credit to pay off his \nsecond mortgage. A 2008 economic downturn led to Applicant\u2019s home value becoming \n\u201cunder water.\u201d After securing a new home in which to live, he volitionally chose to cease \nmaking payments on the line of credit previously acquired. He had a choice to honor his \ndebt or walk away from it; he chose the latter. He provided no documentation reflecting \nefforts to address this debt in a different manner or to work with his lender toward an \nalternative resolution. \nMoreover, there is no documentation showing Applicant has received or is \nreceiving financial counseling from a legitimate and credible source. There are no \nindications that the problem was resolved or is under control. Indeed, while Applicant \nargues that his strategy is supported under state law because the account at issue was \na mortgage, he provided insufficient documentation to challenge its description elsewhere \nas a line of credit. Because there is insufficient documentation to refute this description, \nand given the timing of his acquisition of this account long after the home was funded by \na first and second mortgage, Applicant\u2019s strategy does not release him from responsibility \nfor the delinquent debt at issue. Consequently, none of the available mitigating conditions \napply.  \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                       \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Here, I have considered those factors. I am also \nmindful that, under AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \na security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based on careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant is a 44-year-old college graduate who has worked as a senior solutions \nmanager for the same employer since October 2018. He has been steadily employed for \nthe past two decades. He has two minor children. Applicant was divorced in 2018. This \ncase involves an account charged-off for almost $70,000. \nIn 2005, Applicant and his former wife bought a home funded by a first mortgage \nfor $244,000 and a second mortgage for $61,000. A year later, in 2006, he used a newly \nacquired revolving line of credit to pay off the second mortgage. He ultimately chose to \nstop making payments on this account under the theory that this account was actually a \nmortgage, a theory which, under state law, could absolve him of responsibility for this \ndebt. \nHowever, Applicant concedes the line of credit was used to satisfy the second \nmortgage secured a year earlier to acquire his home. If it was something other than a \nmortgage, Applicant cannot simply declare it to have been one in order to avail himself of \na protection offered in his state. Here, Applicant\u2019s documentation fails to refute the \nevidence suggesting that this line of credit was, in fact, a line of credit used to satisfy a \nsecond mortgage \u2013 and not a second mortgage. With this debt thus acquired and ignored, \nfinancial considerations security concerns remain. This is true regardless of whether he \nis currently in a solid and secure financial situation. Consequently, I find Applicant has \nmitigated financial considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nArthur E.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec. Or. 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms \nof the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also Exec. Or. 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline F (Financial Considerations) \nThe concern under this guideline is set out in AG \u00b6 18: \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d); \nand 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant admitted, and his credit reports confirm, that he is responsible for the \ndelinquent debts. He blames the debts on his divorce in 2016, but provided no \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ninformation to support a nexus between the 2016 divorce and the delinquent debts.

The Government has cause to question whether Applicant has his \nfinances under control. Despite gainful employment, there is no evidence that Applicant \nhas made any payments on any of the delinquent debts. Any doubts must be resolved \nin favor of the Government. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Because protection of the interests of \nnational security is the principal focus of these adjudications, any remaining doubts \nmust be resolved by denying eligibility for access to sensitive information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u20131.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.h: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Administrative Judge \nBased upon a review of the case file, pleadings, exhibits, and testimony, \nApplicant did not mitigate financial consideration and personal conduct concerns. \nEligibility for access to classified information or to hold a sensitive position is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn March 17, 2020, the Department of Defense (DoD) Consolidated Central \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant detailing \nreasons why under the financial considerations and personal conduct guidelines it could \nnot make the preliminary affirmative determination of eligibility for granting a security \nclearance, and recommended referral to an administrative judge to determine whether a \nsecurity clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. The action was \ntaken under Executive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information \nwithin Industry (February 20, 1960); DoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial \nPersonnel Security Clearance Review Program (Directive), January 2, 1992; and \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on April 20, 2020, and requested a hearing. A \nhearing was scheduled for October 15, 2020. The case was heard on the scheduled \ndate. At the hearing, the Government\u2019s case consisted of four exhibits (GE): one \nthrough four. Applicant relied on no exhibits and one witness (himself). The transcript \n(Tr.) was received on October 30, 2020. \nProcedural Issues \nBefore the close of the hearing, Applicant requested the proceedings be kept \nopen to permit him the opportunity to supplement the record with post-hearing \ndocumentation of his resolving his debts: either by payments or having them removed \nfrom his credit report. (Tr. 16-18) For good cause shown, applicant was granted 30 days \nto supplement the record. Department Counsel was afforded five days to respond. \nApplicant did not supplement the record. \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly accumulated four delinquent debts that ex- \nceed $22,000. Allegedly, these debts remain unresolved and outstanding.  \n   \nUnder Guideline E, Applicant allegedly falsified his July 2018 electronic \nquestionnaires for electronic processing (e-QIP) by omitting his delinquent accounts \ndetailed in sub-paragraphs 1.a-1.d of the SOR. \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant denied the alleged debts covered by SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c, claiming that each of the allegations have either been paid or should be \nsettled and removed from his credit report. He admitted the allegations covered by SOR \n\u00b6 1.d, with explanations. Addressing the allegations covered in SOR \u00b6 2.a, Applicant \ndenied the allegations pertaining to falsification, claiming he could not recall what was \non his credit report and did not deliberately falsify material facts. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 47-year-old network engineer for a defense contractor who seeks a \nsecurity clearance. The allegations covered in SOR \u00b6 1.d and admitted by Applicant are \nincorporated and adopted as relevant and material findings. Additional findings follow. \nBackground \nApplicant married in October 2020 and has two children predating his marriage. \n(GE 1; Tr. 24-25) Applicant earned a general educational development (GED) diploma \nin 1992 and has not earned any college credits. (GE 1; Tr. 25-26) He reported no \nmilitary service. \nSince December 2016, Applicant has been employed by his current employer. \nBetween March 2009 and December 2016, he worked for a non-defense contractor as a \nmotor coach operator.

(Tr. 23-24) \nApplicant\u2019s finances \nBetween July 2018 and November 2019, Applicant accumulated four delinquent \ndebts exceeding $22,000, according to his recent credit reports. (GEs 2-5; Tr. 15-16) He \ndisputed three of the debts (SOR debts \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.c) at hearing, claiming they either were \npaid or should be removed from his credit report. (Tr. 25-26) Applicant attributed his \ndelinquent debts to a lack of money. Further, he disputed the debts allegedly owed to \nSOR creditors 1.a-1.c. (GEs 2-5; Tr. 27, 30) He pledged to look into these debts \ncovered by the SOR and either take care of them or have them removed from his credit \nreport. (GE 2; Tr. 16-17, 32-34) Afforded an opportunity to supplement the record with \npost-hearing documentation of steps he has taken to address his debts and resolve \nthem by payment or removal from his credit report, Applicant did not provide any \nadditional information. \nBased on the credible information developed in Applicant\u2019s credit reports, each of \nthe debts listed in the SOR belong to Applicant and remain delinquent and unresolved. \nApplicant provided neither evidence of payment nor a good-faith dispute of any of the \nlisted SOR debts. His claims of having no financial obligations to the SOR 1.a creditor \nby virtue of his suffering a total loss of the vehicle covered by the SOR 1.a loan in \ndefault are not corroborated and cannot be accepted without supporting documentation. \nSimilarly, his claims that the medical debt covered by SOR \u00b6 1.b was never a billable \ndebt to him due to his lack of medical procedure authorization is not documented by any \ncorrespondence or other evidence validating his contemporaneous claims. Applicant\u2019s \nlack of recall of the debts covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c-1.d are not documented with any \ninformation that might shed light on his claims. With current annual income of $45,000 \nfrom his current employer, he would appear to have sufficient monetary resources to \naddress some or all of the debts listed in the SOR. (Tr. 26) \nE-QIP omissions \nAsked to complete an e-QIP in July 2018, Applicant omitted any delinquent debts \nwhen responding to questions about his finances covered by Section 26 of the e-QIP. \nApplicant denied any intent to falsify his e-QIP with omissions of the debts covered by \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a-1.d. He attributed his negative answers to the questions posed in section \n26 of his e-QIP to a lack of recollection \u201cat the time what was in his credit report\u201d \n(Applicant\u2019s response and GEs 1-2) In two follow-up interviews with an agent of the \nOffice of Personnel Management (OPM) in July 2018 and January 2019, respectively, \nApplicant was asked by the interviewing agent if he had any financial issues, to which \nhe replied in the negative. (GE 2) \nAfter confirming to the investigating OPM agent in his July 2018 personal subject \ninterview that he had no financial issues, the Agent confronted Applicant with three of \nthe debts listed in the SOR (SOR debts 1.a and 1.c-1.d). (GE 2; Tr. 42-43) Once asked \nabout the SOR 1.a car loan, he provided fresh details of the circumstances which he \n3 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nbelieved warranted his being excused from payment responsibility. He assured that he \nhad evidence of his dispute with the car lender over his owing any more loan payments \non the vehicle that he could provide in post-hearing documentation. Without any \nadditional information to clarify and substantiate his dispute with SOR 1.a creditor, his e-\nQIP omissions cannot be reconciled as a good-faith misunderstanding about the status \nof the listed SOR 1.a debt attributed to Applicant. Nor can his explanations about the \norigins and status of the other three omitted debts listed in the SOR (SOR debts 1.b-\n1.d) be credited to him as acts of forgetfulness without provided corroborating \ninformation (either during or after the completion of the hearing). Based on a thorough \nconsideration of all of the compiled evidence in the record, inferences of candor lapses \non the part of Applicant in his omission of the four debts listed in the SOR are \nwarranted. \nPolicies \nBy virtue of the jurisprudential principles recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court \nin Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an \nindividual is sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. \nEligibility for access to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. \nThe AGs must be considered before deciding whether or not a security clearance \nshould be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not require judges \nto place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in \nthe guidelines in arriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(a) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern: Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy \ndebts and meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which \ncan raise questions about an applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can \nalso be caused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, \nother issues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, \nmental health conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or \ndependence. An individual who is financially overextended is at greater \nrisk of having to engage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to \ngenerate funds.  .  .  . AG \u00b6 18. \nPersonal Conduct \nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Of special interest is \nany failure to cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during \nnational security investigative or adjudicative processes.  .  .  . AG \u00b6 15. \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \n5 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). \nThe burden of disproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. \nSee ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; \nsee AG \u00b6 2(b).  \nAnalysis \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent debts \nbetween 2018 and 2019. Additional security concerns are raised over his omission of \nhis delinquent debts in the e-QIP he completed in July 2018. \nFinancial concerns \nApplicant\u2019s accumulation of four delinquent debts between 2018 and 2019 \nwarrants the application of two disqualifying conditions (DCs) of the financial \nconsiderations guideline. DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of \nnot meeting financial obligations,\u201d apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. \n6 \n \nApplicant\u2019s admitted debt covered by SOR \u00b6 1.d negates the need for any \nindependent proof. See Directive 5220-6 at E3. 1.1.14; McCormick on Evidence, \u00a7 262 \n(6th  ed. 2006). His admitted SOR \u00b6 1.d debt delinquency is fully documented and \ncreates some initial judgment issues.

While the \nprincipal concern of a clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties is \nvulnerability to coercion and influence, judgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases \ninvolving debt delinquencies. \nWithout more clarifying information about the four delinquent debts listed in his \ncredit reports and covered in the SOR, Applicant is not eligible for mitigation credit. His \nreported debt delinquencies are both recent and material to a trust assessment of \nwhether Applicant\u2019s finances are sufficiently stabilized at this time to meet the eligibility \nrequirements for access to classified or sensitive information. \nConsidering all of the facts and circumstances in the record, Applicant\u2019s \naccumulation of delinquent debts that have not been since paid, resolved, or \nsuccessfully disputed are not mitigated. Mitigation preclusion is based on the absence \nof any furnished information by Applicant documenting his payment, resolution, or \nreasonable dispute of the debts covered by SOR. \nPersonal conduct concerns \nPotentially serious and difficult to reconcile with the trust and reliability \nrequirements for holding a security clearance are the security concerns raised by \nApplicant\u2019s omissions of the debts listed in the SOR in the e-QIP he completed in July \n2018. So much trust is imposed on those cleared to access classified and sensitive \ninformation that accommodations for breaches are necessarily narrowly calibrated. See \nSnepp v. United States, 444 U.S. 506, 511 n.6 (1980). \nMaterial breaches of an applicant\u2019s disclosure responsibilities in a security \nclearance application are, in turn, incompatible with the high trust principles affirmed in \nSnepp. Applicant\u2019s failure to provide any documented explanations of the debts he \nclaims are disputed when afforded a post-hearing opportunity to do so only serves to \nreinforce the Government\u2019s claims that he omitted his debts in the e-QIP he completed \nout of concern that disclosure could impact assessments of his security clearance \neligibility. \nApplicant\u2019s 2018 e-QIP omissions invite application of one of the disqualifying \nconditions (DCs) of the personal conduct guidelines (DCs) DC \u00b6\u00b6 (16(a), \u201cdeliberate \nomission, concealment, or falsification or relevant facts from any personnel security \nquestionnaire, personal history statement, or similar form used to conduct \ninvestigations, determine employment qualifications, award benefits or status, \n7 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndetermine national security eligibility \nor trustworthiness, or award fiduciary \nresponsibilities,\u201d applies to Applicant\u2019s situation. Based on all of the information \nconsidered in connection with his omitted debt delinquencies in the space provided in \nsection 26 of the e-QIP he completed in 2018, candor lapses are reflected in Applicant\u2019s \ndelinquent debt omissions. \nAfforded an opportunity to provide explanatory documentation in his scheduled \n2018 and 2019 OPM interview, Applicant told the OPM investigator that he had no \nadditional financial issues to discuss. At this point, he was confronted with three of the \nfour debts covered in the SOR. His answers reflected a general recollection of the \ncircumstances surrounding his car loss and amounts owing to his SOR 1.a creditor. His \nanswers to questions asked by the investigator about his SOR 1.c and 1.d debts were \nupdated only after confrontation, and do not reflect any attempt to voluntarily correct his \nomissions. \nApplicant\u2019s failure to provide any supplemental information, when under an \nimputed duty do so, reflects a continued effort to conceal material information about the \nstate of his finances which he failed to voluntarily correct in his follow-up OPM interview \nbefore he was confronted by the interviewing agent with the delinquent covered in the \nSOR. Applicant\u2019s ensuing failure to provide prompt, good-faith corrections when \nquestioned by the interviewing OPM agent warrants the application of DC \u00b6 16(b), \n\u201cdeliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or omitting \ninformation, concerning relevant facts to an employee, investigator, security official, \ncompetent medical or mental health professional involved in making a recommendation \nrelevant to a national security eligibility determination, or other government \nrepresentative, \u201d to the facts of Applicant\u2019s case. Without documentation of his disputes \nof the SOR debts in issue, inferences and conclusions of candor lapses cannot be \naverted. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his accumulated delinquent debts between 2018 and 2019 and \ne-QIP omissions reflect material breaches of the clearance eligibility requires of good \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness that are sufficient to preclude an overall \nassessment of clearance eligibility. \nAt this time, it is simply too soon to make safe predictive judgments about \nApplicant\u2019s ability to safeguard classified and sensitive information. Potentially \napplicable mitigating conditions are not available to Applicant. While Applicant is entitled \nto credit for his contributions to his employer and the U.S. defense effort generally, his \nefforts are not enough at this time to overcome the raised security concerns over the \nstate of his finances and overall honesty and trustworthiness questions associated with \nhis e-QIP omissions.  \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \n8 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n                           \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact In his SOR Answer, Applicant admitted SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a through 1.e, and denied SOR \u00b6 1.f, all with explanations. After a thorough and careful review of the pleadings and exhibits submitted, I make the following additional findings of fact. Applicant is 40 years old. His 2019 SCA reflects that he has never married and has no children. (Item 3) He graduated from high school in May 2004 and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in May 2009. (Item 4 at 2) Applicant worked at a campus bookstore from August 2006 to January 2017, when the store went out of business. (Item 3 at 12). While at the bookstore full time, he also worked nights at a retail department store from November 2012 to February 2015, when he was terminated due to an attendance issue. (Item 3 at 13-14; Item 4 at 2-3) After a brief period of unemployment in early 2017, he worked as an assistant store manager at a food store starting in March 2017. (Item 3 at 11) Applicant\u2019s more recent employment history is unclear. His SCA does not reflect his current employer, though his file reflects that the SOR was sent to him through the facility security office of a defense contractor, presumably his sponsor for a clearance. His April 2019 interview summary contains no information about his then-current employment. (Item 4) Applicant provided no information in his SOR Answer, or since then, about his recent or current employment or sources of income. (Item 2; AE 1) He has not previously held a security clearance. (Item 3 at 27",

(Applicant\u2019s Answer \ncontains two pages concerning \u201cchoice of forum.\u201d On one of them, he elected a decision \nbased on the administrative record, and signed his name, though there is no date. The \nother \u201cchoice of forum\u201d page is signed and dated March 6, 2020 but neither forum is \nselected). Applicant\u2019s SOR Answer also contains documents relating to his student loans. \nOn June 30, 2020, the Government submitted a File of Relevant Material (FORM), \nconsisting of six exhibits (Items 1 - 6). On July 9, 2020, Applicant received a copy of the \nFORM, which instructed him to respond within 30 days of receipt. \nThe case was forwarded to the DOHA Hearing Office when no timely response \nfrom Applicant was received. On September 15, 2020, the case was assigned to a DOHA \nadministrative judge for a decision. On February 4, 2021, after considering the record, the \ninitial administrative judge issued a decision in which he denied Applicant\u2019s request for a \nclearance. Applicant appealed. Language in the Appeal Board\u2019s decision indicates that \none of the matters at issue was whether Applicant had been informed of his right to \nrespond to the FORM. (Appeal Board (AB) Decision at 1-2) \nOn May 10, 2021, the DOHA Appeal Board remanded the case \u201cto reopen the \nrecord and permit Applicant to have a new timeframe in which to submit [a] response to \nthe FORM.\u201d (AB Decision at 2) The Appeal Board also directed that the case be remanded \nto a different judge \u201cwho shall administer the proceedings in accordance with the Directive \nand issue a new decision in accordance with Directive \u00b6 E3.1.35.\u201d (AB Decision at 2) \nRe-Opening of the Record \nOn May 11, 2021, the case was assigned to me. A May 19, 2021 conference call \nwas held among the parties, and memorialized in an e-mail. (Hearing Exhibit (HE I) As \ndetailed in HE I, during the conference call Applicant confirmed several things about the \nstate of the record at that point. He confirmed: \n- \nReceiving the Statement of Reasons, answering it, and waiving his right to a \nhearing; \n- \nReceiving the Government\u2019s File of Relevant Material (FORM) and the \npackage of materials and confirmed that he still had it;  \n \n \n \n \n \n- \nThat he did not submit a response to the FORM, either before or after \nSeptember 24, 2020 (a date addressed in the Appeal Board Decision), nor had \nhe been contacted by anyone at DOHA about whether he wished to do so; and \n- \nThat he wished to submit documents in response to the FORM. \nI therefore reopened the record until June 18, 2021, for Applicant \u201cto have the \nopportunity to submit documents in response to the Government\u2019s FORM (such as \ndocuments relating to specific SOR debts, relating to his finances generally, or any other \nmatters [sic] he wishes to provide,\u201d as well as a narrative response in writing. . . .\u201d (HE I) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nI also requested that Applicant review the Government\u2019s documents and note any \nobjections to any of them, \u201csuch as Item 4, the summary of his personal subject interview \n(specifically noted in the FORM), as well as the other Government documents (his \nclearance application and several credit reports).\u201d I noted that Applicant should submit \nhis documents \u201cby e-mail, in PDF form, to both Mr. Price and me, OR by Fax, by June \n18\u201d and noted that Government Counsel requested a brief period to respond.

That third-party e-mail is marked \nas HE III for the record, but it is not an exhibit, as I did not open the \u201cencrypted message\u201d \nin the attached link, since I did not recognize the source. I gave Applicant until July 12, \n2021, to confirm whether he (or anyone on his behalf) had submitted any new documents \nto DOHA since May 19, 2021.

The only form \nthat I\u2019ve tried to submit were to be via fax. The only form is to be submitted \nis the form request by the administrative judge was the FORM document \nthat contains all material required. I was unsuccessful in reaching everyone \non the form; however, did get in contact with 2 in material presented but no \ndocuments was received to details any and additional information for \nFORM. \nGiven Applicant\u2019s response, I requested that he respond by July 14, 2021, and clarify: 1) \nwhether, after May 19, 2021, he had submitted documents to DOHA by fax; and 2) \nwhether the e-mail from the third-party law firm related to him.

Applicant was on a graduated monthly payment plan of $92 a \nmonth for 24 months, with monthly payments to increase up from $108 to $276 per month, \nover a timeframe from March 2020 until April 2034.

As the \nSupreme Court has held, \u201cthe clearly consistent standard indicates that security \ndeterminations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d Department of the Navy \nv. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 \n2(b) requires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on \nthe evidence contained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences \ngrounded on mere speculation or conjecture. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out, \nin relevant part, in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations.  \nThe Guideline F allegations in the SOR concern two large delinquent federal \nstudent loans and some other past-due accounts. They are all established by Applicant\u2019s \nadmissions and by credit reports in the record, both from 2019. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c) \napply. \nSecurity concerns having been raised, the burden shifted to Applicant to produce \nevidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the security concerns. (Directive \u00b6 \nE3.1.15) An applicant has the burden of proving a mitigating condition, and the burden of \ndisproving it never shifts to the Government. (See ISCR Case No. 02-31154 at 5 (App. \nBd. Sept. 22, 2005)). Applicant has the burden of presenting evidence of explanation, \nextenuation, or mitigation to overcome the financial considerations security concerns. \nThe following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially applicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the person has received or is receiving counseling for the problem from \na legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit counseling \nservice, and there are clear indications that the problem is being resolved \nor is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue.  \nApplicant disputed the legitimacy of the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.f, asserting that \nhe had already paid it, and that he had provided supporting documentation previously. \nThis proved correct, as documentation he submitted at the time of his background \ninterview established that the debt to the auto dealer had been paid in full in 2015. AG \u00b6 \n20(e) applies to mitigate SOR \u00b6 1.f. \nApplicant\u2019s federal student loans, alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b, are unresolved, \nand indeed are greater as of March 2020 (a combined $84,525) than they were in October \n2019 (a combined $54,636, as alleged in the SOR). Payments of Applicant\u2019s federal \nstudent loans are likely suspended due to President Biden\u2019s Executive Order. However, \nthis does not excuse or eliminate the fact that they have been delinquent for years. \nApplicant had a rehabilitation plan in place as of March 2020, but there is no \ndocumentation in the record that he made any payments on either debt alleged in SOR \n\u00b6\u00b6 1.a or 1.b in the time since. There is also nothing in the record to establish their current \nstatus. The debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.d, and 1.e, though much smaller than the \nstudent loans, are also unresolved. \nApplicant also provided little to no information about his recent and current ability \nto repay his debts. His employment history after January 2019 is unclear, and he provided \nno information about his income, expenses, assets, or general finances, information \nwhich might be used to evaluate his overall financial stability. \nApplicant did not provide sufficient information to establish that his financial issues \nare unlikely to recur and no longer cast doubt on his current reliability, trustworthiness, or \ngood judgment. His debts are also ongoing and unresolved. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nThere is no indication that Applicant has participated in financial counseling or that his \ndebts are being resolved or are under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n       \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant did not provide sufficient information to establish that AG \u00b6 20(b) should \napply. He was terminated from his night job at the department store in 2015, and was \nbriefly unemployed in early 2017 after the bookstore closed. Those circumstances may \nhave been beyond his control but they are also now several years ago, and Applicant did \nnot establish that his finances continue to be negatively affected as a result. Even if that \nwere the case, he did not establish that he undertook reasonable action to address his \ndebts under the circumstances. AG \u00b6 20(b) does not apply. \nApplicant referenced agreements made with some of his creditors (the federal \nstudent-loan debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b and the debt alleged in SOR \u00b6 1.c) but \nhe did not provide any documentation that he had made any payments in compliance with \nthose agreements. He claimed that he was not financially able to make payments to \nresolve the debts alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e. His limited and dated actions do not \nestablish that he has a reasonable plan to resolve his debts or that he has taken any \nmeaningful steps towards doing so. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall common sense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. My comments under Guideline F are incorporated in my whole-\nperson analysis. Under AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility \nfor a security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nApplicant has a long history of financial instability. He did not meet his burden to \nestablish that his debts are under control, are being resolved, or that he is addressing \nthem in a responsible way. Applicant\u2019s debts will remain a security concern until he shows \na documented track record of good-faith efforts to resolve them. Overall, the record \nevidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to Applicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_______________________ \nfor a security clearance.

    "summary": "Findings of Fact Applicant is a 42-year-old install technician. He is divorced and has no children. Applicant is presently engaged to marry. The couple live together in a rented apartment and share expenses. (Tr. 18) Applicant makes a monthly payment of $400 for his automobile. After taxes, Applicant earns approximately $62,400 a year. He has no recent periods of unemployment. Coming from a military family, Applicant aspired to military service. He served in the military for a \u201ccouple of months\u201d before being honorably discharged in the late 1990s due to medical issues. (Tr. 8, 20) He was previously vetted and granted a security clearance, including a top-secret clearance granted in 2018. He earned an associate\u2019s degree in 2014. He has outstanding federal student loans totaling approximately $35,000 dating back to his associate degree studies, circa 2011-2014. He admits all allegations related to his student loans (SOR allegations 1.a, 1.c-1.h), but denied knowledge of a medical debt for $639 (SOR allegation 1.b). The debt at 1.a has been paid and Applicant does not recognize, and cannot validate, the debt at 1.b. (Tr. 64-65) When Applicant first started his associate\u2019s degree program, he met with a financial officer at the institution. (Tr. 22) His education was to be financed through the school and through government student loans. During his program, he paid the school about $175 per month toward his school-based loan.

With no objections, all exhibits were accepted into the \nrecord. On April 5, 2021, Applicant submitted four exhibits (AExs.) A-D via email. With no \nobjections, all documents were accepted. The transcript of the proceeding (Tr.) was \nreceived on April 7, 2021. The record was closed on April 16, 2021. Based on the \ntestimony, materials, and record as a whole, I find Applicant mitigated financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 42-year-old install technician. He is divorced and has no children. \nApplicant is presently engaged to marry. The couple live together in a rented apartment \nand share expenses. (Tr. 18) Applicant makes a monthly payment of $400 for his \nautomobile. After taxes, Applicant earns approximately $62,400 a year. He has no recent \nperiods of unemployment. \nComing from a military family, Applicant aspired to military service. He served in \nthe military for a \u201ccouple of months\u201d before being honorably discharged in the late 1990s \ndue to medical issues. (Tr. 8, 20) He was previously vetted and granted a security \nclearance, including a top-secret clearance granted in 2018. He earned an associate\u2019s \ndegree in 2014. He has outstanding federal student loans totaling approximately $35,000 \ndating back to his associate degree studies, circa 2011-2014. He admits all allegations \nrelated to his student loans (SOR allegations 1.a, 1.c-1.h), but denied knowledge of a \nmedical debt for $639 (SOR allegation 1.b). The debt at 1.a has been paid and Applicant \ndoes not recognize, and cannot validate, the debt at 1.b. (Tr. 64-65) \nWhen Applicant first started his associate\u2019s degree program, he met with a \nfinancial officer at the institution. (Tr. 22) His education was to be financed through the \nschool and through government student loans. During his program, he paid the school \nabout $175 per month toward his school-based loan. (Tr. 24) By graduation in 2014, he \nhad settled his obligation to the institution and accepted a job offer. (Tr. 26-27) At that \npoint, he accepted a brief deferment on his federal student loans before he started making \n$175 monthly payments toward them via the telephone. Soon, the government was \nasking for monthly payments of $375 to $425 a month. (Tr. 27-30) \nAt the time, Applicant was unable to pay more than $175 a month toward his \nfederal student loans (Tr. 28) He was making about $42,000 a year and living with his \nparents, who were having health issues and needed his assistance. They lived in a costly \nregion. After three to six months, he ultimately ceased making payments on these \ngovernment-backed student loans. Meanwhile, between 2014 and 2018, Applicant \nprovided his parents with spare money and time to help with their declining health, \nmedical expenses, and care. (Tr. 55-56) These expenses increased when his mother was \ndiagnosed with Stage 4 cancer. Spare funds were also expended toward the health \nissues of both his sibling and himself. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn the interim, Applicant tried to get his federal student loans removed on the theory \nthat the institution had subsequently lost its accreditation. (Tr. 32) He believed this made \nhis diploma invalid. He thought this notion to be true when he was later told by another \nschool that they would not accept credits from his prior school because it had lost its \naccreditation. (Tr. 35-36) However, after researching the issue, Applicant found that he \nwas still liable for the related federal student loans because the school was still accredited \nat the time of his 2014 graduation. (Tr. 37) \nApplicant then believed the obligation had disappeared when his 2017 or 2018 \ncredit report showed the accounts as closed. (Tr. 33-34) He filed an inquiry with the \ngovernment concerning these loans in 2018, but never received a response. (Tr. 38) He \nwas alerted to the fact the student loans were still owed during a March 2019 investigative \ninterview and review of a different credit report. (Ex. 2) Confused, Applicant researched \nfurther. He consulted two organizations which promised they could put him on the path to \nsome form of loan forgiveness. Indeed, he paid one of the entities $600 for its services. \nSoon, however, he suspected these organizations to be conducting scams. (Tr. 73) \nApplicant then found a government contractor in the business of counseling and \nassisting people regarding federal student loan repayment. He started working with it in \n2020. He enrolled in its program in October 2020 with payment of $300 and entered into \nan agreement to start repayments in September 2021, at the end of a current program \ncreated to relieve student loan holders from their obligations during the recent global \npandemic. At present, he is both financially able and motivated to meet his obligations \nunder that program. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person. This includes information that is both \nfavorable and unfavorable. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence.  \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and \nconfidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions necessarily \ninclude consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently \nfail to safeguard such information. Finally, these decisions shall be in terms of the national \ninterest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant. \nAnalysis \nUnder Guideline F, AG \u00b6 18 sets forth that the security concern under this guideline \nis that failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by \nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.  \nHere, the Government offered documentary evidence reflecting that Applicant has \nacquired multiple delinquent debts, mostly in the form of student loans. Under these \ncircumstances, two financial considerations disqualifying conditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts, and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nConditions that could mitigate the finance-related security concerns posed here \ninclude: \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problems from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or under control; and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 20(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant timely repaid his student loans to his school, but his federal student loans \nremained after graduation. Based on his income and expenses, he received a brief \ndeferment on repaying his government loans, but he was unable to pay the full amount \nrequested by the government when that period ended due to insufficient income, his need \nto financially help his ailing parents, and the local cost of living. \n          In addition, Applicant began to question whether he actually owed the government \nstudent loans after the school lost its accreditation. Ultimately, his investigation revealed \nthe debts remained valid. He was again distracted from the federal student loans when \nthey appeared as closed on his credit report. Ultimately, in 2019, an investigator showed \nhim the debts were still existent. After attempting to deal with them through two \norganizations he ultimately found to be either scams or of dubious quality, he found a \ngovernment contractor that served not only as a counselor but as a conduit through which \nhe could seek to eliminate his debts through a structured, government-approved plan. In \n2020, he was relieved of payments due to a program instituted to provide financial relief \nduring the height of the global pandemic. At the end of the program, he will transition to \nits structured repayment plan, effective September 2021.  Under these facts, AG \u00b6 20(b)-\n(d) apply. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of his conduct and \nall relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative \nprocess factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). Here, I have considered those factors. I am also \nmindful that, under AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \na security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based on a careful \nconsideration of both the administrative guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nIn this case, Applicant was distracted from his direct payment on his government \nstudent loans for a few years due to multiple complications, including insufficient income \nin a costly region, ill parents, and the questionable status of his former school. The facts \nand his credible testimony, however, show that he never attempted to purposefully avoid \nhonoring his debts. Each distraction was eventually overcome and followed by attempts \nat corrective action. Today, he is relieved of loan payment due to a temporary scheme to \naid individuals during the recent global pandemic. Through the proper channels, he has \nset himself up to start regular, automatic payments through a recognized organization \nwhen that scheme comes to an end this summer. In light of these considerations, I find \nfinancial considerations security concerns are mitigated. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n   Formal Findings \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \n \n \nFOR APPLICANT \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.h: \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n                 \n \n \n     Conclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance.

He has served in \nthat capacity since April 2019. He currently maintains a security clearance. Applicant \ngraduated high school and attended some college. He was honorably discharged from \nthe United State military in 2004 at the rank of E-6 after 21 years of service. \nTwice divorced, Applicant has one adult child. He married his second wife, a \nmedical therapist, in 2004. During their marriage, they bought a duplex in a distant state \nas an investment and rental property. (Tr. 32) During their marriage, Applicant\u2019s wife \nmanaged the bills, including matters related to real estate. (Tr. 50) Applicant divorced this \nwife in mid-2015 after a 15-month separation. Applicant was locked out of the marital \nhome in September 2015 by an unknown individual or entity. (Tr. 19) He quickly moved \ninto an apartment within the regionally high-priced rental market, then to a less expensive \nunit to save money. (Tr. 19) \nIn mid-2016, Applicant started a two-year period of unemployment after losing a \njob. (Tr. 26-30) Initially released from his job for cause, Applicant disputed the reasons \ncited. The matter was appealed, favorably reviewed, and some back pay was restored. \nIn the interim, he sent applications to \u201cquite a few\u201d potential employers without success. \n(Tr. 31) Meanwhile, his ex-wife declared Chapter 13 bankruptcy. It appears at least two \naccounts noted in the SOR were referenced in her bankruptcy or their divorce paperwork. \nApplicant has acquired several delinquent debts. Reference was made during the \nhearing to several credit reports. It was noted that some of the reports contained \nerroneous information, such as incorrect home addresses, or accounts balances that are \nslightly off. Applicant believes these errors could be more numerous than he has cited. \n(see Tr. 65-72) At issue in the SOR are the following debts: \n1.a - $64,119 charged-off account \u2013 This is related to a second mortgage account. \n(Tr. 60) Applicant is not familiar with either entity referenced in this allegation. Such \nmatters were exclusively handled by his now ex-wife. He is unaware of any relevant facts \nregarding this debt for the same reasons noted, below, at 1.g. He has searched, but has \nfound no documentation regarding the account among his scant records. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n1.b - $14,255 charged-off account \u2013 Applicant admits responsibility for this\ndelinquent debt, which is related to a 60-month duration personal loan he got in November \n2014. (Tr. 66) He took the loan in order to pay his divorce attorney while he was \nunemployed. (Tr. 66) The matter has since been referred for collection and the legal firm \ncontinues to refuse to work with him on a repayment plan. (Tr. 67) Some of the materials \nshow a sum slightly different than the one at issue, the result of harmless error in terms \nof whether the debt remains owed; Applicant disputes these inaccuracies. (Tr. 65-75) \n \n1.c - $13,227 charged-off account \u2013 The account is related to a car loan on which \nApplicant cosigned in 2013 for his now ex-wife. Unbeknownst to Applicant, the car was \nultimately repossessed as the couple\u2019s divorce was pending, which explains why the auto \nwas not noted in the final divorce decree. (Tr. 77, 79) After being interviewed by \ninvestigators, Applicant tried to contact the lender, but nobody would speak with him. (Tr. \n84) However, the account is referenced in his ex-wife\u2019s bankruptcy petition for this \namount. (GEx. 6; AEx. 2)  \n1.d - $16,237 charged-off account \u2013 Applicant states that he discussed this\naccount with the lender, who offered to cancel the obligation once it verified Applicant had \nno income at the time to make payments toward its satisfaction. While there is no record \nthat this is what occurred, there is documentary evidence showing the debt was cancelled \nin February 2018. (Tr. 85) The related 1099-C tax form was submitted with Applicant\u2019s \nexcerpts of his tax materials at the hearing. (Tr. 85-86; AEx. 1)   \n1.e \u2013 2017 foreclosure \u2013 Here, the underlying mortgage was related to an\ninvestment rental duplex property purchased during his second marriage in a distant \nstate. His ex-wife exclusively managed this property and the handling of the mortgage. \nThe last payment on this property was made in March 2014, around the time Applicant \nand his wife separated and while Applicant was still working. It went into foreclosure and \nwas auctioned in November 2014. (Tr. 89) Applicant has no idea what his then-estranged \nwife was doing with their bills after she moved out at the beginning of their separation. He \nhas no knowledge of what happened to the property or the underlying loan. (Tr. 91)  \n1.f - $190 medical collection \u2013 Because Applicant uses TRICARE medical\ninsurance, he does not know how this medical collection account came into being or was \nnot disposed of by his insurer. (Tr. 92) He spoke with TRCARE, which had no record of \na collection account. (Tr. 92-93) Any sums needed to satisfy TRICARE come from his \nretirement fund. (Tr. 94) Applicant assumes this credit report entry is an error as he is \nsure he has no outstanding medical bills. (Tr. 94, 96) He has not disputed the matter with \nthe listed creditor or any of the credit reporting bureaus.       \n1.g - 2017 Mortgage Foreclosure \u2013 This concerns the same property underlying \nthe debt noted above at 1.a. (Tr. 62) Applicant knows little about this property. His wife \nmanaged all related payments and bills. Applicant was unemployed at the time when the \nproperty went into default and foreclosure. Unbeknownst to Applicant, it went into \nforeclosure in February 2017. (Tr. 52-53; GEx. 10 at 4) Matters related to this property \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwere not \u201cwithin [his] scope of monitoring.\u201d (Tr. 61) In addition, he was locked out of the \nproperty in 2015, as noted above, and he does not know what happened after he was \nforced out of the home. He has never been contacted about this property or its disposition. \nHe has no paperwork regarding the property. (Tr. 51) His wife was undergoing Chapter \n13 bankruptcy proceedings at the time. (Tr. 52, 60) Applicant\u2019s only record regarding the \nproperties is a note between two apparent attorneys discussing their accumulation of \nvarious records regarding the couple\u2019s marital properties and the car purchased in 2013. \n(Ex. B) \nAt present, Applicant earns a gross salary of approximately $79,000 a year, or \nabout $6,600 per month. He generates an additional monthly gross of $1,000 from his \nmilitary retirement and about $600 each month in disability payments. Sums owed to him \nby his last wife under their divorce decree have not been received because he \u201cis still \nchasing [her] down. . . .\u201d (Tr. 36) He has under $1,000 in his checking account and an \namount over $8,000 in his savings account. (Tr. 38) The sole credit card he presently \nmaintains is in good standing. (Tr. 96) The present balance mainly represents additional \npayments to his divorce attorney. (Tr. 97) He does not regularly check his credit report \nbecause he prefers to pay cash and he is not anticipating needing credit at this time. (Tr. \n95) \nApplicant\u2019s monthly rent is between $1,800 and $1,900. He owns a 2003 vehicle \nwith over 210,000 miles on the odometer and a 2017 automobile he purchased in 2020 \nwith over 30,000 miles on the odometer. His monthly payment on the 2017 car is about \n$425. After all expenses, Applicant has a net monthly remainder of $1,000. He pays his \nregular and routine bills on time. Applicant is not a gambler and rarely plays the lottery. \nHe seldom eats out and spends little on meals. (Tr. 46-47) He has received financial \ncounseling. (Tr. 49) He maintains a relatively Spartan existence consistent with his \nlifestyle when single and in the military. (see, e.g., Tr. 107) Applicant noted, \u201cI don\u2019t spend \na lot of money. I don\u2019t make a lot of money.\u201d (Tr. 107) \nApplicant stressed that he has never been \u201cbad\u201d with money, noting \u201cmy ex-wife \nwas bad with money.\u201d (Tr. 87) He is prepared to file bankruptcy regarding the main \naccounts noted in the SOR if his ex-wife\u2019s current Chapter 13 bankruptcy action does not \nsatisfy them. (Tr. 106) As he has no contact with his ex-wife and he is unable to find her, \nhe has no sense of whether she is still making timely payments on her bankruptcy plan. \n(Tr. 106-107) \nIn closing, Applicant stated: \nI worked for the government all my life. . . . And I don\u2019t know what to tell you \nguys. It\u2019s just . . . it\u2019s sad. . . . But if I say I eat to survive, I eat to survive. I \ndidn\u2019t go on trips because I wanted to go on trips. . . . my bills weren\u2019t able \nto be paid because I\u2019ve got to keep a roof over my head, one of the \nquestions that you didn\u2019t ask was, during that time that you were \nunemployed, how much was your rent then? . . . . That will take a chunk out \nof every penny that you have. [For two years while unemployed] I started \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \nteaching kids, 12-year olds . . . every day.

I\u2019ve been trying to get her to court, but I can\u2019t seem to locate \nher. (Tr. 109-110) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person. This includes information that is both \nfavorable and unfavorable. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified \ninformation will be resolved in favor of national security. In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and \nconfidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions necessarily \ninclude consideration of the possible risk an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently \nfail to safeguard such information. Finally, these decisions shall be in terms of the national \ninterest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant. \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nUnder Guideline F, AG \u00b6 18 sets forth that the security concern under this guideline \nis that failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or unwillingness to abide by \nrules and regulations, all of which can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive information.  \nHere, the Government offered documentary evidence reflecting that Applicant has \nacquired multiple delinquent debts. They include past-due commercial accounts, \ndelinquent mortgages, and a foreclosure. Under these circumstances, two financial \nconsiderations disqualifying conditions apply: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts, and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nOne condition could mitigate the finance-related security concerns posed here: \nAG \u00b6 20(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances.  \nThe actual creation of the delinquent debts at issue are at least partly the result of \ncircumstances beyond Applicant\u2019s control. A marital separation in early 2014 led to a \ndivorce in mid-2015. His being abruptly locked out of his home for no apparent reason in \nSeptember 2015 led to his immediate need for an apartment in a costly rental market. He \nthen attempted to reduce this financial burden by relocating to less expensive housing. In \nmid-2016, Applicant was let go from his job, allegedly for cause, which led to two years \nof unemployment. During this period, he unsuccessfully looked for regular employment \nand did some teaching. He was ultimately reinstated in his position with some back-pay \nrestored after a protracted appeal process.  \nSince that time period, Applicant says he has tried to find his ex-wife, for whom or \nwith whom some of the delinquent debts at issue were jointly incurred. However, there is \nno documentary evidence to that effect. As a result, there seems to be at least two years \nof inactivity in addressing his delinquent debts, actively working with his creditors, or \ncontacting the credit reporting agencies to validate the debts at issue or dispute them. \nMeanwhile, the only progress on Applicant\u2019s debt seems to come from a creditor\u2019s action \nto cancel his obligation. Consequently, I find that AG \u00b6 20(b) only applies in part. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, an administrative judge \nmust evaluate an applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by \n \nconsidering the totality of his conduct and all relevant circumstances. The \nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors \n \nlisted at AG \u00b6 2(d). Here, I have considered those factors. I am also \n  \n \n \n \n \nmindful that, under AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to \n \n \ngrant eligibility for a \nsecurity \nclearance \nmust \nbe \nan \noverall \ncommonsense judgment based on a careful consideration of both the \nadministrative guidelines and the whole-person concept. \n \n \nApplicant is a 60-year-old executive level, executive assistant earning \na gross salary of slightly under $80,000. He has a high school education \n \n \nand attended some college-level courses. Applicant honorably served \n \n \n \nin the United States military for 21 years, retiring at the rank of E-6. He \n \n \n \ncurrently maintains a security clearance. He is the father of one adult \n \n \nchild. His second wife divorced him in 2015. This ex-wife then filed for \n \nChapter 13 bankruptcy protection, and has since disappeared. Applicant \n \n \nstates that he is trying to find her to resolve financial issues remaining \n \n \nunder their divorce decree, but he has thus far been unsuccessful. \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFurthermore, Applicant showed that he has sufficient net income to \n \n \n \nmake at least minimal strides toward debts resolution either directly or \n \n \n \nwith the help of a debt resolution specialist or financial counselor. To date, \n \n \n \n \nthere has been no movement in that direction. Rather, Applicant seems \n \nfocused on waiting for his wife to return, hoping she may have satisfied \n \n \nsome of the delinquent debts at issue herself. This process does not \n \n \n \nrequire an Applicant to demonstrate that his delinquent debts have all \nbeen satisfied. It does, however, expect that one has successfully \nimplemented a genuine, workable, and realistic plan or strategy \n situation designed to resolve one\u2019s delinquent debts. Applicant\u2019s approach \n to his delinquent debt does not rise to this threshold. In light of \n these considerations, I find financial considerations security concerns \n remain unmitigated. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAlthough Applicant testified that he initiated contact with a couple \n \nof his creditors to discuss his debts or otherwise address his obligations, \n \n \nhe presented no documentation reflecting such efforts. He was unable to \n \n \nfind sufficient paperwork regarding his ex-wife\u2019s car and the properties \n-\n \nwhich they co-owned. It appears he has not investigated the medical debt \n \n \nat issue or formally disputed it with either the provider or one of the \n \nleading credit reporting agencies. Moreover, besides the lack of \n \n \ndocumentation submitted by Applicant to show genuine effort toward \n \nthe resolution of his delinquent debt, there is simply no documentary \n \nevidence reflecting any progress on his delinquent debts except the 1099-\n C cancellation of one account obligation. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   Formal Findings \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                 \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.d:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.e-1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nArthur E.

Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation Within Industry (February 20, 1960); Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program, DoD Directive 5220.6 (January 2, 1992) (Directive); and \nSecurity Executive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. \n1 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApplicant responded to the SOR on January 18, 2021, and elected to have his \ncase decided on the basis of the written record, in lieu of a hearing. Applicant received \nthe File of Relevant Material (FORM) on April 14, 2021, and interposed no objections to \nthe materials in the FORM. Within the time permitted, Applicant timely supplemented \nthe record with a May 2020 credit report which was admitted without objection as Item \n11 for consideration. (Item 11)  \nSummary of Pleadings \nUnder Guideline F, Applicant allegedly (a) failed to file his federal and state \nincome tax returns for tax year 2017 as required; (b) accumulated 18 delinquent student \nloan accounts exceeding $185,000; (c) accumulated five delinquent consumer debts \nexceeding $14,000, and (d) accrued three delinquent medical debts approximating \n$552. Allegedly, the listed tax-filing lapses and delinquent debts listed in the SOR \nremain unresolved and outstanding. \nUnder Guideline E, Applicant allegedly (a) incurred traffic-related convictions in \nJuly 2017 and November 2018, respectively, for driving on a suspended license and (b) \nhad his driver\u2019s license suspended in March 2019 with a driving record that reflected 13 \ndemerit points from his state\u2019s department of motor vehicles (DMV). \nIn his response to the SOR, Applicant admitted each of the allegations covered in \nGuidelines F and E with explanations. He claimed he erroneously believed he had filed \nhis 2017 federal and state income tax returns with his 2018 tax returns and expressed \nhis intention to file his 2017 returns by June 2020. \nApplicant also claimed in his response that most of his student loan debts had \nbeen charged off on his credit reports or remain in delinquent status. He further claimed \nthat he was considering repayment options for addressing his delinquent student loan \ndebts. is remaining student loan debts (covered by SOR \u00b6 \u00b6 1.c-1.k, 1.m-1.o, 1.q, and \n1.s-1.w), and is evaluating his payment options. And, he claimed that his remaining \nmedical (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.r, 1.x, and 1.z) and consumer (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.p, 1.y, and 1.aa) debts \nhave since been paid and are no longer valid debts. \nAddressing the personal conduct allegations, Applicant affirmed that he is \ncurrently living in another state and is uncertain what steps he will take to regain his \nstate license in the state he has abandoned should he decide to regain his residency in \nthe state. All he would assure is that make sure his driving privileges have been \nrestored. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is a 34-year-old software test engineer for a defense contractor who \nseeks continuation of his security clearance.

(Item 4) He earned a high \nschool diploma in June 2005. Between August 2006 and December 2012, he attended \ncollege classes and reported earning a bachelor\u2019s degree. (Item 4) Applicant reported \nno military service. \nSince August 2018, Applicant has been employed by his current employer as a \nsoftware test engineer. He reported brief periods of unemployment in 2014 and 2018 \nand worked for various defense and non-defense contractors in the software \nengineering field between 2010 and 2018. (Item 4) \nApplicant\u2019s finances  \nApplicant failed to timely file his federal and state income tax returns for tax year \n2017. (Items 2-3) He attributed his filing failures to being unaware of his filing lapses \nuntil he received the SOR. (Item 2) He assured that he is working to rectify his federal \nand state tax filing lapses by filing both sets of returns by June 2020. (Item 2) Records \nconfirm his failure to file his 2017 federal and state tax returns as required. \nApplicant provided no documentary information that he has filed his 2017 federal and \nstate tax returns as he committed to doing at the close of the record.  \nBetween 2006 and 2019 Applicant accumulated a number of delinquent student \nloan debts. Altogether, he accrued 18 delinquent student loans (covered by SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c\u00ad\n1.k, 1.m -1.o, and 1.q-1.w), exceeding the sum of $185,000. With the payment options, \nhe verbally received from the DoE, Applicant is considering his options of either \npursuing loan rehabilitation steps with the DoE or exploring a repayment option with a \nprivate lender. (item 2) \nTo date, Applicant has provided no updates on his plans for resolving his student \nloan delinquencies. While most of these delinquent student loan accounts have either \nbeen charged off or referred to collection (Items 5-7 and 11), they have not been \nvoluntarily addressed by Applicant and remain unresolved and outstanding accounts. \nBesides his delinquent student loan accounts, Applicant accumulated a number \nof delinquent medical and consumer accounts. Credit reports document three \ndelinquent medical accounts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.r 1.x, and 1.z), totaling $552. (Items 5-7) \nReported delinquent consumer debts (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.l, 1.p, 1.y, and 1.aa) exceeding \n$14,000. (Items 5-7)  \nLike Applicant\u2019s delinquent student loan debts, his delinquent medical and \nconsumer debts have either been charged off or placed in collection status. (Items 5-7 \nand 11) However, these delinquent accounts have not been resolved by Applicant to \ndate with payments and payment plans and remain unresolved and outstanding. \n3 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe largest consumer debt covered by the SOR is a reported delinquent balance \non a car repossession that is referenced by SOR \u00b61.l for $10,932. (Items 5-7) Once \nsued by the creditor who repossessed his vehicle in May 2019, Applicant entered into a \nwritten settlement agreement to begin repaying the debt. (Item 7) Once Applicant \ndefaulted on this agreement, the creditor filed an affidavit of non-compliance. (Item 7) \nBased on the creditor\u2019s affidavit of non-compliance, the court entered judgment against \nApplicant in June 2019 in the amount of $10,932. (Item 8) Applicant has provided no \ndocumented proof of his satisfying the judgment\u2019s terms. \nAbsent documentation from Applicant of his addressing his 2017 tax filing lapses \nand delinquent student loan, medical, and consumer debts with pay-offs and payment \nplans, or providing documentation of his successfully resolving his disputes with the \ncreditors of the debts he challenges by other means, resolution of Applicant\u2019s tax filing \nlapses and listed delinquent accounts cannot be favorably established. Worth noting, \nApplicant\u2019s post-FORM credit report submission provides no probative evidence of his \ninitiating any voluntary efforts to resolve his debts. \nApplicant\u2019s traffic-related offenses \nRecords document that between 2017 and 2018, Applicant was charged with \ndriving on a suspended license. (item 8) In March 2019, Applicant \u2018s driver\u2019s license was \nsuspended and his driving record was noted to reflect 13 demerit points from his state \ndepartment of motor vehicles (DMV). (Items 9-10) Applicant admitted the allegations \nand provided a May 2020 letter from his state\u2019s DMV explaining how he was ineligible to \ndrive in his state of residence until he satisfied imposed licensing conditions: completion \nof a driver improvement course, attendance of an intervention interview, and payment of \na $185 reinstatement fee. (Item 2) \nIn his SOR response, Applicant expressed uncertainty over what steps he would \ntake to regain his state driver\u2019s license in his previous state of residence. He committed \nonly to taking required steps to regain his driving privileges in the event he moved back \nto his previous state of residence.

An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making \nprocess covering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could \ncreate a potential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as \nconsiderations that could affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified information. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a \nsecurity concern and may be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of \nthe conditions that could mitigate security concerns, if any. These AG guidelines must \nbe considered before deciding whether or not a security clearance should be granted, \ncontinued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not require judges to place exclusive \nreliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating conditions in the guidelines in \narriving at a decision. \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context \nof the whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period \nof an applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the \napplicant is an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nThe Concern: Failure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of \nwhich \ncan \nraise \nquestions \nabout \nan \nindividual\u2019s \nreliability, \ntrustworthiness, and ability to protect classified or sensitive \ninformation.

AG \u00b6 18. \nPersonal Conduct \nThe Concern: Conduct involving questionable judgment, lack of \ncandor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules and regulations \ncan raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. Of special interest is \nany failure to cooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during \nnational security investigative or adjudicative processes. . .  . AG \u00b6 15. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nClearance decisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be \na determination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in \nthe personal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant \nfrom being eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden \nof establishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d   See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the \ncriteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 \nat 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts.

His admitted tax filing failures and  debt delinquencies \nare fully documented and create  judgement issues as well over the management of his \nfinances. See ISCR Case No. 03-01059 at 3 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2004) \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified and sensitive \ninformation is required to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security \nclearance that entitles the person to access classified and sensitive information. While \nthe principal concern of a security clearance holder\u2019s demonstrated financial difficulties \nis vulnerability to coercion to classified information or to holding sensitive position, \njudgment and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving debt delinquencies. \nHistorically, the timing and resolving of debt delinquencies are critical to an \nassessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability and good judgment in following \nrules, regulations, and guidelines necessary for those seeking access to classified and \nsensitive information or to holding a sensitive position.

These concerns require considerable documentary support from Applicant \nto extenuate and mitigate them. \nExtenuating circumstances played a very minimal evidentiary role in Applicant\u2019s \naccumulation of delinquent accounts. Gainfully employed since August 2018, he \nprovided little information as to why or how he has been unable to file his 2017 federal \nand state tax returns and address his debts with payments and payment plans.

Based on his failure to date to establish a meaningful track record \nof addressing his delinquent accounts, it is too soon to make safe predictive \nassessments as to whether Applicant can restore his finances to stable levels \nconsistent with minimum requirements for holding a security clearance. \nPersonal conduct concerns \nThe Government\u2019s personal conduct concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s \nserious breaches of highway rules and regulations. Applicant\u2019s 2017 and 2018 traffic \noffenses, while misdemeanors, represent major lapses in judgment by Applicant. The \ncombined traffic-related offenses and ensuing driving suspension (reflecting 13 demerit \npoints) share a common thread of security concerns over questionable exercises in \njudgment. These collective errors in judgment, when stitched together contextually, \nreflect an overall pattern of poor judgment, unreliability, and untrustworthiness under the \npersonal conduct guideline. \nBased on the evidence produced on this written record, one of the DCs covered \nby the personal conduct guideline is applicable to the developed facts in evidence. DC \u00b6 \n16(d), \u201ccredible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any other \nguideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse determination, but which, \nwhen combined with all available information, supports an overall assessment of \nquestionable judgment, untrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to \ncomply with rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual \nmay not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. This includes, but is not \nlimited to, consideration of . . . (3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations. . . .,\u201d \napplies to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nApplicant\u2019s 2017-2018 traffic-related incidents reflect multiple lapses of judgment \nand maturity. When considered together in this context, the two SOR-covered incidents \nsupport a troubling pattern of questionable judgment, untrustworthiness, and \nunreliability, properly alleged and pursued under Guideline E. \nIn the past, the Appeal Board has addressed traffic-related offenses stitched \ntogether to \nraise \nsecurity \nconcerns \nover an \napplicant\u2019s \noverall \njudgment, \ntrustworthiness, and reliability.

Like \nthe traffic-related instances cited in ISCR Case No. 03-08475, Applicant\u2019s two traffic-\nrelated offenses could be expected to fall into minor categories if assessed individually. \nConsidered together with his lack of demonstrated financial responsibility associated \nwith his tax-filing lapses and delinquent account accruals, his traffic offenses become \npart of a concerning pattern of judgment neglect. \nOther Appeal Board cases cited by the Government involving multiple traffic-\nrelated offenses also sustained clearance denials for reasons of demonstrated lack of\noverall judgment sufficient to raise security concerns over applicant\u2019s cited inability to \nfollow rules and regulations over a prolonged period of years.  See ISCR Case No. 11-\n14899 at 1-3 (App. Bd. April 15, 2015; ISCR Case No. 10-0928 at 4 (App. Bd. March 5,\n2012)  \n \n \nWhile time is on Applicant\u2019s side with his location to another state, he has not \ndemonstrated the level of maturity and judgment required for safe driving on the nation\u2019s \nroads and highways to ensure he will be able to exercise sound judgment when asked \nto safeguard classified and sensitive information entrusted to him. Potentially applicable \nmitigating conditions, accordingly, are not available to Applicant at this time. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his history of tax filing lapses of judgment, accumulation of \ndelinquent debts, and involvement in serious breaches of highway safety, when taken \ntogether contextually, reflect trust, reliability, and judgment concerns incompatible with \nthe fiduciary duties associated with holding a security clearance. Further assessment of \nApplicant\u2019s overall qualifications for holding a security clearance is needed to make safe \npredictive judgments about Applicant\u2019s clearance worthiness, \nEvaluation of Applicant\u2019s clearance eligibility in this case requires consideration \nof whether Applicant\u2019s failure to adequately address his tax filing lapses, account \ndelinquencies, and safe driving responsibilities, when accessing his state\u2019s roads and \nhighways, are otherwise compatible with DoD requirements for holding a security \nclearance. While Applicant is entitled to credit for his contributions to the defense \nindustry, his employment contributions are not enough at this time to overcome his \naccumulated delinquent tax filing breaches and debt delinquencies, and driving \nrepeatedly on a suspended driver\u2019s license in his former state of residence. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person.

(AE M; AE O) Applicant is one of his \u201cmost dependable \nemployees,\u201d a team player, and a \u201ctremendous asset\u201d to the contractor. (AE O) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \n5 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). \u201cIt means such \nrelevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a \nconclusion.\u201d Richardson v. Perales, 402 U.S. 389, 401 (1971) (citation omitted). The \nguidelines presume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of \nthe criteria listed therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-\n0611 at 2 (App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \n6 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(b) and 19(c). Further \ninformation is in the mitigation section, infra. \nAG \u00b6 20 lists financial considerations mitigating conditions which may be applicable \nin this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control;  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and   \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991).

The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires \nremoval of most negative financial items from a credit report seven years from the first \ndate of delinquency or the debt becoming collection barred because of a state statute of \nlimitations, whichever is longer. See Title 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c; Federal Trade Commission \nwebsite, Summary of Fair Credit Reporting Act Updates at Section 605, \nhttps://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0111-fair-credit-reporting-act.pdf. Debts may \nbe dropped from a credit report upon dispute when creditors believe the debt is not going \nto be paid, a creditor fails to timely respond to a credit reporting company\u2019s request for \ninformation, or when the debt has been charged off. \nState statutes of limitations for various types of debts range from 2 to 10 years. \nSee Nolo Law for All website, Chart: Statutes of Limitations in All 50 States, \nhttp://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/statute-of-limitations-state-laws-chart-\n29941.html. According to the Federal Trade Commission, Consumer Information \nwebpage, it is illegal under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act for a creditor to threaten \nto sue to collect a time-barred debt. http://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0117-time\u00ad\nbarred-debts. CRC2 told Applicant that the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c was not collectible because \nof the statute of limitations, and it does not appear on his most recent credit report. The \ncreditor could have preserved this debt by obtaining a judgment against Appellant; \nhowever, there is no evidence that the creditor in SOR \u00b6 1.c took judicial action to pursue \n8 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncollection of this debt. The South Carolina Court of Appeals succinctly explained the \nsocietal and judicial value of application of the statute of limitations: \nStatutes of limitations embody important public policy considerations in that \nthey stimulate activity, punish negligence and promote repose by giving \nsecurity and stability to human affairs. The cornerstone policy consideration \nunderlying statutes of limitations is the laudable goal of law to promote and \nachieve finality in litigation. Significantly, statutes of limitations provide \npotential defendants with certainty that after a set period of time, they will \nnot be [haled] into court to defend time-barred claims. Moreover, limitations \nperiods discourage plaintiffs from sitting on their rights. Statutes of \nlimitations are, indeed, fundamental to our judicial system. \nCarolina Marine Handling, Inc. v. Lasch, 363 S.C. 169, 175-76, 609 S.E.2d 548, 552 (S.C. \nCt. App. 2005) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). South Carolina case law \nis not binding on state courts where Applicant resided; however, the South Carolina Court \nof Appeals\u2019 description of the basis for this long-standing legal doctrine is instructive. See \nalso Tulsa Professional Collection Services, Inc. v. Pope, 485 U.S. 478, 486 (1988) \n(where the U.S. Supreme Court noted that \u201cThe State\u2019s interest in a self-executing statute \nof limitations is in providing repose for potential defendants and in avoiding stale claims.\u201d). \nWhile Applicant\u2019s reliance on CRC2\u2019s recommendation for disposition of SOR \u00b6 1.c may \nbe sound financial advice, it is not sound advice in a security context because debtors \nare expected to repay their debts if they have the financial means to do so. In this \ninstance, Applicant lacked the means until recently to repay and resolve his delinquent \ndebts. He relied on CRC2\u2019s advice while he was deployed to the Middle East to resolve \nhis debts. This reliance was misplaced in regard to security concerns. \nThe Appeal Board has previously explained what constitutes a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort \nto repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts: \nIn order to qualify for application of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition], an \napplicant must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving the \napplicant\u2019s debts. The Directive does not define the term \u201cgood-faith.\u201d \nHowever, the Board has indicated that the concept of good-faith \u201crequires \na showing that a person acts in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation.\u201d Accordingly, an \napplicant must do more than merely show that he or she relied on a legally \navailable option (such as bankruptcy [or the statute of limitations]) in order \nto claim the benefit of [the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating condition]. \n \n \nISCR Case No. 02-30304 at 3 (App. Bd. Apr. 20, 2004) (quoting ISCR Case No. 99-9020 \nat 5-6 (App. Bd. June 4, 2001) (internal citation and footnote omitted)). Applicant showed \ngood faith when he resolved 10 of 11 SOR debts. I found his statement at his hearing to \nbe candid and credible. The delinquent debt in SOR \u00b6 1.c occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur. There are clear indications his financial problems \nare under control. His overall handling his finances does not cast doubt on his current \n9 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment. Financial considerations security concerns \nare mitigated. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is 31 years old, and he has been a field service engineer for a DOD \ncontractor since March of 2020. He served in Iraq, Afghanistan, Jordan, Kuwait, and \nDubai. In 2013, he was awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree. He has about 12 credit hours of \npost graduate education. He was awarded three professional certifications. He served in \nthe Air Force from 2008 to 2014, and he received an honorable discharge. He married in \n2016, and he was divorced in 2017. His former spouse has custody of their five-year-old \nson, and he is current on his child support. He pays about $1,500 monthly to support his \nson. \nApplicant\u2019s manager wrote that Applicant is an outstanding employee. He \nmastered an extremely complex system. He is one of the contractor\u2019s \u201cmost dependable \nemployees,\u201d a team player, and a \u201ctremendous asset.\u201d (AE O) \nApplicant acted responsibly under the circumstances, when he resolved all of his \ndelinquent SOR debts. He understands that he needs to pay his debts, keep his accounts \nin current status, and the conduct required to retain his security clearance. \nThe Appeal Board has addressed a key element in the whole-person analysis in \nfinancial cases stating: \n. . . the concept of meaningful track record necessarily includes evidence of \nactual debt reduction through payment of debts. However, an applicant is \n10 \n\n \n \n                                         \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________ \nnot required, as a matter of law, to establish that he has paid off each and \nevery debt listed in the SOR. All that is required is that an applicant \ndemonstrate that he has . . . established a plan to resolve his financial \nproblems and taken significant actions to implement that plan. The Judge \ncan reasonably consider the entirety of an applicant\u2019s financial situation and \nhis actions in evaluating the extent to which that applicant\u2019s plan for the \nreduction of his outstanding indebtedness is credible and realistic. See \nDirective \u00b6 E2.2(a) (Available, reliable information about the person, past \nand present, favorable and unfavorable, should be considered in reaching \na determination.) There is no requirement that a plan provide for payments \non all outstanding debts simultaneously. Rather, a reasonable plan (and \nconcomitant conduct) may provide for the payment of such debts one at a \ntime. Likewise, there is no requirement that the first debts actually paid in \nfurtherance of a reasonable debt plan be the ones listed in the SOR. \nISCR Case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) (internal citations and quotation \nmarks omitted). Applicant understands what he needs to do to establish and maintain his \nfinancial responsibility. His efforts at debt resolution have established a \u201cmeaningful track \nrecord\u201d of debt re-payment. I am confident he will maintain his financial responsibility. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, \nExec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the \nfacts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Applicant mitigated financial \nconsiderations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.k:  \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access \nto classified information.

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988), \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a \nsecurity clearance.\u201d As Commander in Chief, \u201cthe President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information may only be granted \u201cupon a finding that it is clearly \nconsistent with the national interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865, Safeguarding Classified \nInformation within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended.  \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe AGs list guidelines to be considered by judges in the decision-making process \ncovering DOHA cases. These guidelines take into account factors that could create a \npotential conflict of interest for the individual applicant, as well as considerations that \ncould affect the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to protect classified \ninformation. These guidelines include conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying (disqualifying conditions), if any, and all of the conditions that could \nmitigate security concerns, if any. \nThese guidelines must be considered before deciding whether or not a security \nclearance should be granted, continued, or denied. Although, the guidelines do not \nrequire judges to place exclusive reliance on the enumerated disqualifying and mitigating \nconditions in the guidelines in arriving at a decision. \n4 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nIn addition to the relevant AGs, judges must take into account the pertinent \nconsiderations for assessing extenuation and mitigation set forth in \u00b6 2(a) of the AGs, \nwhich are intended to assist the judges in reaching a fair and impartial, commonsense \ndecision based on a careful consideration of the pertinent guidelines within the context of \nthe whole person. The adjudicative process is designed to examine a sufficient period of \nan applicant\u2019s life to enable predictive judgments to be made about whether the applicant \nis an acceptable security risk. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s conduct, the relevant guidelines are to be \nconsidered together with the following \u00b6 2(d) factors: (1) the nature, extent, and \nseriousness of the conduct; (2) the circumstances surrounding the conduct, to include \nknowledgeable participation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and other \npermanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation of the conduct; (8) the potential for \npressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or \nrecurrence. \nViewing the issues raised and evidence as a whole, the following individual \nguidelines are pertinent herein: \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Concern:  Failure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts \nand meet financial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of \njudgment, or unwillingness to abide by rules or regulations, all of which can \nraise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability \nto protect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated  by, and thus can be a possible indicator of other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal acts or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds.  .  .  \n.  AG \u00b6 18.   \nBurdens of Proof \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nSee also Exec. Or. 12968 (Aug. 2, 1995), \u00a7 3.1. \n5 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n     \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531.  \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d  See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th  Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996).  \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15.

Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b).   \nAnalysis \nSecurity concerns are raised over Applicant\u2019s accumulation of delinquent student \nloan and consumer debts. Applicant\u2019s history of financial difficulties warrant the \napplication of two of the disqualifying conditions (DC) of the financial consideration \nguidelines: DC \u00b6\u00b6 19(a), \u201cinability to satisfy debts,\u201d and 19(c), \u201ca history of not meeting \nfinancial obligations.\u201d Each of these DCs apply to Applicant\u2019s situation. \nFinancial stability in a person cleared to protect classified information is required \nprecisely to inspire trust and confidence in the holder of a security clearance that entitles \nthe person to access classified information. While the principal concern of a security \nclearance holder\u2019s demonstrated difficulties is vulnerability to coercion and influence, \njudgment, and trust concerns are implicit in cases involving debt delinquencies.  \nHistorically, the timing of addressing and resolving tax filing failures and debt \ndelinquencies are critical to an assessment of an applicant\u2019s trustworthiness, reliability, \nand good judgment in following rules and guidelines necessary for those seeking access \nto classified information or to holding a sensitive position. See ISCR Case No. 14-06808 \nat 3 (App. Bd. Nov. 23. 2016); ISCR Case No. 14-01894 at 5 (App. Bd. Aug. 18, 2015). \nApplicant\u2019s accumulation of student loan and consumer debts over a period of years raise \ninitial security concerns over the stability of his finances. \nSince 2019, Applicant has made considerable progress in resolving his financial \ndelinquencies with documented payoffs and payment plans. His concerted initiatives \nenable him to take advantage of three mitigating conditions (MCs). MC \u00b6\u00b6 20(a) \u201cthe \nbehavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred under such \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment\u201d; 20(b), \u201cthe conditions that resulted in the \n6 \n\n \n \n                                                                                                                                              \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n                \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \nfinancial problem were largely beyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a \nbusiness downturn, unexpected medial emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the individual acted \nresponsibly under the circumstances\u201d; and 20(d), \u201cthe individual initiated and is adhering \nto a good-faith effort to repay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts\u201d apply to \nApplicant\u2019s situation. \nIn evaluating Guideline F cases, the Appeal Board has stressed the importance of \na \u201cmeaningful track record\u201d that includes evidence of actual debt reduction through the \nvoluntary payment of debts, and implicitly where applicable the timely resolution of such \ndebts. ISCR case No. 07-06482 at 2-3 (App. Bd. May 21, 2008) In Applicant\u2019s case, he \nhas exercised significant responsibility in addressing his debts when his spousal \ncircumstances improved and provided documented evidence addressing his delinquent \ndebts in issue. \nWhole-person assessment \nWhole-person \nassessment \nof \nApplicant\u2019s \nclearance \neligibility \nrequires \nconsideration of whether his finances are fully compatible with minimum standards for \nholding a clearance. In Applicant\u2019s case, he has provided strong evidence of his \naddressing his delinquent student loan and consumer debts. \nFurther, Applicant has provided important documented accounts of the high regard \nhis supervisors, colleagues, and friends have for him with respect to his judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness. His performance evaluations reflect strong contributions \nto his employer specifically and to the U.S. defense industry generally. Overall, \nApplicant\u2019s efforts in addressing his finances and satisfying the requirements of good \njudgment, reliability, and trustworthiness in his professional and personal life enable him \nto meet the minimum requirements for holding a security clearance. \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Department of Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518 (1988), Exec. Or. 10865, the Directive, and the AGs, to the facts and circumstances in \nthe context of the whole person.

In June 2018, Applicant began making student loan \nrehabilitation payments through an agreement with a creditor who took over the loans \nfrom the Department of Education. Initially, she was advised that the rehabilitation plan \nwould resolve all of her past-due loans through a single consolidation loan at a monthly \npayment rate of $199, and she established that those loans are now in good standing. \nHowever, the rehabilitation plan information she provided in support of her SOR response \nreflected a consolidation loan for about $16,439, far less than the $48,761 documented \nby the Government\u2019s information. After she reviewed the Government\u2019s information, \nApplicant made further inquiries and learned that a separate creditor owned the remaining \nstudent loan debt.

(FORM, Item 2; FORM at page 2) \nAvailable information also shows that Applicant started working with a financial \ncounselor in October 2018 to resolve discrepancies in her credit history, and to improve \nher personal financial management while repaying her past-due debts. As a result, in \naddition to the aforementioned student loan repayment plan in 2018 and the resolution of \nthe collection account at SOR 1.f, Applicant successfully disputed the cable television \ndebt alleged at SOR 1.d. Further, in March 2020 she paid the delinquent medical bill \nalleged at SOR 1.e, albeit after receiving the February 2020 SOR. That medical debt \narose from treatment Applicant has received for what appears to be recurring medical \nproblems since 2014. She averred that this debt became delinquent when she \ninadvertently failed to pay a bill in 2019 while on short-term disability. Available \ndocumentation supports this claim. (FORM, Items 2, 7 and 8; FORM Response) \nPolicies \nEligibility for a position of public trust must be based on a determination that it is \n\u201cclearly consistent with the interests of national security\u201d to do grant such access. Each \ndecision must be a fair, impartial, and commonsense determination based on examination \nof all available relevant and material information, and consideration of the pertinent \ncriteria and adjudication policy in the adjudicative guidelines. (See Directive, 6.3) \nDecisions must also reflect consideration of the factors listed in \u00b6 2(d) of the guidelines. \nCommonly referred to as the \u201cwhole-person\u201d concept, those factors are: \n(1) The nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual's age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n \nThe Government bears the initial burden of producing admissible information on \nwhich it based the preliminary decision to deny or revoke an applicant\u2019s eligibility. \nAdditionally, the Government must be able to prove controverted facts alleged in the \nSOR. If the Government meets its burden, it then falls to the applicant to refute, extenuate \nor mitigate the Government\u2019s case. Because no one has a \u201cright\u201d to a position of public \ntrust, an applicant bears a heavy burden of persuasion. (See Egan, 484 U.S. at 528, 531) \nA person who has access to sensitive or protected information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government \nhas a compelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability and trustworthiness of one who will protect the national interests as his or her \nown. The \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nunresolved doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for eligibility in favor of the Government. \n(See Egan; AG \u00b6 2(b)) \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe presence or absence of a disqualifying or mitigating condition is not \ndeterminative of a conclusion for or against an applicant. However, specific applicable \nguidelines should be followed whenever a case can be measured against them as they \nrepresent policy guidance governing the grant or denial of access to classified \ninformation. This decision is intended only to resolve whether it is clearly consistent with \nthe national interest for an applicant to either receive or continue to have access to \nsensitive information. (Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518 (1988)) \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nThe Government\u2019s information supports the SOR allegations that Appellant \naccrued more than $52,000 in delinquent or past-due debt, most of which is comprised \nof delinquent student loans. As recently as August 2020, the majority of her student loans \nhad not been addressed. These facts reasonably raised some of the trustworthiness \nconcerns stated, in relevant part, at AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nMore specifically, available information requires application of the following AG \u00b6 \n19 disqualifying conditions: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nI also considered the following AG \u00b6 20 mitigating conditions: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nAG \u00b6 20(a) applies only in part. It does not appear that Applicant has actually \nincurred any new debt since 2017; however, she still has significant debt yet to be \nresolved. Accordingly, her financial problems must be viewed as recent. Nonetheless, \nthey arose from circumstances \u2013 unemployment, illness, and elder-care obligations \u2013 that \nwere not of her own making. Her financial problems are not a product of poor judgment \nor lack of trustworthiness. \nThere has been no misconduct here and AG \u00b6 20(b) applies because of the \ncircumstances that contributed to Applicant\u2019s inability to meet all of her debt repayment \nobligations. Additionally, the record shows that Applicant acted reasonably under the \ncircumstances. In 2018, two months before she was interviewed by an investigator during \nthis background investigation, and well before the SOR was issued, Applicant engaged \nthe services of a financial counselor to help her resolve her past-due debts. Even before \nthen, when she was still unemployed in 2017, Applicant began participation in a student \nloan rehabilitation program. As to the loans that were not included in that program, it \nappears reasonable under the circumstances that she thought everything had been \naddressed and that all of her loans had been brought current. Her action to address the \nremaining debts through student loan rehabilitation in response to the FORM, in this \ninstance, indicates good judgment on her part. Likewise, she provided a plausible \nexplanation for why she did not resolve SOR 1.e until recently. The record evidence as a \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nwhole shows that Applicant was proactive in trying to resolve her financial problems well \nbefore this investigation, and even before she began her current employment. She acted \nreasonably under the circumstances with which she was presented. This same \ninformation also supports full application of AG \u00b6 20(d). \nFinally, Applicant engaged a financial counselor with positive results. This has \nhelped to resolve her debts in an organized and effective manner, and to organize her \npersonal finances so as to avoid future shortfalls. AG \u00b6 20(c) applies. \nFinancial problems present a two-fold inquiry. First, does the ongoing presence of \nunpaid debt or other unresolved financial burdens present a likelihood that Applicant \nwould resort to illegal acts or other conduct that might compromise national interests? \nHere, that appears highly unlikely as there is no indication anywhere in this record to \nsuggest Applicant has engaged in any misconduct, financial or otherwise. Additionally, \nthe manner in which she has responded to her financial problems is indicative of a \nwillingness to resolve her debts and further manage her finances responsibly. \nSecond, did Applicant\u2019s financial problems arise from irresponsible decisions, poor \njudgment, or other factors that indicate she is unreliable or untrustworthy? I conclude they \ndid not. Instead, a combination of illness and family obligations caused interruptions in \nher ability to earn enough money to meet her debt payment obligations. The record as a \nwhole establishes that those circumstances have changed for the better, that Applicant \nhas demonstrated sound judgment in acting to resolve her debts, and that she is now \nbetter equipped to manage her finances. On balance, Appellant has presented sufficient \ninformation to mitigate the trustworthiness concerns about her finances. \nIn addition to my evaluation of the facts and application of the appropriate \nadjudicative factors under Guideline F, I have reviewed the record before me in the \ncontext of the whole-person factors listed in AG \u00b6 2(d). Applicant\u2019s responses to her \nfinancial problems began before the SOR was issued and reflect a mature, responsible \napproach to resolving her debts. A fair and commonsense assessment of the record \nevidence as a whole shows that Applicant has mitigated the trustworthiness concerns \nabout her financial problems. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as required by section \nE3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.f: \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraphs 1.g \u2013 1.i: \nFor Applicant \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \nConclusion \nIn light of all available information, it is clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security for Applicant to have access to sensitive information. Applicant\u2019s request \nfor eligibility for a public trust position is granted. \nMATTHEW E. MALONE \nAdministrative Judge \n7 \n",

Applicant submitted \nfive documents marked AX A-E, without objection and admitted into the record. At \nApplicant\u2019s request, the record was held open until November 26, 2020. The Applicant \nsubmitted one document as clarification and the Government submitted one document. \nThe exhibits (GX 4) and (AX F) were entered into the record without objection from \neither side. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 27 years old.

Applicant completed her \nlatest security clearance application (SCA) on February 4, 2019. (GX 3) \nThe SOR alleges under Guideline H that Applicant used marijuana, with varying \nfrequency, from about October 2011 until about April 2018 (1.a); that she used \nmarijuana while granted access to classified information (1.b) and that she intends to \nuse marijuana in the future (1.c). The SOR alleges under Guideline E that Applicant \nfalsified her November 20, 2017 SCA when she answered \u201cNo\u201d to Section 23: which \nasks whether she possessed or used illegal drugs in the previous seven years (2.a). \nApplicant admitted the allegations under 1.a and 1.b, and she denied 1.c and 2.a. \nApplicant testified that she participated in the professional development program \nand rotated positions in the company that she is currently employed with for about four \nyears. (Tr.15) She elaborated that she had a \u201creally good understanding of the defense \nindustry and expand[ed] her knowledge.\u201d (Tr. 15) She explained that she is a natural \nleader and has been a good example for women.\u201d (Tr. 17) Applicant admitted that she \ntook initial training for security, but she could not recall training on how to complete a \nsecurity clearance application. (Tr. 18) It was when she received the SOR that she \nrealized that she had \u201ctriggered\u201d the security concerns under Guidelines H and E. She \nacknowledged she received counseling from her attorney. \nApplicant began smoking marijuana in 2011 when she was in college. (GX 3) \nShe admitted this in her subject interview and stated that she used it to calm her \nanxiety. The usage was approximately twice a week. She admitted that she used the \nmarijuana in California because it was legal in that state. (GX 3) When she came to \nMaryland, she knew it was illegal under Maryland law, and she stopped using marijuana \nin April 2018. In her March 2019, subject interview Applicant stated that she did use \nmarijuana while holding her security clearance in 2017.

(Tr. 27) She stated if it became federally legalized, she would continue to \nuse marijuana.  In 2019, she had never sought treatment for anxiety. \nAt the hearing Applicant presented a multitude of reasons why she used \nmarijuana, which did not conform to her answers in her 2019 subject interview. After \nreceiving the SOR and seeking advice of counsel, she explained that the use of \nmarijuana was due to her high levels of anxiety, family background, financial issues, \nand stressful relationship. (AX C). She stopped associating with people who use \nmarijuana, obtained an evaluation, and signed an intent not to use marijuana in the \nfuture. (Tr. 23) She also stated that she is extremely sorry. (Tr. 25) At one point, she \nstated that she did not understand the difference between federal and state law despite \nher security training. \nIn October 2020, Applicant obtained an evaluation from a psychologist who \nconcluded Applicant did not appear to be in acute emotional distress. (AX E) She \nadmitted to episodic bouts of anxiety or depression. In that report it was recommended \nthat she establish and maintain outpatient treatment for psychiatry and psychiatric \ntreatment since her relocation to Maryland. (AX E) The psychologist noted that \nApplicant has an inclination toward adventuresome behavior and risk taking which might \nsuggest a higher propensity to alcohol and drug abuse when compared to sample \nnorms. (AX E) \nApplicant completed a SCA in November 2017. (GX 2) She did not disclose her \nuse of illegal drugs and answered \u201cNo\u201d to Section 23, which asked whether she \npossessed or used illegal drugs in the last seven years. In her answer, she denied the \nallegation stating that there were many parts to the application, and it took her a long \ntime to complete it. She stated that she asked her peer and no one mentioned that she \nshould list the marijuana use. (Tr. 29) She stated at the hearing that she answered, no, \nto illegal drug use but she knew she had used marijuana and countered that by saying \nshe did not read the question thoroughly. (Tr. 30) Applicant also blamed it on her belief \nthat using marijuana in California was not illegal because marijuana use was legal \nunder California state law. She stated that from a federal perspective she did not \nunderstand that marijuana was illegal. This is hard to find credible given her work in the \ndefense field and her program training. (Tr. 32-33) \nApplicant changed her answer in her February 4, 2019 SCA, with respect to drug \nuse in the past seven years. She said she spoke to some people, but did not think to \ncheck with her facility security officer (FSO) for advice. (Tr. 35-36) She elaborated that \nshe answered she would use marijuana in the future, but that was before she engaged \na psychologist or attorney. (Tr. 37) She also stated that she was confused when she \nreceived her security clearance. \nThe Government, in a post-hearing submission presented proof that Applicant \nreceived her security clearance on December 12, 2017. Applicant was adamant that \nshe would no longer use marijuana but stated that the fear of losing her security \nclearance really made her stop smoking marijuana. (Tr. 49) The Applicant submitted a \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \nclarification stating that some peers told her not to report the marijuana use on the \nsecond application, and she was confused. (AX F) She did not provide the names of the \npeers that gave her this advice. \nApplicant submitted eight declarations concerning her good character and each \nattested to her reliability, trustworthiness, and ability. (GX D) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a \nconscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d \nThe administrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the \nperson, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to \nclassified information will be resolved in favor of national security.\u201d In reaching this \ndecision, I have drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based \non the evidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of \ntrust and confidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions \ninclude, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the \nnational interest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline H, Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for this guideline is set forth in AG \u00b6 24, where it is noted \nthat the illegal use of a controlled substance, and the use of other substances that can \ncause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their \nintended purpose, can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and \ntrustworthiness. This is because such behavior may lead to physical or psychological \nimpairment and because it raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to \ncomply with laws, rules, and regulations. Such use also raised questions about a \nperson\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, and regulations. \nHere, Applicant admitted she used marijuana with varying frequency from \nOctober 2011 until April 2018. She admitted that she had a security clearance since \n2017. This is sufficient to raise AG \u00b6 25(a): any substance misuse, and \u00b6 25(f): any \nillegal use while granted access to classified information or holding a sensitive position. \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence, as provided by Applicant\u2019s admissions, thus \nraises security concerns under Guideline H. Therefore, the burden shifts to Applicant to \nproduce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate related security concerns. \nUnder Guideline H, conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \ndrug involvement and substance misuse are enumerated. The following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 26 potentially apply to Applicant\u2019s case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \nand  \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions to overcome this problem, \nand has established a pattern of abstinence, including but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing \nor avoiding the environment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a \nsigned statement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or misuse \nis grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.   \nApplicant\u2019s last possession and use of marijuana, an illegal substance to possess \nunder federal law, took place in April 2018. She acknowledged using marijuana with \nvarying frequency during the period from 2001 through 2018. In terms of age, \nmaturation, and work history, sufficient time has not passed to deem her marijuana \nusage as remote. She provided a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. I find drug involvement \nand substance misuse security concerns are not mitigated. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities, and \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole \nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the person may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nHere, Applicant intentionally answered \u201cNo\u201d on her November 20, 2017 (SCA) in \nresponse to a question inquiring whether she had illegally possessed or used any \ncontrolled substance, for example marijuana, in the last seven years. (Section 23) She \nresponded \u201cYes\u201d on her February 4, 2019 SCA. Her reasoning was not credible in that \nshe changed her answer due to confusion and after speaking to peers. The question is \nclear and not confusing. \nAG \u00b6 17 describes conditions that could mitigate security concerns. Potentially \napplicable in this matter is AG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has \npassed, or the behavior is so infrequent or it happened under such unique \ncircumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \nreliability, untrustworthiness, or good judgment. \nHere, Applicant exhibited two instances of unreliable conduct reflecting \nquestionable judgment. These include the few instances she used marijuana between \n2011 and 2018. She held a security clearance in 2017. Her failure to disclose on her \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n        \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nfirst SCA that she had used marijuana was intentional. The responses that she provided \nwere not reasonable or credible and varied each time she responded. She gave various \nreasons why she answered \u201cNo\u201d to Section 14. She later provided information on the \nsecond SCA. However, I do not find her testimony credible or reliable. I do not find her \nclaims of confusion to be plausible, given the plain language of the question on the \nSCAs. I find none of the mitigating conditions apply in this case. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, one must evaluate security clearance eligibility \nby considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. \nConsideration shall be given to the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d). \nThe final determination must be an overall commonsense judgment based on careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and conducted a whole-person \nanalysis based on the record. In addition to Applicant\u2019s past drug involvement and \npersonal conduct. She was not credible in her testimony concerning her knowledge of \nthe defense industry and her confusion about so many things. After the SOR, she \nsought an evaluation and counseling. The report stated that she does have a slightly \nhigher inclination for further drug abuse. She is however, on the right track, if she \nreceives treatment. She admitted that she was scared of losing her security clearance. \nShe signed a declaration of intent and went to a psychologist. \nApplicant seemed very casual about her marijuana use and the reason for the \nsecurity clearance. She stated that she did not know the difference between federal and \nstate law pertaining to marijuana possession and use despite receiving security training. \nI find Applicant did not persuade me that despite her many excuses she has mitigated \nher case under both guidelines. She used marijuana while holding a clearance. After the \nfact, she has obtained counseling and vows not to use marijuana in the future, but I find \nthese belated actions to be of insufficient weight given the whole picture of the case. \nApplicant intentionally falsified an SCA regarding her possession and use of \nmarijuana. The reasons she gave are not plausible. I have doubts as to Applicant\u2019s \ntrustworthiness, judgment, and reliability. Any doubts must be resolved in favor of the \nGovernment. Under these circumstances, I find Applicant has not mitigated drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, and personal conduct security concerns due to \nintentional falsification of her 2017 SCA. Clearance is denied. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.c: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nAGAINST applicant \nSubparagraph 2.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nNoreen A.

She enjoys her work and excels in performing her duties. Applicant was \nraised in an area where she was surrounded by military and U.S. Department of Defense \n(DOD) personnel her entire life. (FORM, Item 2 at 2) She has earned a bachelor\u2019s and \nmaster\u2019s degree. Applicant lives with a cohabitant. She has no children. \nIn September 2008 on a Questionnaire for National Security Positions (QNSP), \nApplicant disclosed that she had used marijuana from June 2007 until April 2008. \nSubsequently, in about January 2009, she was granted access to classified information. \nOver the years, Applicant received annual briefings and other security training reminders \nof the requirements for maintaining a security clearance, including emails in November \n2012 and January 2015, advising all employees that marijuana remained federally illegal, \ndespite some non-federal jurisdictions decriminalizing the drug. Applicant recently \nclaimed she quit using marijuana between the time she was granted such access in 2009 \nuntil marijuana was legalized in her state, about four years or less later. Her marijuana \nabuse then continued despite federal law and her possession of a federally-granted \nsecurity clearance. (FORM, Item 2 at 1) \nIn her December 2014 QNSP, Applicant disclosed that she used marijuana from \nJanuary 2009 through November 2018. In so doing, she noted that marijuana was legal \nwhere she was located. (FORM, Item 3) She also disclosed that she intended to use \nmarijuana again in the future. Learning of her federally illegal drug use, the Facility \nSecurity Officer (FSO) filed an incident report detailing these facts. The FSO noted that \nprior to her QNSP submission, this information had not been previously reported. \nIn May 2019, Applicant was interviewed by investigators. She confirmed she had \nused marijuana as recently as March 2019. Indeed, she stated that she used the federally \nillegal substance about every other month, and intended to continue to do so in the future. \nShortly after the interview, Applicant altered her earlier stance, stating that continued \nmarijuana use was \u201cfairly likely\u201d and \u201cnot out of the question,\u201d and noting that she \u201cfully \nunderstands the significance and gravity of the position of trust the United States would \nplace on me by granting a security clearance, and pledge to abide by federal law and \nDOD regulations.\u201d (FORM, Item 7) \nIn the SOR, it was alleged that Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency \nfrom about June 2007 and at least March 2019, an allegation she admitted. She also \nadmitted that this marijuana use took place despite her having been granted access to \nclassified information in January 2009. These admitted facts were the basis for security \nconcerns under the guidelines for drug involvement and for personal conduct. \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant minimalized her past marijuana use, \ncharacterizing it as \u201can \u2018anomaly,\u2019\u201d \u201cinfrequent,\u201d and \u201cirregular.\u201d (FORM, Item 2 at 1) She \nstated that she now fully appreciates the significance and the gravity of the Government\u2019s \nprohibition of illegal drug use by those granted a security clearance. She vowed in that \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nApril 2020 SOR response that it is now her intent to abstain from all illegal use of \nsubstances and acknowledged \u201cthat any future involvement or misuse is grounds for \nrevocation of my national security eligibility.\u201d (FORM, Item 2 at 1) She explained that \nbecause she considered her marijuana use to be as minimal as her handling of secure \ndocuments, she \u201cfailed to recall the requirement to report\u201d her marijuana use despite her \ncompany\u2019s annual security briefings. (FORM, Item 2 at 3) \nAs an employee, Applicant excels in her work. Over the past five years, her annual \nperformance appraisals have been positive, describing her as hard working and \ndedicated. (FORM, Item 2 at 4) In 2019, her strengths were described as: \u201cReliable, \nefficient, and organized; Self-starting; Confident in technical abilities/knowledge; Thinks \noutside the box and finds ways to get things done. . . . [She] is an asset to the [ -- ] team, \nand her peers look up to her in every aspect of the job.\u201d (FORM, Item 2 at 4) She does \nnot believe her federally illegal marijuana use defines her as a person. (Response to the \nFORM) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Recognizing the complexities of \nhuman behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the factors listed in the \nadjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, \nimpartial, and commonsense decision. The entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of \na number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge \nmust consider all available, reliable information about the person, past and present, \nfavorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. Under the \nAG, any doubt concerning personnel being considered for access to classified information \nwill be resolved in favor of the national interest. In reaching this decision, I have drawn \nonly those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence contained \nin the record. \nThe Government must present evidence to establish controverted facts alleged in \nthe SOR. Under the Directive, an \u201capplicant is responsible for presenting witnesses and \nother evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate facts admitted by applicant or \nproven by Department Counsel and has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a \nfavorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ntranscends normal duty hours. The Government reposes a high degree of trust and \nconfidence in those granted access to classified information. Decisions include, by \nnecessity, consideration of the possible risk the applicant may deliberately or \ninadvertently fail to safeguard such information. Decisions shall be in terms of the national \ninterest and do not question the loyalty of an applicant. \nAnalysis \nGUIDELINE H \u2013 Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nThe security concern for this guideline is set forth in AG \u00b6 24, where it is noted that \nthe illegal use of a controlled substance, and the use of other substances that can cause \nphysical or mental impairment or are used in a manner inconsistent with their intended \npurpose, can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness. Such \nuse also raises questions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Here, Applicant used marijuana with varying frequency from about June \n2007 to at least March 2019. This use of federally illegal marijuana continued despite her \nhaving been granted access to classified information in January 2009. These facts \npotentially raise AG \u00b6 25: \n(a) any substance misuse . . , and  \n(f) any illegal drug use while granted access to classified information or \nholding a sensitive position.  \nThe Government\u2019s substantial evidence, as confirmed by Applicant\u2019s admissions, raises \nthe security concerns noted under this guideline. Therefore, the burden shifts to Applicant \nto produce evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate related security concerns. \nUnder Guideline H, conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising from \ndrug involvement and substance misuse are enumerated. The following mitigating \nconditions under AG \u00b6 26 potentially apply to Applicant\u2019s case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \nhappened under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or \ndoes not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s current reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment;   \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to \novercome this problem, and has established a pattern of \nabstinence, including but not limited to: (1) disassociation from \ndrug-using associates and contacts; (2) changing or avoiding the \nenvironment where drugs were used; and (3) providing a signed \nstatement of intent to abstain from all drug involvement and \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsubstance misuse, acknowledging that any future involvement or \nmisuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility.   \nApplicant regularly used marijuana for nearly a dozen years. Based on the most \nrecent information, she has abstained from marijuana, a federally illegal drug, for two \nyears. Her last period of abstinence starting in early 2009, however, lasted no more than \nfour years before she resumed her marijuana use. Moreover, she has been inconsistent \nwith regard to her intentions as to her future use of marijuana. These facts undermine \napplication of AG \u00b6 26(a). \nIn her response to the SOR, Applicant provided a signed statement of intent to \nabstain from all drug involvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security eligibility. This \nexpression effectively raises AG \u00b6 26(b)(3). \nOtherwise, Applicant provides scant information regarding any recent changes she \nhas made in her life to overcome her marijuana use or resist temptation in an area where \nmarijuana has been decriminalized. Such insight could help raise other portions of AG \u00b6 \n26(b). Moreover, despite her excellent performance appraisals and expressed intent to \nnot use marijuana in the future, we are left with an Applicant who was raised within the \nmilitary and DOD communities; attended a number of training sessions emphasizing the \nneed to refrain from illegal drugs in order to successfully maintain a federal security \nclearance; and received emails reinforcing that non-federal legal changes regarding \nmarijuana did not relieve one of their federal obligations in terms of a federal security \nclearance. That she \u201cfailed to recall\u201d her obligation to report such marijuana use to her \nFSO -- because she used the drug infrequently and rarely handled classified documents \n-- stretches credulity. No other mitigating conditions apply. \nGUIDELINE E \u2013 Personal Conduct \nThe security concern for personal conduct is set out in AG \u00b6 15: Conduct involving \nquestionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or unwillingness to comply with rules \nand regulations can raise questions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and \nability to protect classified or sensitive information. The following will normally result in an \nunfavorable national security eligibility determination, security clearance action, or \ncancellation of further processing from national security eligibility: \n(b) refusal to provide full, frank, and truthful answers to lawful questions of \ninvestigators, security officials, or other official representatives in \nconnection with a personnel security or trustworthiness determination.    \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying. The following disqualifying conditions are potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or similar \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nform used to conduct investigations, determine employment qualifications, \naward benefits or status, determine national security eligibility or \ntrustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities;  \n(b) deliberately providing false or misleading information; or concealing or \nomitting information, concerning relevant facts to an employer, investigator, \nsecurity official, competent medical or mental health professional involved \nin making a recommendation relevant to a national security eligibility \ndetermination, or other official government representative, and \n(e): personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, or duress by a foreign intelligence \nentity or other individual or group. Such conduct includes: (1) engaging in \nactivities which, if known, could affect the person\u2019s personal, professional, \nor community standing. . . .  \nApplicant obfuscated relevant facts concerning her marijuana use to investigators \nand security personnel during both the process for determining national security eligibility \nand in the execution of daily work performance. Applicant and those within her work \ncommunity certainly knew marijuana was federally illegal and its use was inconsistent \nwith the maintenance of a federally-granted security clearance. As witnessed by the \nreaction of her FSO, knowledge of her drug use could and did affect her standing within \nher field. I find AG \u00b6 16(a), AG \u00b6 16(b), and AG \u00b6 16(e) apply. \nI also have considered these facts in light of the AG \u00b6 17 mitigating conditions. I \nfind the following potentially applicable: \nAG \u00b6 17(c): the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the \nbehavior is so infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances \nthat it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s \nreliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; and \nAG \u00b6 17(e): the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress.  \nHere, AG \u00b6 17(c) does not apply for the same reasons AG \u00b6 26(a) was found \ninapplicable. Moreover, the scant information provided by Applicant in her written answers \nfails to show what positive steps she has taken to reduce any temptation she might \nencounter living in a region where marijuana is readily available and where she might \nbecome vulnerable to social pressures. This would be particularly helpful given her past \nknowledge that marijuana was federally illegal and her active efforts to minimize her past \ndrug use. Therefore, AG \u00b6 17(e) does not apply. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, one must evaluate security clearance eligibility \nby considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s conduct and all relevant circumstances. \nConsideration shall be given to the nine adjudicative process factors listed in the AG. The \nfinal determination must be an overall commonsense judgment based on careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case, and conducted a whole-person analysis \nbased on the record. In addition to Applicant\u2019s drug use, I considered available facts \nrelated to her age, reasons for using illegal drugs or illegally using prescription \nmedications, maturation, professional status, educational attainments, lifestyle, and \nfuture intentions regarding illegal substances. \nApplicant was put on notice of the security concerns related to marijuana during \nher initial investigation in 2008. She was granted a security clearance in 2009. At that \ntime, she quit using the drug. By email and through training, she was advised that federal, \nnot state or local, law was controlling with regard to marijuana and the maintenance of a \nsecurity clearance. She resumed her marijuana use, however, when marijuana was \ndecriminalized in her area. She continued that drug use through at least March 2019, \nafter completing her 2019 QNSP. \nOver the years, Applicant\u2019s claims and reasoning behind her drug use have \nevolved. For example, at one point she expressed her intent to continue to use marijuana, \nthen later reported that it was \u201cfairly likely\u201d she would continue to use marijuana. More \nrecently, she conveyed that it is her intent to abstain from all illegal drugs going forward. \nWith regard to her most recent two-year period of abstention, it can only be given \ndiminished weight in light of the fact her previous period of abstinence lasted only until \nher state jurisdiction decriminalized marijuana, a period of no more than four years. When \nan applicant\u2019s past shows evidence of a lack of self-discipline, unreliability, or \nuntrustworthiness, questions arise. Specifically, they arise as to whether an applicant can \ntruly be relied upon and trusted to exercise the responsibility necessary for working in an \nenvironment where they have access to sensitive information. This is true regardless of \nhow much classified information an applicant might actually handle. \nThe greatest concern in this case is Applicant\u2019s choice to continue using marijuana \nafter being granted access to classified information. This is a clear breach of the trust and \nconfidence placed in the Applicant when the Government granted her access to classified \ninformation. In continuing to use, then refrain from, marijuana for a second time, it is \ndifficult to gauge the significance of this current period of abstinence. It would not seem \ninappropriate to expect Applicant to at least refrain from marijuana for a commensurate \nperiod of time as her last period of abstinence, and provide some insight into how she is \nresisting temptation to return to marijuana use while living in a region that has \ndecriminalized the drug. In light of the foregoing, I find Applicant failed to mitigate drug \ninvolvement and personal conduct security concerns. \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n     Conclusion \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 1, Guideline E: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 2.a-2.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant a security clearance. \nEligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nArthur E.

Gregorian, Esq., Department Counsel \nFor Applicant: Pro Se \n09/20/2021 \nDecision \nHEINTZELMAN, Caroline E., Administrative Judge: \nApplicant did not mitigate the drug involvement security concerns. Eligibility for \naccess to classified information is denied. \nHistory of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on June 19, 2019. On \nApril 22, 2020, the Department of Defense (DOD) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) \nalleging security concerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse). \nWhen Applicant initially answered the SOR, in approximately June 2020, he requested a \ndecision based upon the written record. On January 14, 2021, he requested a hearing \nbefore an administrative judge (Answer). The case was assigned to me on April 7, 2021. \nOn May 28, 2021, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant \nthat the hearing was scheduled for June 28, 2021. The hearing was held as scheduled, \nvia video teleconference on the Defense Collaboration Service (DCS). \nAt the hearing, Government Exhibits (GE) 1 and 2 were admitted without objection, \nand Applicant testified. I marked the May 27, 2021 case management order as Hearing \nExhibit (HE) I; Department Counsel\u2019s February 27, 2021 discovery letter as HE II; and \nDepartment Counsel\u2019s exhibit list as HE III. The record was held open until July 12, 2021, \nfor Applicant to submit documentation. I received the transcript (Tr.) on July 9, 2021.

AE A and B were admitted without objection. \nThe Government chose to rest on the closing statement made at the hearing, and the \nrecord closed. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant is 37 years old and married. He and his wife have a 10-year-old son and \na 4-year-old daughter. He received a Bachelor of Art degree in psychology in 2008 and \nan Associate degree in computer-aided drafting technology in 2018. Applicant has worked \nfor a defense contractor as a drafting and design associate since May 2019. This is his \nfirst security clearance application. (GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 9-11, 15-16) \nApplicant admitted all of the SOR allegations. He first used marijuana in 2004, \nduring the summer after his first year of college, and last used marijuana a few days \nbefore the hearing. He admitted in his answer to the SOR that he intended to continue to \nrecreationally use marijuana. At the hearing, he confirmed that he intends to continue to \nuse marijuana. (GE 1; GE 2; Tr. 16-17, 24-25, 27-28, 32-33) \nIn his June 2019 SCA, Applicant disclosed that he used marijuana from June 2012 \nto March 2019. He indicated that he intended to stop using marijuana as he did not \u201cwant \nto set a bad example for [his] children.\u201d (GE 1; Tr. 25) \nIn his adopted August 2019 security clearance interview, Applicant admitted that \nhe smoked marijuana almost daily while he was in college. His use gradually decreased \nas he aged. At the time of the interview, his most recent marijuana purchase was in \nFebruary 2019, and his most recent use was two weeks before the interview. At that time, \nhe still possessed marijuana at home and intended to use it. (GE 2; Tr. 25) \nApplicant used marijuana a few days before the hearing. He regularly uses \nmarijuana two to three days a week alone at home. Most of his social circle uses \nmarijuana. Occasionally, he uses marijuana with his friends; most recently, while playing \ngolf in May 2021. He typically purchases marijuana one to two times a year; most recently \nin October 2020. As of the day of the hearing, he possessed approximately one eighth of \nan ounce of marijuana at his home, which he intended to use. He intends to continue to \nuse marijuana regularly. (Tr. 16-18, 23-24, 27-32) \n \nIn his answer to the SOR and at the hearing, Applicant characterized his marijuana \nuse as responsible and the laws regarding marijuana as antiquated. He resides in a state \nin which recreational use continues to be illegal, but medical marijuana use is legal. \nApplicant did not proffer that his use of marijuana was for medicinal purposes, nor has he \never possessed a medical marijuana prescription. (Answer; Tr. 16-18, 23-24, 27-31, 33-\n34) \nApplicant described his 17-year history of recreational marijuana use, and he \nrationalized his continued use of marijuana as follows: \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nI\u2019ve stopped numerous times throughout my youth for months here and \nthere, for various reasons. But at that point I had stopped for the drug-test \nfor the hiring at [current employer]. . . . . I\u2019ve always gone back and forth \nabout using it or not, mostly because my wife\u2026doesn\u2019t love it either. So at \nthe time during that, the initial interrogatories, eQIP questionnaire, I strongly \nconsidered stopping entirely for that and for the security clearance and most \nother things. Like I said, I find that I\u2019m not as angry of a person, and like I \nsaid, I\u2019m just a better person and a better father when I do use it.  (Tr. 26) \nApplicant\u2019s current employer required him to take a pre-employment drug test, \nwhich he passed. According to its company policy, the employer is supposed to conduct \nrandom drug testing of its employees. However, Applicant has learned from other \nemployees that the company does not, in fact, conduct random drug screening or testing \nother than during the pre-employment phase. Applicant knows that it is against his \nemployer\u2019s company policy to use drugs, including marijuana, and is aware that his \nmarijuana use could adversely affect his employment and ability to obtain and maintain a \nsecurity clearance. Applicant has not disclosed his drug involvement to his security officer \nor anyone else at his current employer, because he is aware his marijuana use is not \npermitted. (GE 1; Tr. 17-20, 31-32) \n \nTwo of Applicant\u2019s prior employers also had drug-free workplace policies, and at \nleast one of these employers required him to take a pre-employment drug-screening \nurinalysis. He admitted that he used marijuana while working for both of these prior \nemployers. According to Applicant, if his employers had regularly drug tested him, he \nwould have stopped using marijuana. However, despite the criminality of recreational \nmarijuana use in his state and at the federal level and his employer\u2019s company policies, \nhe feels that \u201cthe benefits\u201d he gets \u201cfrom [using marijuana] are quite beneficial.\u201d (Tr. 20-\n24) \n  \n \nApplicant\u2019s friends and family members find him to be dependable, trustworthy, \nreliable, organized, efficient, and honest. In his written closing statement, he asserted that \nhe a responsible, trustworthy, and hardworking individual. He currently uses marijuana to \nreduce stress rather than to party. He values his job and the value it adds to protecting \nthe United States. (AE A; AE B) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines.

Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(c), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The applicant \nhas the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation of potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 expresses the security concern pertaining to drug involvement: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted \nin this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nApplicant\u2019s admissions and the record evidence establish the following \ndisqualifying conditions under AG \u00b6 25: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n(f) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, or \nfailure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nThe burden shifted to Appellant to prove mitigation of the resulting security \nconcerns. AG \u00b6 26 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nApplicant first started using marijuana in 2004, after his first year of college.

Off-duty \nconduct, especially where it reflects poor judgment, provides a rational basis for the \ngovernment to question an appellant\u2019s security worthiness. (See, e.g., Cole v. Young, 351 \nU.S. 536, 550 n.13 (1956); Croft v. Department of Air Force, 40 M.S.P.R. 320, 321 n.1 \n(1989)). Applicant\u2019s behavior showed a disregard for not only the drug polices of his \nemployers, but also federal and state law.  \nbasis. He used and purchased marijuana after he married, after he had children, after he \nstarted his career, after he worked for employers with drug policies, after he applied for a \nsecurity clearance, and after he was interviewed by a government investigator. He knew \nthat drug involvement violated the drug-use policies of his current and former employers.  \nApplicant\u2019s regular purchase and use of marijuana cannot be considered a minor lapse \nin judgment, but rather a pattern of behavior that reflects his unwillingness to follow rules \nand regulations. \nApplicant continues to associate with individuals who use marijuana, and he \ncontinues to purchase, possess, and use marijuana. His 17-year history of drug \ninvolvement raise significant concerns. He failed to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 26(a), \n26(b), and or 26(d). \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the potentially \ndisqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and circumstances \nsurrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under Guideline H in my whole-\nperson analysis. I considered that Applicant self-disclosed his drug involvement during \nthe security clearance process. I also considered the comments offered by Applicant in \nhis closing statement and the favorable opinions of his friends and family. However, there \nhas not been a sufficient passage of time to overcome the concerns with his drug \ninvolvement. Applicant has not met his burden of proof and persuasion. He did not \nmitigate the security concerns or establish his eligibility for a security clearance. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n__________________________ \nFormal Findings \nI make the following formal findings on the allegations in the SOR: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:   \n \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n \n \nSubparagraphs 1.a - 1.c:  \n \nAgainst Applicant \n \nConclusion \nI conclude that it is not clearly consistent with the interests of national security of \nthe United States to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s national security eligibility for access to \nclassified information.

He did not present sufficient evidence to explain, \nextenuate, or mitigate his history of financial problems. Accordingly, this case is decided \nagainst Applicant. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant completed and submitted a Standard Form (SF) 86, Questionnaire for \nNational Security Positions, the official form used for personnel security investigations, \non May 17, 2018. (Exhibit 4) This document is commonly known as a security clearance \napplication. He provided additional information when interviewed during a background \ninvestigation.

He provided a \nsupplemental answer to the SOR on March 3, 2021. His answers were mixed; he \nprovided explanatory remarks; and he provided supporting documentation. He \nrequested a decision based on the written record in lieu of a hearing. \nOn March 17, 2021, Department Counsel submitted a file of relevant material \n(FORM). It consists of Department Counsel\u2019s written brief and supporting \ndocumentation, some of which are identified as evidentiary exhibits herein. The FORM \nwas mailed to Applicant on March 26, 2021; he received it on April 6, 2021. He timely \nreplied to the FORM with a one-page memorandum and supporting documentation, \nwhich are admitted as Exhibit A.

He has a full-time job as a \nsecurity assistant. He has been so employed since May 2018. Before that, he had a full-\ntime job as a security site manager for about five years during 2013-2018.

(Exhibit 10 at 1-2) \nIn his security clearance application, Applicant reported two periods of \nunemployment in the last decade. (Exhibit 4 at Section 13A) He was unemployed from \nSeptember 2012 to March 2013, a period of about seven months. He was also \nunemployed for about two months from January 2012 to February 2012. \nThe SOR alleges a history of financial problems consisting of four delinquent \naccounts as follows: a charged-off private student loan in the amount of $5,943; a \n$20,071 balance due after repossession of an automobile; and two collection accounts \nfor student loans with the U.S. Department of Education in the amounts of $12,224 and \n$17,413. In total, the SOR alleges indebtedness of about $55,651. \nIn his answers, Applicant admitted the two federal student loans in collection. He \ndenied (although essentially admitted) the charged-off private student loan, explaining \nthe account now had a balance of $0. And he denied (although essentially admitted) the \n$20,071 delinquency, explaining it was paid off in November 2020. In addition to his \nadmissions, the four delinquent accounts are established by a July 2018 credit report, \nwhich was obtained during his background investigation. (Exhibit 5) He did not disclose \nany delinquent accounts in his security clearance application, although he noted he had \nfiled tax returns late and paid all penalties.

(Exhibit 5 at 9) Applicant explained and provided reliable documentation that \nthe account now has a $0 balance because the debt was cancelled or forgiven as part \nof a nation-wide settlement agreement obtained by the U.S. Bureau of Consumer \nFinancial Protection. (January 2021 Answer, Attachment A) The October 2020 letter \nfrom the creditor specifically states that Applicant is \u201cno longer obligated to make any \npayment on your [private student] loan.\u201d I find this account is resolved in Applicant\u2019s \nfavor. \nThe July 2018 credit report described the $20,071 delinquent debt as a charged-\noff account, and the merchandise was taken back by grantor with a possible balance \ndue. (Exhibit 5 at 10) The debt stems from a $54,100 auto loan that resulted in \nrepossession of the vehicle in May 2018. Applicant explained and provided reliable \ndocumentation that the account now has a $0 balance. (May 2020 Answer; March 2021 \nSupplement Answer, Attachments for SOR \u00b6 1.b) His paperwork shows he paid a total \nof $1,400 over several months. The December 2020 letter from the creditor confirms \nthat there are no further payments due on the account. Although it is unclear if Applicant \npaid off the debt in full or settled it for a lesser amount, it\u2019s clear that the account has \nhad a $0 balance since December 2020. I find this account is resolved in Applicant\u2019s \nfavor. \nThe July 2018 credit report described the two federal student loans as collection \naccounts in the amounts of $12,224 and $17,413. (Exhibit 5 at 9) In an attempt to \nresolve the accounts, Applicant applied to have the Department of Education discharge \nthe debts due to the closing of the educational institution he attended. (May 2020 \nAnswer; January 2021 Answer; and March 2021 Supplement Answer, Attachments for \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c and 1.d) He submitted the discharge application in November 2020. He has \nyet to receive a reply to his discharge application. \nIn his April 2021 reply to the FORM, Applicant submitted reliable documentation \nshowing that in March 2021 he entered into a rehabilitation agreement for his two \ndefaulted federal student loans. (Exhibit A) The rehabilitation agreement calls for \nincome-based repayment at the rate of $27 per month for at least nine monthly \npayments beginning April 28, 2021, at which point his defaulted loans would be \nconsidered rehabilitated and eligible for a repayment plan. The paperwork from the \nDepartment of Education shows a total balance due of about $32,243. \nApplicant\u2019s history of financial problems or difficulties is not limited to the four \naccounts discussed above. Because these matters are not alleged in the SOR, I have \nconsidered them for the limited purpose of evaluating Applicant\u2019s evidence in mitigation. \nHis financial problems date back to at least 2003, and are discussed below. \nBy 2003, Applicant\u2019s overall financial situation was such that he sought relief by \nfiling a voluntary Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition. (Exhibit 6) The purpose of a Chapter 7 \ncase is to allow a debtor to obtain a fresh start, free from creditors and free from the \npressures of excessive indebtedness.

(Exhibit 6) \nIn addition to the four delinquent debts in the SOR, the July 2018 credit report \nreflects four other collection accounts. (Exhibit 5 at 8-10) The first is a $725 collection \naccount for a charged-off credit card account. The second is a collection account, with a \n$0 balance, that was settled for less than the balance in full. The third is a collection \naccount, with a $0 balance, that was settled for less than the balance in full. And the \nfourth is a collection account, with a $0 balance, described as a paid charged-off \naccount. \nApplicant\u2019s financial history also includes tax problems, as he mentioned briefly \nin his 2018 security clearance application. (Exhibit 4 at Section 26) He provided a few \nmore details during his 2018 background investigation. (Exhibit 10 at 3) He stated that \nhe did not file income tax returns for 2004, 2007, 2008, and 2009. He further stated that \nhe sought out professional assistance in 2017, which resulted in a plan to resolve back \ntaxes. \nLaw and Policies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (E.O.) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; Department of \nDefense Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review \nProgram (January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security \nAdjudicative Guidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or \nEligibility to Hold a Sensitive Position (AG), effective June 8, 2017. \nIt is well-established law that no one has a right to a security clearance.1 As \nnoted by the Supreme Court in Department of the Navy v. Egan, \u201cthe clearly consistent \nstandard indicates that security clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the \nside of denials.\u201d2 Under Egan, Executive Order 10865, and the Directive, any doubt \nabout whether an applicant should be allowed access to classified information will be \nresolved in favor of protecting national security. In Egan, the Supreme Court stated that \nthe burden of proof is less than a preponderance of evidence.3 The Appeal Board has \nfollowed the Court\u2019s reasoning, and a judge\u2019s findings of fact are reviewed under the \nsubstantial-evidence standard.4 \n1  Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528 (1988) (\u201cit should be obvious that no one has a \n\u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance\u201d); Duane v.

The overall concern is set forth in AG \n\u00b6 18 as follows: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . \nThe concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified or sensitive information to obtain money or something else of \nvalue. It encompasses concerns about a person\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other \nimportant qualities. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified or sensitive \ninformation. \nIn analyzing the facts of this case, I considered the following disqualifying \nconditions as most pertinent: \nAG \u00b6 19(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \nAG \u00b6 19(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe evidence supports a conclusion that Applicant has a history of financial \nproblems or difficulties that is sufficient to raise a security concern under Guideline F. \nThe disqualifying conditions noted above apply here to the four delinquent accounts in \nthe SOR. \nApplicant has not sufficiently explained, extenuated, or mitigated his history of \nfinancial problems.

The length of Applicant\u2019s compliance with this agreement is \nof short duration. Accordingly, it is simply too soon to tell if he will adhere to the \nagreement. \nSimilarly, if Applicant satisfies the rehabilitation agreement, the loan servicer will \ncalculate a new monthly payment based on the balance owed at the time of \nrehabilitation, and the monthly payment may substantially increase. (Exhibit A) The \noutstanding balance on the loans was more than $30,000 as of March 2021. Given \nthese circumstances, coupled with Applicant\u2019s history of financial problems or difficulties \ndating back to 2003, I have doubts about Applicant\u2019s ability or willingness or both to \nadhere to his plan to repay the defaulted student loans. \n \nFollowing Egan and the clearly consistent standard, I have doubts and concerns \nabout Applicant\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, good judgment, and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. In reaching this conclusion, I weighed the evidence \nas a whole and considered if the favorable evidence outweighed the unfavorable \nevidence or vice versa. I also considered the whole-person concept.

Based upon a review of the pleadings and exhibits, \nnational security eligibility is denied. \nStatement of Case \nOn March 4, 2020, the Department of Defense Consolidated Adjudications Facility \n(DoD CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) to Applicant, detailing security \nconcerns under Guideline H (Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse). Applicant \nresponded to the SOR on March 19, 2020, and requested that his case be decided by an \nadministrative judge on the written record without a hearing. \nOn December 18, 2020, Department Counsel submitted the Government\u2019s written \ncase. A complete copy of the File of Relevant Material (FORM), containing five Items, \nwas mailed to Applicant on December 18, 2020, and received by him on January 4, 2021. \nThe FORM notified Applicant that he had an opportunity to file objections and submit \nmaterial in refutation, extenuation, or mitigation within 30 days of receipt of the FORM. \n1 \n\n \nApplicant did not respond to the FORM or object to Items 1 through 5 within the time \nprovided, nor did he request an extension of time to do so. Hence, all Items are admitted \ninto evidence. On March 25, 2021, the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) \nassigned the case to me. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the three SOR allegations contained in SOR Paragraph 1, \nwithout further elaboration or explanation. (Item 2) His admissions are incorporated into \nthese findings of fact. \nApplicant is 24 years old. He is unmarried and has no children. He earned a \nbachelor\u2019s degree in May 2019. He has no military or federal civil service, and has never \nheld a security clearance. He began his current employment as an analyst with a defense \ncontractor in May 2019, and is seeking national security eligibility in connection with that \nposition. (Item 3.) \nApplicant completed his Questionnaire for National Security Positions (SF-86) on \nMay 9, 2019. In response to questions in Section 23 regarding illegal use of drugs or drug \nactivity, he disclosed that he had used THC/marijuana/cannabis three to four times per \nweek, from October 2013 to May 2019, for medical use to treat insomnia and anxiety \ninstead of using a prescription drug, which had formerly given him unpleasant side effects. \nHe further declared that he intended to continue using the drug in the future because it \nwas legal in the local jurisdiction where he lived and it improves his health. (Item 3.) \nOn July 1, 2019, Applicant was interviewed by an investigator for the Office of \nPersonnel Management (OPM). He confirmed the accuracy of his SF-86 statements \nconcerning drug use, and added that he also smoked the marijuana because he had \ndepression and ADHD. He said that he had undergone counseling for three to four years \nduring high school for depression, anxiety, ADHD, and insomnia, and his counselor was \nsupportive of his marijuana use for these medical conditions. He did not report any \ncounseling after his 2015 graduation from high school. He said he had purchased \nmarijuana from dispensaries, smoke shops, and a college friend. He also obtained it from \nfriends when they shared and smoked it together. (Item 4.) \nConcerning his intention to continue using marijuana, as expressed in his SF-86, \nApplicant confirmed that his prior statements were accurate, and that he continued to use \nmarijuana as described during May and June 2019. He told the investigator that he was \naware that it is illegal to use illegal drugs or controlled substances while employed with \nthe Federal government and that he respects the law. He stated that he would stop using \nmarijuana if he needed to for his job with the defense contractor or to get a security \nclearance, and claimed that he could not be blackmailed or coerced due to his drug use. \n(Item 4.) \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe record contains no evidence concerning Applicant\u2019s job performance, \ntrustworthiness, character in a professional setting, or track record with respect to \nhandling sensitive information and observation of security procedures. I was unable to \nevaluate his credibility, demeanor, or character in person, since he elected to have his \ncase decided without a hearing. \nPolicies \nThe national security eligibility action was taken under Executive Order 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; \nDoD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program \n(January 2, 1992), as amended (Directive); and the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AG), which became effective within the DoD on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying conditions and mitigating \nconditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. The entire \nprocess is a conscientious scrutiny of applicable guidelines in the context of a number of \nvariables known as the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider \nall available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. I have not drawn inferences based on mere speculation or \nconjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person applying for national security eligibility seeks to enter into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \n3 \n\ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants national \nsecurity eligibility. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk the \napplicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified or sensitive information. \nFinally, as emphasized in Section 7 of Executive Order 10865, \u201c[a]ny determination \nunder this order adverse to an applicant shall be a determination in terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information.) \n[Note: Department Counsel\u2019s ARGUMENT section of the FORM contains a \nnumber of typographical errors, and erroneously cites the superseded 2006 adjudicative \nguidelines in footnote 9. Her substantive discussion, however, addressed accurate \ncontents of the current SEAD 4 AG. I found no basis for concern that these errors \nconfused or otherwise prejudiced Applicant\u2019s right to due process, and accordingly find \nthey were harmless.] \nAnalysis \nGuideline H: Drug Involvement and Substance Misuse \nAG \u00b6 24 describes the security concerns related to this guideline: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual's reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior may \nlead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person's ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" as \ndefined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term adopted in \nthis guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \nAG \u00b6 25 sets out conditions that could raise security concerns and may be \ndisqualifying. Three are established in this case: \n(a) any substance misuse (see above definition); \n(c) illegal possession of a controlled substance, including cultivation, \nprocessing, manufacture, purchase, sale, or distribution; or possession of \ndrug paraphernalia; and \n4 \n\n(g) expressed intent to continue drug involvement and substance misuse, \nor failure to clearly and convincingly commit to discontinue such misuse. \nApplicant purchased and used marijuana, or other cannabis-derived THC \nproducts, on a regular basis from October 2013 until at least June 2019, and expressed \nhis intention to continue doing so. His statement to the OPM investigator, that he would \nstop using marijuana if he needed to for his job or to get a security clearance, does not \nconstitute a clear and convincing commitment to discontinue his ongoing substance \nmisuse. The evidence raised the above disqualifying conditions, thereby shifting the \nburden to Applicant to rebut, extenuate, or mitigate those concerns. \nAG \u00b6 26 lists three conditions that could mitigate security concerns raised under \nthis guideline: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and substance \nmisuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this problem, and \nhas established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not limited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; and \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \nThe record evidence does not support any of the listed mitigating conditions. \nApplicant\u2019s illegal drug use began when he was 16 years old, and continued on a regular \nbasis with no record evidence to indicate that it ever stopped. He took no action to \novercome the problem, and failed to recognize or acknowledge that he needed to. No \nmitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 26(a) or 26 (b) was established. Applicant has neither sought nor \nparticipated in any drug treatment, rehabilitation, or aftercare program; and no medical \nprofessional supplied a favorable prognosis. There is no evidence to establish mitigation \nunder AG \u00b6 26(d). \n5 \n\nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAccording to AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for \na security clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the applicable guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \npertinent facts and circumstances surrounding this case. Applicant\u2019s lengthy, and \napparently ongoing, pattern of illegally purchasing and using controlled substances \nleaves me with significant doubts as to his eligibility for a security clearance. His statement \nto the OPM investigator that he would stop using illegal drugs if he needed to for his job \nor to obtain a security clearance is neither convincing nor mitigating. His regular violations \nof Federal criminal law for his personal benefit and enjoyment preclude a reasonable \nconclusion that he could be relied upon to comply with security-related requirements for \nthe protection of classified and sensitive information that he might find to be inconvenient \nor burdensome. He did not met his burden to mitigate the security concerns arising under \nthe guideline for drug involvement and substance misuse. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline H: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c \nAgainst Applicant \n6 \n\nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant access to classified \ninformation.

He worked for a large company \nbetween February 2017 and September 2017, just before he was hired by his current \nemployer. \nIn response to Section 26 (Financial Record) of his 2019 SCA, Applicant \ndisclosed he had financial problems that led to his filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOctober 2015, with a subsequent discharge of his dischargeable debts in March 2016. \nHe stated: \u201cFiled bankruptcy due to many debts such as payday loans and not enough \nincome at the time to pay my debts off.\u201d (Item 3, Section 26, Financial Record.) \nApplicant failed to disclose any additional delinquent accounts. \nThe subsequent background investigation addressed his financial situation and \nrevealed the delinquent accounts alleged in the SOR. During his July 2019 interview \nwith a government investigator, Applicant discussed his delinquent accounts, and that \nhe and his spouse filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2015. He explained that they began \nto have financial difficulties in 2012, when they started to overspend and take out \npayday loans to pay their bills. He told the investigator that the interest on the payday \nloans were so high (200 percent monthly interest or higher), that he could not afford to \npay them. Applicant noted that his wife was not working at the time, and he was the only \nprovider. He implied that his income was insufficient to meet their living expenses and \npay their debts. (Item 4). \nApplicant told the investigator that he and his wife were separated pending \ndivorce. At the time of the interview, he was living with his parents to save money. He \nnoted that the accounts he discussed with the investigator were not covered in the \nbankruptcy discharge. With the exception of SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i ($822) and 1.k ($242), all of the \naccounts alleged in the SOR were opened after his Chapter 7 discharge. Applicant \nestimated that he was discharged of about $20,000 in debts. Most of the debts reported \nin the credit bureau reports involved student loans. His October 2019 credit bureau \nreport shows $152,831 in deferred student loans assigned to the U.S. Government \ncurrently in deferment. (Items 6, 7) \nDuring his 2019 interview, Applicant promised the investigator that he would \ncontact his creditors and make arrangements to pay his delinquent debts. He noted that \nhe was making a good salary with his employer, implying that he would be able to pay \nthe debts. He had made no payments on any of his delinquent accounts up to the day of \nthe interview. Applicant presented no documentary evidence of any efforts to settle, \npay, or otherwise resolve any of the SOR debts. These debts are unresolved. \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that he had taken steps to improve his \ncredit. He noted that he had two new credit card accounts that he was paying on time, \nand that he just purchased a new car in 2020. He stated \u201cI still have plan to pay off my \ndebt that I do owe.\u201d (SOR answer.) Presumably, he obtained the new credit cards and \npurchased the car with a view of rebuilding his credit. \nApplicant did not present evidence of his current financial situation (gross \nmonthly income, deductions, monthly expenses, and monthly net remainder). He did not \npresent evidence to show that he has a working budget. There is no evidence to show \nApplicant has had recent financial counseling, except for the counseling he received \nduring his bankruptcy filing. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPolicies \nThe SOR was issued under Executive Order (Exec.

Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing \nthat \u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 \nU.S. 518, 528 (1988). \nThe AGs list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating \ncondition is not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case \ncan be measured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to \nclassified information. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense \nconsideration of the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and \n2(f). All available, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, must be considered. \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, \nthe burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship \nwith the Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a \ncompelling interest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, \nreliability, and trustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own. \nThe \u201cclearly consistent with the national interest\u201d standard compels resolution of any \nreasonable doubt about an applicant\u2019s suitability for access in favor of the Government. \n\u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if they must, on the side of denials.\u201d \nEgan, 484 U.S. at 531; SEAD 4, \u00b6 E(4); SEAD 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 1(d) and 2(b). Clearance \ndecisions are not a determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are \nmerely an indication that the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the \nGovernment has established for issuing a clearance. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern relating to financial problems: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . .  \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems are documented in the record. The delinquent \ndebts alleged in the SOR are established by his admissions and the record evidence. \nAG \u00b6 19 provides disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts,\u201d and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d The record established these disqualifying conditions, \nrequiring additional inquiry about the possible applicability of mitigating conditions. \nI considered the seven financial considerations mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 \n20; however, only one is potentially applicable: \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely \nbeyond the person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances. \nThe Appeal Board concisely explained an applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving \nthe applicability of mitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a securit\n \ny clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2, \u00b6 2(b). ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 \n(App. Bd. Sep. 24, 2013). \nThe AG \u00b6 20(b) financial considerations mitigating condition is not fully \nestablished by the facts in this case and does not mitigate the security concerns. \nApplicant\u2019s financial problems started in about 2012, before he filed for Chapter 7 \nbankruptcy in 2015. After his 2016 bankruptcy discharge, he acquired the delinquent \naccounts alleged in the SOR, totaling about $47,480, all of which are still ongoing and \nunresolved. Applicant\u2019s evidence is somewhat sufficient to establish that circumstances \nbeyond his control contributed to his financial problems, i.e., his period of \nunemployment and his separation from his wife. \nNotwithstanding, Applicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to establish that he has been \nfinancially responsible under the circumstances. There is no evidence to show that he is \nfollowing a budget or received recent financial counseling. Applicant submitted no \nevidence of good-faith efforts to resolve his debts before he submitted his 2019 SCA; \nafter he was interviewed by a Government investigator about his delinquencies in 2019; \nafter he received the 2020 SOR; or after he received the FORM. AG \u00b6 20(d) is not \napplicable. \nApplicant failed to submit documentary evidence of his current financial situation \n(gross monthly income, deductions, monthly expenses, and monthly net remainder) to \nshow his ability to be financially responsible. Considering the evidence as a whole, \nApplicant\u2019s evidence is insufficient to demonstrate his financial responsibility, that his \nfinancial problems are being resolved, and that he has the financial ability to pay his \ndebts. The financial considerations security concerns are not mitigated. \nThe SOR alleged 12 accounts creating financial considerations concerns. Filing \nfor bankruptcy is a legal recourse to resolve financial distress. SOR \u00b6 1.l is resolved for \nApplicant. \nWhole-Person Concept \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case, and under the whole-person \nconcept. Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, App. A, \u00b6\u00b6 2(a) and 2(d). I have \nincorporated my comments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of \nthese factors were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional \ncomment: \nApplicant, 39, has been fully employed with a Federal contractor since 2017. His \nevidence is insufficient to establish a track record of financial responsibility. It is well \nsettled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security clearance eligibility, \nthere is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. Unmitigated \nfinancial considerations security concerns lead me to conclude that granting a security \nclearance to Applicant is not warranted. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n          \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:   \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a-1.k: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.l: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national security interests of the United States to grant \nApplicant eligibility for a security clearance.

He has \nbeen working with a \u201cfinancial advisor . . . since 2017.\u201d (AppX J.) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s national security eligibility, the administrative \njudge must consider the adjudicative guidelines (AG). In addition to brief introductory \nexplanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially disqualifying \nconditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an applicant\u2019s \nnational security eligibility. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the whole-person concept. The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states the \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who applies for access to classified information seeks to enter into a \nfiduciary relationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or \nsafeguard classified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally \npermissible extrapolation as to potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of \nclassified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order (EO) 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall \nbe \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the \nloyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information).   \nAnalysis \nGuideline F - Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for Financial Considerations is set \nout in AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. One is potentially applicable in this case:  \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant had not filed Federal and state income tax returns for tax years \n2012~2014, when the SOR was issued. The evidence is sufficient to raise this \ndisqualifying condition. \nAG \u00b6 20 provides conditions that could mitigate security concerns. I considered \nall of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 including: \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax \nauthority to file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant is current with his Federal and state income tax filings. Mitigation under \nAG \u00b6 20 has been established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security\nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration\nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept.  \n \n \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under those guidelines, but some warrant additional comment. Applicant is \nhighly respected in the workplace and in his community as evidenced by seven letters \nof recommendation.

For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated the Financial Considerations security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by \u00b6 E3.1.25 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a:  \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant national security eligibility \nfor a security clearance.

Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is denied. \n \nStatement of the Case \n \nOn January 29, 2019, Applicant submitted a Questionnaire for National Security \nPositions (SF-86). On March 12, 2020, the Defense Counterintelligence and Security \nAgency, Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) issued a Statement of Reasons \n(SOR) to Applicant detailing security concerns under Guidelines H and E. The SOR \ndetailed reasons why the CAF was unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue a security clearance for Applicant.  \n \nOn April 14, 2020, Applicant submitted his Answer to the SOR through counsel. \nWhen Applicant submitted his SOR Answer, he was represented by counsel, but he \nwas no longer represented by counsel at his hearing. On November 27, 2020, \nDepartment Counsel was ready to proceed. On December 15, 2020, the Defense Office \nof Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) assigned the case to me. On February 18, 2021, \n\n \n2 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nDOHA issued a notice of hearing scheduling the hearing for March 23, 2021. The \nhearing was convened as scheduled. Department Counsel submitted Government \nExhibits (GE) 1 through 4, which were admitted without objection. Applicant testified, \ncalled one witness to testify on his behalf, and submitted Applicant Exhibit (AE) 1, a \nthree-ring binder containing Tabs A  through Q, which was admitted without objection. \nOn April 2, 2021, DOHA received the hearing transcript (Tr.).  \n \nFindings of Fact \n \nBackground Information \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old program manager employed by a defense contractor \nsince December 2006. (GE 1; Tr. 11-12) He seeks to retain his security clearance, \nwhich he has held since March 2009. (Tr. 12-14)  \n \nApplicant received his high school diploma in June 2002. He was awarded a \nBachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering in December 2006. (AE 1(H); Tr. \n14-17) Applicant married in January 2014, and has an 18-year-old stepdaughter and a \n9-year-old daughter. Applicant\u2019s wife is not employed outside the home. (GE 1; Tr. 17-\n19)  \n \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nApplicant self-reported past marijuana use on his January 29, 2019 SF-86 during \nhis periodic security clearance renewal. (GE 1) He was subsequently interviewed on \nMay 23, 2019, by an Office of Personnel Management (OPM) investigator regarding his \nmarijuana use. (GE 2) He elaborated on his marijuana use in his April 14, 2020 SOR \nAnswer as well as during his testimony. The following summarizes that drug use. \n \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleged that from approximately June 2003 through at least December \n2018, Applicant purchased and used marijuana with varying frequency; and SOR \u00b6 1.b \nalleged that Applicant continued to purchase and use marijuana after he had been \ngranted a DOD security clearance in March 2009. \n \nIn his SOR Answer, Applicant stated that he did not remember exactly what year \nhe first used marijuana. His best estimate is that he first used marijuana sometime \nbetween 2003 and 2005, which was between 15 and 17 years from the time he \nsubmitted his SOR Answer. He used marijuana approximately two or three times per \nyear, if that, until 2018 when his marijuana use increased to approximately one to two \ntimes per month for a short period. His increased marijuana use in 2018 came about \nwhen recreational marijuana use became legal in his state of residence. He stated that \nhe was under the mistaken belief that its use was acceptable at the federal level as well. \nApplicant acknowledged his marijuana use was \u201cextremely improvident\u201d and added that \nhe has no intention to ever use marijuana or any other drug again. Applicant\u2019s testimony \nwas consistent with his January 29, 2019 SF-86 and his SOR Answer. (SOR Answer; \nTr. 19-22; GE 1; AE 1(Q)) \n \n\n \n3 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nApplicant used marijuana for \u201crecreational use\u201d and for its \u201crelaxing capabilities \nevery now and then.\u201d Applicant added that he used marijuana about 20 times while \nholding a clearance from March 2009 to December 2018, further adding that that \nnumber was \u201cjust a guess.\u201d He acknowledged that his marijuana use was a violation of \nstate and Federal law, security clearance regulations, and his employer\u2019s drug-free \nworkplace policy. Applicant volunteered that his marijuana use was a \u201cpoor choice.\u201d (Tr. \n24-26)  \n \nThe driving force behind Applicant\u2019s decision to quit using marijuana occurred \nwhen he was renewing his security clearance application in December 2018. He stated, \n\u201cit really dawned on me I shouldn\u2019t have done it, and it was a poor choice.\u201d Applicant \nhas used marijuana with his wife. His wife still uses marijuana, which is legal in their \nstate of residence. Applicant stated that even though he has been around individuals to \ninclude his wife who use marijuana, he is not tempted to use it anymore. (GE 2; Tr. 26-\n29, 33-35) Applicant stated, \u201ctrustworthiness is one of the most important parts of \nhaving a Security Clearance. You don\u2019t want someone that lies. . . . You make \nmistakes, you\u2019ve got to own up to it. So, that\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d (Tr. 57) \n \nDuring Applicant\u2019s March 2, 2009 OPM interview, he told the investigator that he \n\u201cstopped (using marijuana) in 2007 because the use no longer appealed to him and he \nwanted to start a career.\u201d (GE 4; Tr. 29-30) \n \nPersonal Conduct  \n \nThe concerns identified under this Guideline are listed as two separate \nallegations and discussed in order as indicated in the SOR. \n \nThe Government cross-alleged the drug involvement and substance misuse \nconcern alleged in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.b under SOR \u00b6 2.a. Additionally, the SOR alleged \nthat Applicant falsified his December 29, 2008 SF-86 when he disclosed marijuana use \nfrom November 2005 through July 2007, and purportedly failed to disclose his \ncontinuing use of marijuana as set forth in SOR \u00b6 1.a. \n \nApplicant denied falsifying his December 2008 SF-86. He explained that when he \ncompleted his December 2008 SF-86, he was not using marijuana and had not done so \nsince July 2007. He emphasized the information he provided on his December 2008 \nSF-86 was accurate, as he was not using marijuana at that time. (SOR Answer; Tr. 22-\n24) Apparently, the confusion over the \u201ccontinuing use\u201d question arose when Applicant \nsubmitted his January 29, 2019 SF-86 and estimated his marijuana use as June 2003 to \nJune 2017. (GE 1; Tr. 24) \n \nCharacter Evidence \n \n \nApplicant called one character witness (CW) to testify on his behalf, a technical \ndirector and co-worker he has known since 2013. CW has held a clearance since \napproximately 1985. CW provided a favorable professional and personal assessment of \nApplicant. She stated among other things that Applicant is trustworthy, loyal, and she \n\n \n4 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nhas no reason to question his ability to hold a security clearance. CW did concede on \ncross-examination that following the law, rules, regulations, and company policy is an \nimportant part of holding a security clearance. CW acknowledged that Applicant made \nmistakes and errors in judgment. That said, she noted that he self-reported his \nmarijuana use and based on her first-hand knowledge of him believes that he will not \nrepeat those mistakes. CW also submitted a reference letter. (AE 1(P); Tr. 36-48) \n \n \nApplicant submitted performance reviews covering the years 2017 to 2020, \nnumerous professional certificates and awards, and six reference letters. The \ncumulative nature of this evidence documents that Applicant has excelled in his \nprofessional capacity and in that capacity has contributed to the national defense. He is \ntechnically competent, well liked, trusted, and respected by his peers and management. \n(SOR Answer; AE 1(A) \u2013 1(P); Tr. 50-56) \n \nPolicies \n \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \n \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \n \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The \nadministrative judge\u2019s overarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and \ncommonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious \nscrutiny of a number of variables known as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a decision. \n \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d  \n \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable clearance \ndecision.  \n\n \n5 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \n \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that adverse decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the \nnational interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the \napplicant concerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites \nfor access to classified or sensitive information). \n  \nAnalysis \n \nDrug Involvement and Substance Misuse \n \nAG \u00b6 24 provides the security concern arising from drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse stating: \nThe illegal use of controlled substances, to include the misuse of \nprescription and non-prescription drugs, and the use of other substances \nthat cause physical or mental impairment or are used in a manner \ninconsistent with their intended purpose can raise questions about an \nindividual\u2019s reliability and trustworthiness, both because such behavior \nmay lead to physical or psychological impairment and because it raises \nquestions about a person\u2019s ability or willingness to comply with laws, rules, \nand regulations. Controlled substance means any \"controlled substance\" \nas defined in 21 U.S.C. 802. Substance misuse is the generic term \nadopted in this guideline to describe any of the behaviors listed above. \n \nAG \u00b6 25 provides three conditions that could raise a security concern and may \nbe disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) any substance misuse (see above definition)\u201d; \u201c(c) \nillegal possession of a controlled substance, including . . . purchase. . . ;\u201d and \u201c(f) any \nillegal drug use while granted access to classified information or holding a sensitive \nposition.\u201d From about 2003 to December 2018, Applicant purchased and used \nmarijuana with varying frequency. He continued to purchase and use marijuana after he \nwas granted a security clearance in March 2009. He possessed marijuana before he \nused it. Further review is required. \n \nSchedules I, II, III, IV, and V, as referred to in the Controlled Substances Act are \ncontained in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 812(c). Marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substances. See \nDrug \nEnforcement \nAdministration \nlisting \nat \nhttps://www.deadiversion.usdoj.gov/schedules/marijuana/index.html. See also Gonzales \nv. Raish, 545 U.S. 1 (2005) (discussing placement of marijuana on Schedule I). \n\n \n6 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nAG \u00b6 26 lists four conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or happened \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur or does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the individual acknowledges his or her drug involvement and \nsubstance misuse, provides evidence of actions taken to overcome this \nproblem, and has established a pattern of abstinence, including, but not \nlimited to: \n(1) disassociation from drug-using associates and contacts; \n(2) changing or avoiding the environment where drugs were used; \nand \n(3) providing a signed statement of intent to abstain from all drug \ninvolvement and substance misuse, acknowledging that any future \ninvolvement or misuse is grounds for revocation of national security \neligibility; \n(c) abuse of prescription drugs was after a severe or prolonged illness \nduring which these drugs were prescribed, and abuse has since ended; \nand \n(d) satisfactory completion of a prescribed drug treatment program, \nincluding, but not limited to, rehabilitation and aftercare requirements, \nwithout recurrence of abuse, and a favorable prognosis by a duly qualified \nmedical professional. \n \nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance \nof a security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for \naccess to classified information will be resolved in favor of the national \nsecurity.\u201d Directive, Enclosure 2, [App. A] \u00b6 2(b). \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully applies; however, Applicant provided some \nimportant mitigating information. He voluntarily disclosed his marijuana use on his \n\n \n7 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nJanuary 2019 SF-86, during his May 2019 OPM interview, in his SOR response, and \nduring his hearing. He ended his marijuana use around December 2018. He promised \nnot to use marijuana in the future. \n \nThe evidence against mitigation is more persuasive at this time. In ISCR Case \nNo. 16-03460 at 4 (App. Bd. May 24, 2018), the applicant had a history of marijuana \nuse, and the Appeal Board said: \nA clearance adjudication is aimed at determining if an applicant has the \nrequisite judgment and reliability to abide by rules designed to protect \nclassified information. . . . [Security concerns arise if] there is doubt as to \nwhether he [or she] will follow the regulatory requirements for handling \nclassified information, which might, in the event, appear burdensome. \nAccess to national secrets entails a fiduciary duty to the U.S. A person \nwho enters into such a fiduciary relationship is charged with abiding by \nlegal and regulatory guidance regardless of whether he or she believes \nthat guidance to be wise. \n \nApplicant\u2019s marijuana use occurred after Applicant completed his December \n2008 SF-86, after his March 2009 OPM interview, and after being granted a security \nclearance in March 2009. \u201cAn applicant who uses marijuana after having been placed \non notice of its security significance, such as using after having completed a clearance \napplication, may be lacking in the qualities expected of those with access to national \nsecrets.\u201d ISCR Case No. 17-03191 at 3 (App. Bd. Mar. 26, 2019) (citing ISCR Case No. \n17-04198 at 2 (App. Bd. Jan. 15, 2019) (\u201cAn applicant\u2019s misuse of drugs after having \nbeen placed on notice of the incompatibility of drug abuse with clearance eligibility \nraises questions about his or her judgment and reliability\u201d).) Applicant\u2019s spouse and \nsome of his friends are marijuana users, and it is likely that he will be in the vicinity of \nmarijuana in the future. It is too soon after his abstinence from marijuana use beginning \nin December 2018, to rule out the likelihood of his future marijuana use. Guideline H \nsecurity concerns are not mitigated at this time. \nPersonal Conduct \n \nAG \u00b6 15 provides the security concern arising from personal conduct: \n \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual's reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. \n \n \n \n \n\n \n8 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nAG \u00b6 16 provides two conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case: \n  \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; and \n \n(e) personal conduct, or concealment of information about one\u2019s conduct, \nthat creates a vulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress by a \nforeign intelligence entity or other individual or group. Such conduct \nincludes:  \n \n(1) engaging in activities which, if known, could affect the \nperson\u2019s personal, professional, or community standing. \n \n \nApplicant denied deliberately falsifying his December 2008 SF-86 regarding his \npast drug use. As noted, the apparent confusion arose when Applicant submitted his \nJanuary 2019 SF-86 and estimated his marijuana use as June 2003 to June 2017. In \nlight of Applicant\u2019s explanation, discussed above, I accept his explanation as credible \nand find for him with regard to SOR \u00b6 2.b. However, Applicant continued to use \nmarijuana after completing his December 2008 SF-86, his March 2009 OPM interview, \nand after being granted a security clearance in March 2009. The general concern under \nAG \u00b6 15 and specific concern under AG \u00b6 16(e) apply. Further review is required. \n \n \nAG \u00b6 17 lists seven conditions that could mitigate security concerns: \n \n(a) the individual made prompt, good-faith efforts to correct the omission, \nconcealment, or falsification before being confronted with the facts; \n \n(b) the refusal or failure to cooperate, omission, or concealment was \ncaused or significantly contributed to by advice of legal counsel or of a \nperson with professional responsibilities for advising or instructing the \nindividual specifically concerning security processes. Upon being made \naware of the requirement to cooperate or provide the information, the \nindividual cooperated fully and truthfully; \n \n(c) the offense is so minor, or so much time has passed, or the behavior is \nso infrequent, or it happened under such unique circumstances that it is \nunlikely to recur and does not cast doubt on the individual's reliability, \ntrustworthiness, or good judgment; \n \n(d) the individual has acknowledged the behavior and obtained counseling \nto change the behavior or taken other positive steps to alleviate the \nstressors, circumstances, or factors that contributed to untrustworthy, \n\n \n9 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nunreliable, or other inappropriate behavior, and such behavior is unlikely \nto recur; \n \n(e) the individual has taken positive steps to reduce or eliminate \nvulnerability to exploitation, manipulation, or duress;  \n \n(f) the information was unsubstantiated or from a source of questionable \nreliability; and \n \n(g) association with persons involved in criminal activity was unwitting, has \nceased, or occurs under circumstances that do not cast doubt upon the \nindividual's reliability, trustworthiness, judgment, or willingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations.  \n \nNone of the mitigating conditions fully apply. Applicant continued to use \nmarijuana after his initial disclosure of marijuana use on his December 2008 SF-86, \nfollowed by his assurances to an OPM investigator in March 2009 that he stopped using \nmarijuana in 2007 and wanted to pursue his career. Following these representations, he \nwas granted a security clearance in March 2009 and used marijuana intermittently for a \nten-year period while hold a security clearance. He used marijuana knowing that it \nviolated state and Federal law as well as company policy. Applicant is to be \ncommended for self-reporting his past marijuana use and his assurances that he \nstopped using marijuana in December 2018. However, those assurances ring hollow \nafter ten years of infrequent recreational marijuana use while holding a security \nclearance.   \n  \nWhole-Person Concept \n Under the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the\ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable\nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the\nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to\nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of\nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation\nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or\nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe ultimate determination whether to grant national security eligibility must be an \noverall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the guidelines and \nthe whole-person concept. AG \u00b6 2(c). The discussion under Guidelines H and E is \nincorporated in this whole-person section. However, further comments are warranted. \n\n \n10 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n \nApplicant is a 37-year-old program manager, who has been working for a \ndefense contractor since 2006. In 2006, he was awarded a bachelor\u2019s degree in \nmechanical engineering. Applicant has enjoyed a highly successful career as a defense \ncontractor. There is no evidence of security violations, improper disclosure of classified \ninformation, or that Applicant compromised national security. See ISCR Case No. 18-\n02581 at 4 (App. Bd. Jan. 14, 2020) (noting admissibility of \u201cgood security record,\u201d and \ncommenting that security concerns may nevertheless not be mitigated). \n \nApplicant disclosed his marijuana use on his January 2019 SF-86, and during his \nMay 2019 OPM interview, SOR response, and hearing. An honest and candid self-\nreport of drug abuse is an important indication that, if granted security clearance \neligibility, the individual would disclose any threats to national security, even if the \ndisclosure involves an issue that might damage his or her own career or personal \nreputation. However, the mitigating weight of Applicant\u2019s disclosures is undermined by \nhis marijuana use after his March 2009 OPM interview. A 15-month period of \nabstinence from December 2018 to March 2021, the date of his hearing, is insufficient \nto overcome a ten-year period of marijuana use while holding a security clearance and \ncontinued his ongoing exposure to marijuana.   \n \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. \u201c[A] favorable clearance decision means that the \nrecord discloses no basis for doubt about an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to \nclassified information.\u201d ISCR Case No. 18-02085 at 7 (App. Bd. Jan. 3, 2020) (citing \nISCR Case No. 12-00270 at 3 (App. Bd. Jan. 17, 2014)). At the expense of being \nrepetitive, Applicant\u2019s self-reporting of his marijuana use is commendable and shows \nconsiderable strength of character. If Applicant continues on his current path of \nremaining drug-free, he will in all likelihood establish a track record that will lead to a \nmore favorable outcome should he reapply for a security clearance.   \n \nI have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, Exec. Or. 10865, the \nDirective, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the facts and \ncircumstances in the context of the whole person. Applicant mitigated the falsification \nconcerns under personal conduct; however, he failed to mitigate a pattern of rule \nviolations under personal conduct and drug involvement and substance misuse security \nconcerns. \nFormal Findings \n \nThe formal findings on the allegations set forth in the SOR are as follows: \n \n \n \nParagraph 1, Guideline H:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n     Subparagraphs 1.a \u2013 1.b: \n \nAgainst Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E:  \n \nAGAINST APPLICANT \n     Subparagraph 2.a: \n \n \nAgainst Applicant \n     Subparagraph 2.b:   \n \n \nFor Applicant \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n11 \n \n                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nConclusion \n \nIn light of the record as a whole, it is not clearly consistent with the interests of \nnational security to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified \ninformation. National security eligibility for access to classified information is denied.  \n \n                                            \n \n \n \n \nRobert Tuider \nAdministrative Judge \n \n \n \n",

He worked as a receiver in the \nDefense Reutilization Marketing Office (DRMO) yard and warehouses at the base. He \nwas one of three U.S. employees working at the DRMO site. His supervisor (S) was one \nof the other U.S. employees. DRMO is where all Army units take surplus or \nunserviceable supplies and equipment to be properly disposed of off their unit\u2019s \ninventory and accounted for by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). Items turned into \nDRMO are either destroyed or reutilized by another unit. (Tr1 41-42; Tr2 103) \nOn March 22, 2013, Applicant was contacted by members of the Army Criminal \nInvestigation Division (CID) concerning questions they had about a possible attempted \ntheft of a government generator found off the military installation on a non-authorized \nvehicle. The generator was recovered, but CID was looking into who may have been \ninvolved with the attempted theft. Applicant was sought out because he signed the DD \nForm 1348 (1348) receiving the generator into the DRMO yard for destruction. He \nadmitted signing the 1348, but did not specifically remember this one because he had \nsigned for other generators. The generator was brought to DRMO to be turned in by the \npossessing unit. The soldier who turned it in had not been through the process before \nand admitted in his sworn statement that he skipped a step and therefore the turn-in \nprocess was not actually completed. The soldier was unaware that he needed to take \nan additional step to clear the property from his unit\u2019s inventory. Applicant does not \nnormally receive property via 1348s in the yard, which is normally done by 3PN \nemployees, but he filled in doing the job when the 3PNs took their lunch breaks. S was \nalso contacted by CID because he was the overall contractor manager of DRMO. When \nS was later interviewed by CID he opined that Applicant had nothing to do with the \nattempted theft of the generator. (Tr1 45-46, 48; Tr2 31-33, 103-106) \nApplicant fully cooperated with CID by agreeing to be interviewed, preparing a \nsworn written statement, and consenting to a search of his property, including all his \nelectronic devices. He denied being involved with the attempted theft of the property or \nof conspiring to take the property. Aside from an uncorroborated reference to Applicant \nby an unidentified 3PN as a person involved with the generator and Applicant\u2019s \nsignature on the 1348, there was no evidence of his involvement with the generator. \nDespite this lack of evidence, Applicant and S were told by their contractor (K) that the \ngovernment had told K that Applicant and S were to be removed from the project and \nthe country. Applicant and S both soon left for the United States. After Applicant was \nback in the United States in April 2013, the company CEO emailed Applicant as follows: \nOn the situation [referring to the generator incident].

They received their final pay \nfrom K and did not go back to work for the company, although Applicant believed he \ncould work for K again in some other capacity if he wanted to do so. Applicant was \nnever informed when he was overseas that he was formally charged with any offense. \nWhen he was overseas in March 2013, there is no evidence that he was formally \ncharged with any crime. When he got to the United States, he was never charged with \nany criminal offense related to the generator incident. At the time he left the overseas \nlocation in approximately April 2013, he was unaware of any administrative action taken \nagainst him by any government agency. Applicant credibly testified that he was \nconfused as to the reasons why he was sent home from overseas. (Tr1 44; Tr2 31-32, \n34, 44-46, 48-50, 55, 96-97, 126; AE A) \nThe third U.S. employee (E3) who worked at the DRMO with Applicant and S, but \nwho was not investigated because he was out of the country when the generator \nincident happened, testified at the hearing. Although E3 was gone when the incident \noccurred, he was back and present when Applicant and S faced questioning by the CID. \nHe opined that Applicant would not be part of any attempted theft. He stated that the \ncommunication between K and the employees was poor and that K did not clarify with \nthe employees why Applicant and S were sent home. He noted that in discussing things \nwith Applicant before he was sent home, Applicant expressed confusion about what \nwas happening and he was not getting any answers from K. (Tr1 153-154, 156, 164) \nThe CID concluded their investigation and issued a final report on March 12, \n2014, nearly a year after the incident and after Applicant returned to the United States. \nThat report, which was redacted and excluded exhibits, is GE 3. In the report, an Army \njudge advocate opined that probable cause existed to believe that Applicant committed \nthe offenses of larceny of government property and conspiracy. There is no evidence \nthat this probable cause opinion was ever reviewed by a judge or magistrate. Applicant \nwas not informed of this opinion at this time, nor was he sent a copy of the investigation. \nHe was living in the United States at this time but had not worked for K since he left the \noverseas location. On July 15, 2014, a commander\u2019s report of disciplinary action was \ncompleted, which stated that: \n[Applicant] was subsequently fired by his employer and sent back to the \nUnited States following the termination of employment, Deputy \nCommander [redacted] signed a notice of debarment for life which covers \nall installations.  \nApplicant was not notified of this administrative action at the time it was taken.

This came to light during his job opportunity. S discovered how to \nobtain a copy of his report, which he did. S ultimately filed an appeal with the CID and \nhad his name removed as a subject.

His \noptional comment was: \u201cI was part of an investigation but I wasn\u2019t sure about being \ndebarred or not.\u201d He listed the government agency taking the debarment as \u201cCID\u201d in \n\u201c04/2013 (estimated).\u201d He then went on to explain the circumstances of the 2013 \nincident involving the generator and his lack of understanding about what happened and \nwhat impact a debarment had for him. He credibly testified that he had no intent to \nprovide false information in response to Section 13A. He believed the information he \nprovided in section 25 about his perceived debarment would be taken together with his \ninformation regarding section 13A, since they both involved the same underlying \nincident. When questioned by an investigator during his background check in August \n2019, Applicant disclosed specific details about the generator incident without being \nprompted by the investigator.

During his background interview, Applicant explained that he was first \nsuspended and ultimately fired from his courier position because he had two reported \nincidents within a one-year period. The first incident involved a missing package from \nhis truck, which he had scanned when he picked it up. The intended recipient reported \nnot receiving the package. Applicant did not know what happened to the package. This \nwas during the Christmas season in 2015, when they were very busy and it could have \nbeen delivered to a wrong address and not returned or someone could have taken the \npackage from the truck when he was out of it. He denied taking the package. He was \nwritten up for this incident as a performance issue. Less than a year later, a second \nperformance issue was documented against Applicant. In this instance, he was tasked \nwith delivering a package, which had already been attempted once, but no one was \navailable to receive it. On this second delivery attempt, Applicant did not get to it until \nthe end of the day because the package had slid in the truck and he did not see it until \nall the other packages were delivered. When he did deliver it, the recipient complained \nthat it was late and Applicant was written up for the incident. He was initially suspended \nfrom work by his employer, then terminated a day or so later because company policy \nwas that two reported incidents within one year were grounds for termination. Applicant \nreported this incident on his SCA and during his background interview. He has had no \nsimilar incidents since these. (Tr2 22-25, 111-116; GE 1, 4) \nCharacter Evidence \nApplicant also presented character testimony from his wife and several work \ncolleagues, including supervisors. His wife described Applicant as a loving, kind, \ngenerous, hard-working, honest, and good husband. Three coworkers (two supervisors) \nfrom Applicant\u2019s current employer, who are familiar with the reason Applicant is having \nthis hearing, all described him as an honest, energetic, and a trusted employee with \nwhom they have no reservations about him obtaining a security clearance.

In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law.

The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 \n2(a), the entire process is a careful weighing of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I \nhave drawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the \nevidence contained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk that an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation about potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \nAnalysis \nGuideline J, Criminal Conduct \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for criminal conduct is set out in AG \n\u00b6 30: \nCriminal activity creates doubt about a person\u2019s judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness.

The following is potentially applicable: \n(b) evidence (including, but not limited to, a credible allegation, an \nadmission, and matters of official record) of criminal conduct, regardless of \nwhether the person was formally charged, formally prosecuted or \nconvicted. \nApplicant was a suspect in the CID investigation of the attempted theft and \nconspiracy to steal a government generator in March 2013. He was never criminally \ncharged with any crime, but the administrative sanction of debarment was issued by the \nDeputy Commander of the overseas installation in July 2014. This action took place a \nyear after Applicant left the country, and he was never notified of the debarment at the \ntime the action took place and was never given an opportunity to respond to it. Applicant \nwas arrested for harassment in August 2014, but the charge was ultimately dismissed in \nDecember 2014. I find that the stated disqualifying condition minimally applies. \nI have also considered all of the mitigating conditions for criminal conduct under \nAG \u00b6 32 and considered the following relevant: \n(a) so much time has elapsed since the criminal behavior happened, or it\nhappened under such unusual circumstances that it is unlikely to recur\nand does not cast doubt on the individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, or\ngood judgment;  \n \n \n \n(c) no reliable evidence to support that the individual committed the \noffense; and \n(d) there is evidence of successful rehabilitation; including but not limited \nto the passage of time without recurrence of criminal activity, restitution, \ncompliance with the terms of parole or probation, job training or higher \neducation, \ngood \nemployment \nrecord, \nor \nconstructive \ncommunity \ninvolvement. \nThe allegation and investigation into Applicant\u2019s role into the attempted theft of \nthe overseas generator occurred over eight years ago and the dismissed harassment \ncharge occurred over seven years ago. Since then he has not had any additional \ncriminal allegations against him. AG \u00b6 32(a) applies. The evidence to support \nApplicant\u2019s involvement with the criminal conspiracy and attempted theft of the \ngenerator is insufficient. Department Counsel conceded this point in his closing \nargument by stating that the evidence does not support that Applicant was going to \nsteal or had the intent to steal the generator. Applicant was sent home by his employer, \nat the direction of the Army, as the safest and most expedient way to deal with the \nsituation. His employer, K, risked losing the contract if it did not comply with the Army\u2019s \ndirection so Applicant was sent home with little to no explanation as to why. Although \nApplicant was a named subject in the CID report, he was never criminally charged with \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nany offense by any sovereign jurisdiction. The harassment charge was dismissed. AG \u00b6 \n32(c) applies. He completed his bachelor\u2019s degree in 2019 and was hired as an \nengineer by his current employer where he is considered a trusted reliable employee \nworthy of holding a security clearance. AG \u00b6 32(d) applies. \nGuideline E, Personal Conduct \nAG \u00b6 15 expresses the personal conduct security concern: \nConduct involving questionable judgment, lack of candor, dishonesty, or \nunwillingness to comply with rules and regulations can raise questions \nabout an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to protect \nclassified or sensitive information. Of special interest is any failure to \ncooperate or provide truthful and candid answers during national security \ninvestigative or adjudicative processes. . . . \nAG \u00b6 16 describes conditions that could raise a security concern and may be \ndisqualifying in this case. The following disqualifying condition is potentially applicable: \n(a) deliberate omission, concealment, or falsification of relevant facts from \nany personnel security questionnaire, personal history statement, or \nsimilar form used to conduct investigations, determine employment \nqualifications, award benefits or status, determine national security \neligibility or trustworthiness, or award fiduciary responsibilities; \n(c) credible adverse information in several adjudicative issue areas that is \nnot sufficient for an adverse determination under any other single \nguideline, but which, when considered as a whole, supports a whole-\nperson \nassessment \nof \nquestionable \njudgment, \nuntrustworthiness, \nunreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply with rules and \nregulations, or other characteristics indicating that the individual may not \nproperly safeguard classified or sensitive information. and  \n(d) credible adverse information that is not explicitly covered under any \nother guideline and may not be sufficient by itself for an adverse \ndetermination, but which, when combined with all available information, \nsupports a whole-person assessment of questionable judgment, \nuntrustworthiness, unreliability, lack of candor, unwillingness to comply \nwith rules and regulations, or other characteristics indicating that the \nindividual may not properly safeguard classified or sensitive information. \nThis includes, but is not limited to, consideration of: \n(1) untrustworthy or unreliable behavior to include breach of \nclient confidentiality, release of proprietary information, \nunauthorized release of sensitive corporate or government \nprotected information; \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(2) any disruptive, violent, or other inappropriate behavior; \n(3) a pattern of dishonesty or rule violations; and \n(4) evidence of significant misuse of Government or other \nemployer's time or resources; \n \nAs discussed above, ASOR \u00b6 2.a was withdrawn by Department Counsel and is \nno longer at issue. ASOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c allege essentially the same conduct also \nalleged in SOR \u00b6 1.a under Guideline J. By the explicit language of both AG \u00b6\u00b6 16(c) \nand 16(d), since Guideline J is specifically applicable to the alleged conduct, those AGs \ndo not apply to ASOR \u00b6\u00b6 2.b and 2.c. However, if they did apply, Applicant\u2019s conduct \nwould be mitigated for the same reasons stated under the Guideline J discussion above \nand by the application of AGs \u00b6\u00b6 17(c) and 17(f). The circumstances leading to the \ninvestigation of Applicant were unique and unlikely to recur and they do not cast doubt \non his current reliability, trustworthiness and good judgment. Additionally, the \ninformation from the CID investigation, as a whole, was unsubstantiated or from a \nsource of questionable reliability. \nASOR \u00b6 2.d is mitigated because this allegation is more about Applicant\u2019s \nperformance at a previous job than it is about misconduct. Additionally, this occurred \nover seven years ago and there is no evidence of more recent similar action by \nApplicant. His character evidence supports that he is reliable, trustworthy, and shows \ngood judgment. AG \u00b6 17(c) applies. \nThe developed facts do not support the allegation that Applicant deliberately\nfalsified his 2019 SCA when he listed his reason for leaving the employ of K as \u201ccontract \nended.\u201d First, if his entire SCA answers are considered, then he provided sufficient \ninformation about the overseas generator incident when you also consider his answers\nto Section 25 about government debarments to allow further investigation if deemed \nnecessary. Second, there is no evidence that Applicant ever received any written notice\nof misconduct from his employer, K, related to the events of March 2013. While he\neventually received a copy of the CID investigation in 2016 and 2020, he admitted being \nconfused by the information and not understanding what some of it meant, specifically \nwhat a debarment was. This lack of understanding undercuts the argument that he\ndeliberately gave false information in response to the SCA question. Finally, in \nanswering other areas of the SCA, Applicant was quite candid in disclosing a prior \nminor conviction (SOR \u00b6 1.b) and a prior employment termination (ASOR \u00b6 2.d). His\nwillingness to disclose these unfavorable incidents, undercuts the idea that he would\ndeliberately falsify information related to Section 13A.

The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a security \nclearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nthe facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I considered the evidence of \nApplicant\u2019s good character, and his successful completion of his bachelor\u2019s degree. The \ncriminal conduct security concerns are mitigated and personal conduct security \nconcerns were either not established or were mitigated. \nOverall the record evidence leaves me without questions or doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant mitigated all the security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline J:  \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs      1.a \u2013 1.b: \n \nFor Applicant \nParagraph 2, Guideline E: \nFOR APPLICANT \nSubparagraph        2.a: \nWithdrawn \nSubparagraphs      2.b - .2.e: \nFor Applicant \n11 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________ \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Applicant attended college courses from 2004 through 2016, but he did not obtain a degree. He reports no military service. He completed a security clearance application on May 6, 2019. He has worked for his sponsoring employer since September 2018. (Item 3) Financial The SOR alleges that Applicant allegedly failed to timely file, as required, his Federal income tax returns for tax years 2013 through 2018 (1.a); and he failed to file, as required, a state income tax return for the tax years 2013 through 2018 (1.b). The SOR also alleges that Applicant is indebted for past-due student loan accounts in the approximate amount of $3,000 (1.c through 1.g). The allegations are supported by his credit reports and security clearance application. (Item 3) Applicant attributes his delinquent debts to a number of things: poor financial decisions; unemployment for a year (2017-2018); failure to file tax returns out of neglect and irresponsibility; and becoming frustrated with the tax process because he could not deduct mortgage interest as his name was not listed as the primary mortgagor where he lived.

The action was taken under Executive Order (Exec.

The Government\u2019s evidence, included in the FORM and identified as \nItems 1 through 7, is admitted without objection. The case was assigned to me on \nAugust 19, 2021. Based on my review of the documentary evidence, I find that \nApplicant has not mitigated financial considerations security concerns. \nFindings of Fact \nIn response to the SOR, Applicant admitted SOR allegations 1.a through 1.g with \nexplanations. (Item 2) He is 44 years old, and married with one child. Applicant attended \ncollege courses from 2004 through 2016, but he did not obtain a degree. He reports no \nmilitary service. He completed a security clearance application on May 6, 2019. He has \nworked for his sponsoring employer since September 2018. (Item 3) \nFinancial \nThe SOR alleges that Applicant allegedly failed to timely file, as required, his \nFederal income tax returns for tax years 2013 through 2018 (1.a); and he failed to file, \nas required, a state income tax return for the tax years 2013 through 2018 (1.b). The \nSOR also alleges that Applicant is indebted for past-due student loan accounts in the \napproximate amount of $3,000 (1.c through 1.g). The allegations are supported by his \ncredit reports and security clearance application. (Item 3) \nApplicant attributes his delinquent debts to a number of things: poor financial \ndecisions; unemployment for a year (2017-2018); failure to file tax returns out of neglect \nand irresponsibility; and becoming frustrated with the tax process because he could not \ndeduct mortgage interest as his name was not listed as the primary mortgagor where he \nlived. He stopped filing his income tax returns. He did not move from the residence until \n2016. (Item 3) \nIn his answer to the SOR, Applicant stated that he lived as \u201ca beach bum\u201d for \nroughly 15 years which led to poor financial decisions. (Item 2) He states that the only \nbills he has now are the student loans and some credit card debt. His admission as to \nSOR allegations 1.a to 1.b are identical in that he failed to timely file, as required, his \nFederal and state income tax returns from 2013 through 2018. However, he states that \nhe \u201chad received a small refund in previous years and so did not think it important.\u201d \nApplicant added that he did not receive credit for the mortgage interest on the condo he \nshared, and he lived there until 2016. (Item 2) \nAs to SORs 1.c through 1.g, concerning the student loans, Applicant provided \nbasically the same answers. He admitted that he failed to make timely payments to the \nloan service on several occasions because he was negotiating with the loan provider for  \nsome time to get his payment down to a more reasonable amount. (Item 2) He added \nthat currently his loan is in deferment due to COVID. He fully expects to pay about $250 \na month when things move forward. At his 2019 interview, he denied that he had any \ndelinquent accounts. (Item 3) After being confronted by the investigator with his student \nloan delinquent debts, he admitted that he had delinquent student loans.

(Item 4) Applicant\u2019s loans are now deferred \ndue to COVID. He knew at the conclusion of his 2015 college coursework that he was \nrequired to begin paying on his student loans. He did not set up a payment plan until \n2018. He then stopped in 2019 in hopes of forcing better terms out of the lender. (Item \n4) He has not described how he will deal with the student loans when they are no longer \ndeferred due to COVID, except that he would start paying $250 a month. \nIn Applicant\u2019s 2019 investigative interview, he admitted that it was not a priority to \nfile his taxes. He again stated that he did not believe that it was a priority. (Item 5) He \nnoted that he became frustrated with the tax process, because he was paying the \nmortgage on his condo, but he was not listed as the primary mortgagor, and he did not \nreceive the tax benefit. (Item 5) At the time he was completing his security paperwork \nfor his current position as a defense contractor, he realized the importance of filing his \ntaxes. Subsequently, he met with a tax analyst who advised him to file the Federal and \nstate tax returns for the past three years. (Item 5) He is in the process of locating the \nnecessary tax documents to begin the filing process. He again admitted to his \nnegligence in failing to file his tax returns and is working toward rectifying the situation. \n(Item 5) At the time of his 2019 interview, none of his tax returns from 2013 to present \nwere filed. \nApplicant has not received any information from the IRS regarding his lack of \nfiling. As of the interview, Applicant had not filed any of the tax returns for the tax years \nin question. However, he does not dispute his responsibility to file for Federal and state \ntax returns on time. He again admits to his negligence in failing to file his tax returns. \n(Item 5) He did not provide any information concerning the tax issues. \nIn his March 2020 interrogatory, Applicant listed that he had filed all of his \nFederal and state tax returns in January and February 2020. (Item 4) The filings took \nplace just days before his interrogatory response. Applicant provided no documentation \nfrom his own records or copies of what was submitted in support of his assertion. \nHowever, he stated that he had no tax liability. He did submit tax transcripts for 2016\u00ad\n2018 that show a zero balance. (Item 4) He also believes that his tax returns for tax \nyears 2013-2015 have been filed, but he does not have them. (Item 2) \nApplicant stated that he is a homeowner, and he has about $150,000 in equity. \nHe noted that he had other assets, such as cars, motorcycles, and a retirement \naccount. He has under $500 in credit card debt. He provided no budget and has not \nsought financial counseling. (Item 2) \nApplicant had substantial savings and he admits that he did not start to address \nhis Federal or state taxes until after he received the SOR. He has not received financial \ncounseling. (Item 4) At the interview, Applicant was given an opportunity to submit \ndocumentation regarding the financial delinquencies. He failed to provide any \ndocumentation or dispute information.

There is no information in the record \nconcerning his salary, use of a financial counselor, budget or income. Applicant \nprovided no documentation to support a specific plan for resolving his financial issues. \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are to be used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in \nconjunction with the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(a), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables \nknown as the \u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all \navailable, reliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and \nunfavorable, in making a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, the applicant is \nresponsible for presenting \u201cwitnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, \nor mitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel.\u201d The \napplicant has the ultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision. \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This \nrelationship transcends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The \nGovernment reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it \ngrants access to classified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of \nthe possible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard \nclassified information. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible \nextrapolation of potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified \ninformation. \nSection 7 of Exec.

Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds . . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that a person might knowingly \ncompromise classified information to raise money. It encompasses concerns about a \nperson\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting classified \ninformation. A person who is financially irresponsible may also be irresponsible, \nunconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified information. See \nISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, establish three \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d), \n19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d); and 19 (f) \u201cfailure to file \u2026. \nannual Federal, state, or local income tax as required\u201d). \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by the following \npotentially applicable factors: \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances.

He blames the debts on various things. He provided no information to support \nany actions that he has taken to resolve any of his SOR delinquent debts. He has \nreceived no financial counseling. He has not provided any documentation that supports \nany of the mitigating conditions. He receives partial mitigation for a condition beyond his \ncontrol due to unemployment, but he did not act responsibly when he became \nemployed. \nAs to the tax issues, Applicant partially admits and partially denies that he failed \nto timely file his income tax returns. If he did file the Federal and income tax returns, it \nwas not until 2020. \nBased on the lack of evidence produced by Applicant, it is difficult to conclude he \nmade a sufficient good-faith effort to resolve his debts, tax issues or that his financial \nsituation is under control. Despite gainful employment since 2018, there is no evidence \nthat Applicant has a meaningful track record of financial responsibility in this case. He \nhas not met his burden and none of the mitigating conditions apply. Any doubts must be \nresolved in favor of the Government. \nWhole-Person Concept \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case.

He denied; however, that this case presents a credible Guideline B concern. Applicant\u2019s SOR admissions and those at his hearing are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a thorough review of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: Applicant, 41, was born and raised in Albania.

He has shared custody of his U.S.-born daughter from a prior relationship. \nHis wife is applying for U.S. citizenship, and they have a son born in the United States. \nOn balance, because of his deep and longstanding relationships and loyalties in and to \nthe United States, he can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. Foreign influence security concerns are mitigated. Eligibility for access to \nclassified information is granted. \nStatement of the Case \nApplicant submitted a security clearance application (SCA) on December 8, 2017, \nseeking clearance eligibility required for a position with a federal contractor. After \nreviewing the information gathered during the background investigation, the Defense \nCounterintelligence and Security Agency Consolidated Adjudications Facility (CAF) \nissued a Statement of Reasons (SOR) on March 6, 2020, alleging security concerns \nunder Guideline B (foreign influence). Applicant answered the SOR on March 23, 2020, \nand requested a hearing before an administrative judge. \n1 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe case was assigned to me on November 2, 2020. On November 6, 2020, the \nDefense Office of Hearings and Appeals (DOHA) notified Applicant that the hearing was \nscheduled for December 1, 2020. I convened the hearing as scheduled. \nGovernment exhibit (GE) 1 and Applicant exhibits (AE) A through K, were admitted \nin evidence without objections. GE 2 for identification (Government\u2019s Request for \nAdministrative Notice concerning The Kingdom of Thailand (Thailand)) and AE L for \nidentification (Applicant\u2019s Motion for Administrative Notice concerning Thailand) were \nmarked and made part of the record, but not admitted as evidence. DOHA received the \ntranscript (Tr.) on December 14, 2020. \nProcedural Issue \nBoth Department Counsel and Applicant requested that I take administrative notice \nof facts concerning Thailand, its internal and external affairs, and its relations with the \nUnited States, to determine whether foreign influence security concerns are raised by \nApplicant\u2019s connections to Thailand. (GE 2 and AE L) Applicant\u2019s counsel objected to the \nprobative value of GE 2. His objection was overruled. Department Counsel did not object \nto AE L. \nIn Guideline B cases, I am required to consider, among other things, the nature of \na nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and its human rights record \nto assess the likelihood that an applicant or his family members are vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion. The facts administratively noticed are set out in the source documents and \nsummarized in both parties\u2019 written requests and will not be repeated verbatim in this \ndecision. (GE 2 and AE L) \nOf particular note are that Thailand is a long-time military allied and economic \npartner of the United States. Two recent military coups have complicated Thai-U.S. \nrelations and Thailand\u2019s perception as a model democracy. Thailand's increasing \neconomic, military, and diplomatic ties to China are a concern to the United States. \nSignificant human rights abuses continue without punishment for those involved. Terrorist \nincidents attributed to ethno-nationalistic insurgents have occurred in Thailand\u2019s southern \nregion. \nFindings of Fact \nApplicant admitted the three SOR allegations: \u00b6 1.a (that his wife is a citizen of \nThailand); and \u00b6\u00b6 1.b and 1.c (that her parents are citizen-residents of Thailand). He \ndenied; however, that this case presents a credible Guideline B concern. Applicant\u2019s SOR \nadmissions and those at his hearing are incorporated herein as findings of fact. After a \nthorough review of the record evidence, I make the following additional findings of fact: \nApplicant, 41, was born and raised in Albania. He immigrated to the United States \nin November 1999, at age 20, and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in November 2006. \nHis parents also immigrated to the United States and became naturalized U.S. citizens. \n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nHis father passed away, but his mother resides in the United States.

He received an associate\u2019s degree in 2013, and a bachelor\u2019s degree in 2015, \nboth from U.S. academic institutions. He worked while attending college to pay for his \neducation, and at some point, opened his own business. After receiving his bachelor\u2019s \ndegree in 2015, he started working for his current employer and clearance sponsor, a \nfederal contractor. (GE 1, Tr. 43-44, 85) \nApplicant has done well in his position, and has been promoted several times. He \nis the team lead developer for an important project, and has received commendations \nfrom his employer and clients for his excellent performance. He is currently a senior data \nanalyst and supervises two other employees. He is scheduled to become a manager in \nthe near future. \nApplicant married his first wife in 2003, and divorced in 2008. She was a \nnaturalized U.S. citizen born in Vietnam. He married his second wife, a Thai citizen, in \n2008 and divorced in 2012. He sponsored his second wife to become a naturalized U.S. \ncitizen. (Tr. 115) He has a 13-year-old daughter, born in the United States, of this \nrelationship. He shares custody of his daughter with his ex-wife. \nApplicant\u2019s wife was born in Thailand and has been in the United States since \n2007, under a student visa. They met in 2013 and married in 2015. She has applied for \nnaturalization as a U.S. citizen and is pending an interview that is scheduled for March \n2021. She completed two master\u2019s degrees in the United States and is in the process of \ncompleting her doctorate degree. \nAt the time Applicant submitted his 2017 SCA, his spouse was working as an \nindependent contractor at the Thai embassy. After becoming aware of the security \nconcerns raised by her employment, his wife resigned her position at the Thai embassy \nand is currently unemployed. She is dedicating her time to raising their son and finishing \nher doctorate degree. (Tr. 36) \nApplicant visited the Thai embassy several times during public functions. He also \nmet with his wife\u2019s colleagues at the embassy for social functions and at restaurants. They \nhave had no contact with any Thai embassy personnel after she resigned her position. \nApplicant\u2019s parents-in-law are citizens and residents of Thailand. He is 77 years \nold and she is 68 years old. His father-in-law worked for the Thai Ministry of Commerce. \nHe retired from his job about 14 years ago and receives a government pension. In his \n2017 SCA, Applicant claimed to have contact with his father-in-law quarterly and monthly \nwith his mother-in-law. He does not speak Thai, and his communication with his in-laws \nis exclusively through his wife. Applicant\u2019s brother-in-law is in the United States under a \nstudent visa. He completed a master\u2019s degree in a U.S. university and his current \nemployer is sponsoring his permanent resident application.

They \nhave travelled frequently (yearly or every other year) to the United States for family events \nsuch as his wedding, his brother-in-law\u2019s college graduation, his son\u2019s birth, and for \nregular family visits. \nApplicant repeatedly testified that he cannot be successfully blackmailed because \nhe would never agree to it. He noted that if he were to give away anything, no matter how \nsmall, that would be a source of blackmail in the future, and it would jeopardize everything \nthat he has worked for so hard in the United States. He promised to immediately report \nany blackmail attempt or request for information, including from his wife, to his facility's \nsecurity officer and the FBI. \nApplicant described his immigration to the United States as a dream come true. \nHis parents were some of the first Albanians to receive a visa to travel to the United \nStates. They told Applicant about the freedom and opportunities that the United States \noffers, and it became part of his dream to come to the United States. He wanted to come \nto the United States to have a better life and to obtain the opportunities that he was not \nable to have in Albania. \nSince the first time that he arrived in the United States, Applicant\u2019s dream was to \nbe an American and to be a U.S. citizen. He believes that the United States is a country \nof opportunities, where all your dreams can be accomplished if you work hard, follow the \nlaw, and obey all the rules. He believes that he has been able to make his dreams come \ntrue. He is proud of the success he has achieved in the United States. \nApplicant strongly believes that there are no opportunities for him or his wife in \nThailand. Once she gets her Ph.D., her career and opportunities will be so much better \nin the United States. They have never thought about or even considered the possibility of \nher going back to Thailand. Her dream job is to someday work for NASA. She shares his \ndream of becoming a U.S. citizen. \nApplicant and his wife visited Thailand twice before 2017. After Applicant submitted \nhis 2017 SCA, he and his wife visited Thailand twice. (Tr. 101-102) He does not intend to \ntravel to Thailand ever again. He noted that his in-laws have 10-year U.S. travel visas. \nHe anticipates that they will travel to the United States to see his wife and their grandchild. \nAll of Applicant\u2019s and his wife\u2019s property and financial assets are in the United \nStates, including his salary, savings, retirement accounts, and a home. He has no \nfinancial or property interests in any foreign country. At the time he completed his 2017 \nSCA, Applicant had an investment property. When his wife quit her job at the Thai \nembassy, Applicant sold the investment property to avoid any possible financial issues \nresulting from their reduced income. (Tr. 99) \nApplicant presented the testimony of two witnesses.

Or. 10865, \nSafeguarding Classified Information within Industry \u00a7 2 (Feb. 20, 1960), as amended. The\nU.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive Branch in\nregulating access to information pertaining to national security, emphasizing that \u201cno one\nhas a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 528\n(1988). \n \n \n \n \nThe AG list disqualifying and mitigating conditions for evaluating a person\u2019s \nsuitability for access to classified information. Any one disqualifying or mitigating condition \nis not, by itself, conclusive. However, the AG should be followed where a case can be \nmeasured against them, as they represent policy guidance governing access to classified \ninformation. Each decision must reflect a fair, impartial, and commonsense consideration \nof the whole person and the factors listed in SEAD 4, App. A \u00b6\u00b6 2(d) and 2(f). All available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, must \nbe considered. \nSecurity clearance decisions resolve whether it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue an applicant\u2019s security clearance. The Government \nmust prove, by substantial evidence, controverted facts alleged in the SOR. If it does, the \nburden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the facts. The \napplicant bears the heavy burden of demonstrating that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to grant or continue his or her security clearance. \nPersons with access to classified information enter into a fiduciary relationship with \nthe Government based on trust and confidence. Thus, the Government has a compelling \ninterest in ensuring each applicant possesses the requisite judgment, reliability, and \ntrustworthiness of those who must protect national interest as their own.

Clearance decisions are not \na determination of the loyalty of the applicant concerned. They are merely an indication \nthat the applicant has or has not met the strict guidelines the Government has established \nfor issuing a clearance. \nAnalysis \nGuideline B, Foreign Influence  \nThe security concern for foreign influence is set out in AG \u00b6 6: \nForeign contacts and interests, including, but not limited to, business, \nfinancial, and property interests, are a national security concern if they result \nin divided allegiance. They may also be a national security concern if they \ncreate circumstances in which the individual may be manipulated or induced \nto help a foreign person, group, organization, or government in a way \ninconsistent with U.S. interests or otherwise made vulnerable to pressure \nor coercion by any foreign interest. Assessment of foreign contacts and \ninterests should consider the country in which the foreign contact or interest \nis located, including, but not limited to, considerations such as whether it is \nknown to target U.S. citizens to obtain classified or sensitive information or \nis associated with a risk of terrorism. \nApplicant\u2019s wife is a citizen of Thailand and her parents are citizen-residents of \nThailand. Directly or through his wife, Applicant maintains a close relationship with his \nspouse and her relatives in Thailand as demonstrated by his and her family\u2019s frequent \ncontacts and communications with them. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 7. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n(a) contact, regardless of method, with a foreign family member, business \nor professional associate, friend, or other person who is a citizen of or \nresident in a foreign country if that contact creates a heightened risk of \nforeign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, or coercion; and \n(b) connections to a foreign person, group, government, or country that \ncreate a potential conflict of interest between the individual's obligation to \nprotect classified or sensitive information or technology and the individual\u2019s \ndesire to help a foreign person, group, or country by providing that \ninformation or technology.  \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to coercion from foreign governments or other entities. The risk \nof coercion, persuasion, or duress is significantly greater if the foreign country has an \nauthoritarian government, a family member is associated with or dependent upon the \ngovernment, the country is known to conduct intelligence operations against the United \nStates, or the foreign country is associated with a risk of terrorism. \nThere is evidence of a threat of domestic terror, sectarian violence, criminal \nactivity, and ongoing human rights problems in Thailand. Additionally, Thailand's \nincreasing economic, military, and diplomatic ties to China are a concern to the United \nStates. Applicant\u2019s foreign contacts may create a potential conflict of interest, and there \nis evidence of a risk of foreign exploitation, inducement, manipulation, pressure, and \ncoercion. The evidence of Applicant\u2019s connections to his wife and in-laws, and their \nconnections to Thailand are sufficient to establish disqualifying conditions AG \u00b6\u00b6 7(a) and \n7(b). \nConditions that could mitigate foreign influence security concerns are provided \nunder AG \u00b6 8. The following are potentially applicable: \n(a) the nature of the relationships with foreign persons, the country in which \nthese persons are located, or the positions or activities of those persons in \nthat country are such that it is unlikely the individual will be placed in a \nposition of having to choose between the interests of a foreign individual, \ngroup, organization, or government and the interests of the United States; \nand  \n(b) there is no conflict of interest, either because the individual\u2019s sense of \nloyalty or obligation to the foreign person, or allegiance to the group, \ngovernment, or country is so minimal, or the individual has such deep and \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States, that the \nindividual can be expected to resolve any conflict of interest in favor of the \nU.S. interest. \nI considered the totality of Applicant and his wife\u2019s family ties to Thailand. Thailand \nis generally regarded in the United States as a friendly country. However, Guideline B is \nnot limited to countries hostile to the United States. \u201cThe United States has a compelling \ninterest in protecting and safeguarding classified information from any person, \norganization, or country that is not authorized to have access to it, regardless of whether \nthat person, organization, or country has interests inimical to those of the United States.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 02-11570 at 5 (App. Bd. May 19, 2004). \nThe distinctions between friendly and unfriendly governments must be made with \ncaution. Relations between nations can shift, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly. \nFurthermore, friendly nations can have profound disagreements with the United States \nover matters they view as important to their vital interests or national security. Finally, we \n7 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe nature of a nation\u2019s government, its relationship with the United States, and \nits human rights record are relevant in assessing the likelihood that an applicant\u2019s family \nmembers are vulnerable to government coercion. The two recent military coups have \ncomplicated Thai-U.S. relations and the United States\u2019 perception of Thailand as a \ndemocracy. I also considered that Thailand's increasing economic, military, and \ndiplomatic ties to China are a concern to the United States; that Thailand has significant \nhuman rights abuses that continue without punishment for those involved; and that \nterrorist incidents attributed to ethno-nationalistic insurgents have occurred in Thailand\u2019s \nsouthern region. \n \n \nThere is no evidence to show that the government of Thailand supports terrorism, \nthat it conducts intelligence operations against the United States, or that it has a policy or \na practice of putting pressure on its citizens to, in turn, pressure relatives in the United \nStates. The Government has no obligation to present such evidence, and this observation \nis made to complete the record and not to shift the evidentiary burden to the Government. \nNotwithstanding, because of his relatives and their property and financial interests in \nThailand, Applicant could be placed in a position of having to choose between the \ninterests of a family member and the interests of the United States.  \n \n \nApplicant immigrated in 1999 and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2006. His \nparents followed him into the United States and also became naturalized U.S. citizens. \nHe attended college in the United States and has established himself firmly as a solid \nAmerican citizen. He is respected at work for his performance, trustworthiness, and \nreliability. He has been promoted several times, and is pending a promotion to a manager \nposition. All of Applicant\u2019s financial and property interests (his home, bank accounts, \nsavings, and retirement accounts) are in the United States. He shares custody of \n \n his 13-\nyear-old daughter, born in the United States, with his ex-wife. Additionally, Applicant is \ninvolved in his community. He mentors high school students and volunteers for nonprofit \norganizations and other honorable causes.  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nknow friendly nations have engaged in espionage against the United States, especially in \nthe economic, scientific, and technical fields. \nApplicant\u2019s wife immigrated to the United States in 2007. She completed two \nmaster\u2019s degrees and is pending completion of a doctorate degree, all in U.S. institutions. \nThey married in 2015 and they have a two-year-old son born in the United States. She \nsubmitted an application for naturalization that is pending adjudication. (AE J) Applicant\u2019s \nwife resigned her clerical position at the Thai embassy when she became aware of the \nconcerns it caused for Applicant\u2019s clearance eligibility. \nI considered that Applicant\u2019s in-laws have a property in Thailand. Applicant\u2019s wife \nand her brother\u2019s interests in that property would not accrue until her parent\u2019s passing. \nThus, at this point, her interest in the property is speculative and likely she would be \nentitled to only a percentage of the value of the property. According to his testimony, the \nproperty would likely be inherited by his wife\u2019s brother, who is currently a resident in the \nUnited States. If she inherits any property in Thailand, his wife intends to sell it and bring \n8 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n    \n \n \n \nthe profits to the United States. I believe that Applicant\u2019s wife\u2019s interest in the Thai property \nis unlikely to result in a conflict of interest that could be used effectively to influence, \nmanipulate, or pressure him or his wife. \nMost of the Applicant\u2019s immediate family members are currently living in the United \nStates (except for a sibling in Albania and his in-laws in Thailand). He credibly testified \nthat his loyalty is only to the United States, he is not interested in visiting Thailand ever \nagain, and he would promptly report any efforts by anyone to obtain any classified \ninformation from him, even if it was his wife. \nOn balance, I find that Applicant submitted sufficient evidence of his ties to the \nUnited States. There is no conflict of interest because Applicant has established \nlongstanding relationships and loyalties in the United States. He can be expected to \nresolve any possible conflict of interest in favor of the U.S. interest. His most important \nfamily interests all reside in the United States. AG \u00b6\u00b6 8(a) and 8(b) are established. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether the granting or continuing \nof national security eligibility is clearly consistent with the interests of national security \nmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of the \nguidelines, each of which is to be evaluated in the context of the whole person. An \nadministrative judge should consider the nine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 \n2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nI have incorporated my comments under the guideline at issue in my whole-person \nanalysis, and I have considered the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d). After weighing the disqualifying \nand mitigating conditions under these guidelines, and evaluating all the evidence in the \ncontext of the whole person, Applicant has mitigated the security concerns. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are:      \n9 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n  \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________ \nParagraph 1, Guideline B:   \n \n \n \n \nFor APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a through 1.c:  \n \n \n \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is clearly \nconsistent with the national security interest of the United States to grant Applicant\u2019s \neligibility for a security clearance.

This allegation is unresolved. \n(SOR \u00b6 1.d) Applicant failed to timely file her 2016 and 2017 state income tax \nreturns. In her Answer, she said she intended to file her 2017 returns in October 2020. \n(Item 2) She did not submit proof that she filed either of these state returns. This allegation \nis unresolved. \nApplicant attributed her financial problems to marital problems with her husband \nwho was spending her money carelessly. She said she was trying to stabilize her finances \nand pay her debts. She and her husband sold their townhouse to help address their debts. \nShe stated that she filed all outstanding tax returns, but did not submit proof for any of \nthe returns. (Items 2; Ex. 1) \nApplicant submitted a 2020 performance evaluation. She received an overall \u201cHigh \nPerformance\u201d rating. (Ex. 3) Her employer noted that she is competent, reliable and an \nexceptional employee. (Ex. 3) \nPolicies \nThis case is adjudicated under Executive Order (EO) 10865, Safeguarding \nClassified Information within Industry (February 20, 1960), as amended; DOD Directive \n5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security Clearance Review Program (January 2, \n1992), as amended (Directive); and the adjudicative guidelines (AG), which became \neffective on June 8, 2017. \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for national security eligibility, the \nadministrative judge must consider the AG. In addition to brief introductory explanations \nfor each guideline, the AG list potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions, which \nare useful in evaluating an applicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in AG \u00b6 2 describing the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According \nto AG \u00b6 2(c), the entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known \nas the whole-person concept. The administrative judge must consider all available, \nreliable information about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in \nmaking a decision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \n3 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. Likewise, I have avoided drawing inferences grounded on mere \nspeculation or conjecture. \nDirective \u00b6 E3.1.14 requires the Government to present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15 states that an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by the applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable clearance decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthe applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to protect or safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as \nto potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of Executive Order 10865 provides that an adverse decision shall be \u201cin \nterms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of \nthe applicant concerned.\u201d See also Executive Order 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple \nprerequisites for access to classified or sensitive information.) \nAnalysis \nGuideline F: Financial Considerations \nThe security concerns relating to the guideline for financial considerations are set \nout in AG & 18: \nFailure or inability to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet \nfinancial obligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness and ability to \nprotect classified information. Financial distress can also be caused by or \nexacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other issues of \npersonnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental health \nconditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal acts to generate funds. \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \nAG \u00b6 19 sets out disqualifying conditions that could potentially raise security \nconcerns. The following are potentially applicable in this case:  \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations; and \n(f) failure to file or fraudulently filing annual Federal, state, or local income \ntax returns or failure to pay annual Federal, state, or local income tax as \nrequired. \nApplicant has a history of not meeting financial obligations, particularly her student \nloans, as documented by a previous security clearance case involving the same issue. \nShe also failed to timely file her 2016 and 2017 Federal and state income tax returns. \nThe evidence is sufficient to raise the above disqualifying conditions. \nAfter the Government produced substantial evidence of disqualifying conditions, \nthe burden shifted to Applicant to produce evidence and prove mitigation of the security \nconcerns. AG \u00b6 20 sets out five conditions that could potentially mitigate financial security \nconcerns in this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances;  \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(g) the individual has made arrangements with the appropriate tax authority \nto file or pay the amount owed and is in compliance with those \narrangements. \nApplicant has a history of student loan and tax problems that is ongoing and casts \ndoubt on her reliability and good judgement. There is insufficient evidence to establish \nmitigation under AG \u00b6 20(a). Applicant attributed her financial problems to her husband\u2019s \nirresponsible use of her money. While that may have been a circumstance beyond her \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \ncontrol, she did not provide sufficient evidence that she acted responsibly in addressing \nher financial obligations. She failed to establish mitigation under AG \u00b6 20(b). \nThere is no evidence that Applicant received credit counseling or that her finances, \nstudent loans, or taxes are under control. She did not submit evidence to document her \ncompliance with the current settlement arrangement she asserted she has with her \nstudent loan creditor. She did not demonstrate a good-faith effort to manage those \nstudent loans given their age and her past security clearance issues related to them in \n2007. She did not provide credible proof that she filed all outstanding tax returns. She did \nnot establish mitigation under AG \u00b6\u00b6 20 (c), (d), or (g). \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) extent to which \nparticipation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation and \nother permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; (8) \nthe potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nAG \u00b6 2(c) requires the ultimate determination of whether to grant national security \neligibility include an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration of \nthe guidelines and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nfacts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 51-year-old woman, who served in the Army for 20 years and has \nsuccessfully worked for a defense contractor since 1987. Her employer gave her a high \nrating for 2020. Nonetheless, her delinquent student loans have raised security concerns \nfor the second time. Despite telling an investigator in January 2019 that she intended to \nfile her 2016 and 2017 tax returns with her 2018 returns in March 2019, there is insufficient \nevidence to conclude that she has done so. At this time, the status of her 2016 through \n2020 returns is unknown. There is no information to show that she does not owe Federal \nor state taxes related to those returns. The record evidence leaves me with serious doubts \nabout Applicant\u2019s judgment, reliability, and suitability for a security clearance.

She previously held a security \nclearance and has never had a security violation. (Tr. 6, 19-23, 31-32 GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged eight collection accounts and one charged-off debt (medical \ndebts, apartment rent debts, utility debts, a car repossession, and consumer debts) \ntotaling approximately $23,088. The debts are established by credit reports from August \n2018, May 2019, and December 2019; Applicant\u2019s personal subject interview (PSI) with \na defense investigator in August 2018; and her SOR admissions. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 11p) (GE \n2-5; Answer to SOR) \n \nApplicant explained that her financial issues began when she was a single mother \nand she was involved in an abusive relationship which caused her to have to vacate her \napartment before the end of her lease term. Her periods of unemployment also \ncontributed to her financial problems. Her husband lost his job in 2020 due to the \npandemic, which also contributed to their financial distress. She admitted that she was \nalso foolish with her finances and did not understand how delinquent debts could impact \nher job. She hired a debt repair company (DRC) to clean up her credit report. She stated \nthat the DRC did not assist with paying her debts, but it did help repair her credit report \nand it offered her some strategies on how to address her delinquent debts.

He described Applicant as a trustworthy and ethical professional. He recommends \nher for a security clearance. (AE B) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG & 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG & 19 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred nine delinquent debts, five of which remain unpaid or \nunresolved. I find all the above disqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n    \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent and, although she produced documentation of \npayment for three debts, she failed to produce supporting documentation that she has \naddressed the remainder of her debts. She failed to produce evidence showing that \nrecurrence of her financial problems is unlikely. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not applicable. \nApplicant\u2019s unemployment periods and her husband\u2019s unemployment were \ncircumstances beyond her control. In approximately 2013, she was the victim of domestic \nviolence, which impacted her renter status and was also beyond her control. However, \nshe did not act responsibly when she failed to engage five creditors in attempts to resolve \nthose debts. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not applicable. \nApplicant did not present evidence of financial counseling, although she hired a \nDRC to clean up her credit report. Her track record to date does not support a good \nfinancial picture. Additionally, although she addressed four debts, she failed to put forth \na good-faith effort to resolve the rest of her debts. Applicant\u2019s financial problems are not \nunder control. AG \u00b6\u00b6 20(c) and AG 20(d) do not apply. Applicant successfully disputed \nSOR \u00b6 1.c as a duplicate debt. AG \u00b6 20(e) applies. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s unemployment periods, her domestic violence situation, \nand the circumstances surrounding her indebtedness. However, I also considered that \nshe has made insufficient efforts to resolve her debts, particularly the larger ones. She \nhas not established a meaningful track record of debt management, which causes me to \nquestion her ability to resolve her debts. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts about \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I \nconclude Applicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. (I \nconsidered the exceptions under Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Appendix \nC, dated June 8, 2017, and determined they are not applicable in this case.) \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph:   1.a: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph:   1.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph:   1.c: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph:   1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph:   1.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraph:   1.f:  \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph:   1.g: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs: 1.h-1.i: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

His \nadmissions are adopted as findings of fact. After a review of the pleadings and evidence, \nI make the following additional findings of fact. \nApplicant is a 31-year-old employee of a federal contractor performing the duties \nof a systems engineer. He began working at his present job in December 2018. He \nreceived his bachelor\u2019s degree in 2017. He is single with no children. He lives with his \ngirlfriend to whom he pays monthly rent of $500. (Tr. 6-7, 17-18, 28; GE 1) \nThe SOR alleged 11 delinquent accounts (a federal recoupment debt and medical \ndebts) totaling approximately $27,900. The debts are established by credit reports from \nApril 2019, November 2019, and February 2021; admissions in his March 2019 security \nclearance application (SCA); Applicant\u2019s personal subject interview (PSI) with a defense \ninvestigator in August 2019; and his SOR admissions. (SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a \u2013 1.k) (GE 1-5; \nAnswer to SOR) \nApplicant\u2019s financial difficulties began in approximately 2011 when he dis-enrolled \nfrom a university where he had accepted an ROTC scholarship. He attended for \napproximately two years, long enough to garner a recoupment obligation for his \nscholarship money, when he quit because the program was not right for him. Upon \nquitting, he incurred a financial obligation to the federal government of approximately \n$24,000. Applicant claims he made some payments on the debt early on, but because of \nlow paying jobs and continuing his college education on his own, he could not keep up \nwith the payments and they became delinquent. (Tr. 20-21; GE 1-2)    \nApplicant dealt with two medical issues involving a collapsed lung, first in 2017 and \nagain in 2018. He was not covered by health insurance for these incidents, and he and \nhis mother tried to handle the resulting medical bills. Some of the SOR-related medical \ndebts are derived from these events. (Tr. 35-36, 38; GE 2) \nThe status of the SOR debts is as follows: \nSOR \u00b6 1.a-$15,338. This debt resulted from Applicant\u2019s recoupment obligation to \nthe federal government for his ROTC scholarship. In his SCA, Applicant claims the \nbalance on this debt started at approximately $24,000, but his earliest credit report puts \nthe initial balance at approximately $20,000 in 2014.

(Tr. 39-42, 45, 47, 49; AE A-C, P) \nPolicies \nWhen evaluating an applicant\u2019s suitability for a security clearance, the \nadministrative judge must consider the adjudicative guidelines. In addition to brief \nintroductory explanations for each guideline, the adjudicative guidelines list potentially \ndisqualifying conditions and mitigating conditions, which are used in evaluating an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for access to classified information. \nThese guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, these guidelines are applied in conjunction with the \nfactors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. \nThe protection of the national security is the paramount consideration. AG \u00b6 2(b) \nrequires that \u201c[a]ny doubt concerning personnel being considered for national security \neligibility will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d In reaching this decision, I have \ndrawn only those conclusions that are reasonable, logical, and based on the evidence \ncontained in the record. \nUnder Directive \u00b6 E3.1.14, the Government must present evidence to establish \ncontroverted facts alleged in the SOR. Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion to obtain a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation about potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nSection 7 of EO 10865 provides that decisions shall be \u201cin terms of the national \ninterest and shall in no sense be a determination as to the loyalty of the applicant \nconcerned.\u201d See also EO 12968, Section 3.1(b) (listing multiple prerequisites for access \nto classified or sensitive information). \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 expresses the security concern for financial considerations: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. \nAffluence that cannot be explained by known sources of income is also a \nsecurity concern insofar as it may result from criminal activity, including \nespionage. \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns. I have \nconsidered all of them under AG \u00b619 and the following potentially apply: \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nApplicant incurred delinquent debts due to having to pay back his ROTC \nscholarship and multiple medical bills. I find both disqualifying conditions are raised. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. I have considered all of the mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 \nand the following potentially apply: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; and \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s debts are recent because they are ongoing and, although he recently \nmade several payments toward his medical debts, with one exception, he only did so \nshortly before his security clearance hearing. He has only made one voluntary payment \nof $300 recently toward his educational recoupment debt. Two of his latest federal tax \nrefunds were captured and applied toward that debt. He failed to produce evidence \nshowing that recurrence of his financial problems is unlikely, in light of his soon to be \nresponsibility to begin paying his $40,000 federal student loans. AG \u00b6 20(a) is not \napplicable. \nWhile Applicant\u2019s medical issues resulting in those debts were circumstances \nbeyond his control, his quitting his college ROTC program, which resulted in him being \nfinancially responsible for paying back his scholarship, was not beyond his control. \nAdditionally, he did not act responsibly concerning the medical debts when he failed to \nattempt to resolve them until the eve of his hearing. AG \u00b6 20(b) is not fully applicable. \nApplicant did not present evidence of financial counseling. His track record to date \ndoes not support a good financial picture. Additionally, he failed to put forth a good-faith \neffort to resolve his debts. With the exception of one documented $300 payment in August \n2021, Applicant\u2019s other recoupment debt payments to the government occurred when his \nfederal tax refunds were captured for tax years 2019 and 2020. This does not constitute \nacting in good faith. All but one payment towards his medical debts did not occur until a \nfew days before his hearing. His actions are too little, too late. Applicant\u2019s financial \nproblems are not under control. AG \u00b6 20(c) does not apply. AG \u00b6 20(d) applies to the \nmedical debts that he has paid or settled. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \n6 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n       \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                               \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guideline and the whole-person concept. \nI considered the potentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all \nrelevant facts and circumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my \ncomments under Guideline F in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 \n2(d) were addressed under that guideline, but some warrant additional comment. \nI considered Applicant\u2019s medical issues, his job performance and his recent debt \npayments. However, I also considered that he waited until the eve of his hearing to take \nany significant action to address his debts. He has not established a meaningful track \nrecord of debt management, which causes me to question his ability to resolve his debts \nin the future. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with question and doubts about Applicant\u2019s \neligibility and suitability for a security clearance. For all these reasons, I conclude \nApplicant has not mitigated the financial considerations security concerns. I considered \nthe exceptions under Security Executive Agent Directive (SEAD) 4, Appendix C, dated \nJune 8, 2017, and determined they are not applicable in this case. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, as \nrequired by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs: 1.a-1b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs: 1.c-1.k: \nFor Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant eligibility for a security \nclearance.

Eligibility for access \nto classified information is denied. \nStatement of the Case \nOn April 25, 2018, Applicant completed and signed his Questionnaires for \nInvestigations Processing or security clearance application (SCA). (Government Exhibit \n(GE) 1) On March 20, 2020, the Department of Defense (DOD) Consolidated \nAdjudications Facility (CAF) issued a statement of reasons (SOR) to Applicant under \nExecutive Order (Exec. Or.) 10865, Safeguarding Classified Information within Industry \n(February 20, 1960); DOD Directive 5220.6, Defense Industrial Personnel Security \nClearance Review Program (Directive) (January 2, 1992), as amended; and Security \nExecutive Agent Directive 4, establishing in Appendix A the National Security Adjudicative \nGuidelines for Determining Eligibility for Access to Classified Information or Eligibility to \nHold a Sensitive Position (AGs), effective June 8, 2017. (Hearing Exhibit (HE) 2) \nThe SOR detailed reasons why the DOD CAF did not find under the Directive that \nit is clearly consistent with the interests of national security to grant or continue a security \nclearance for Applicant and recommended referral to an administrative judge to \n1 \n\ndetermine whether a clearance should be granted, continued, denied, or revoked. \nSpecifically, the SOR set forth security concerns arising under Guideline F (financial \nconsiderations). (HE 2) Applicant provided an undated response to the SOR and \nrequested a hearing. (HE 3) \nOn October 22, 2020, Department Counsel was ready to proceed. Processing of \nthe case was delayed due to COVID-19. On July 12, 2021, the case was assigned to me. \nOn July 23, 2021, DOHA issued a notice of hearing, setting the hearing for July 30, 2021. \n(Hearing Exhibit (HE) 1) Applicant waived his right under the Directive to 15 days of notice \nof the date, time, and location of the hearing. (Transcript (Tr.) 11) His hearing was held \nas scheduled in the vicinity of Arlington, Virginia using the U.S. Cyber Command video \nteleconference system. (Id.) \nDuring the hearing, Department Counsel offered nine exhibits. (Government \nExhibits (GE) 1-GE 9) Applicant did not offer any exhibits. There were no objections, and \nall proffered exhibits were admitted into evidence. (Tr. 15-17; GE 1-GE 9) \nOn August 11, 2021, DOHA received a transcript of the hearing. The record closed \non September 15, 2021. (Tr. 10, 43, 45; HE 2) No documents were received after \nApplicant\u2019s hearing. \nSome details were excluded to protect Applicant\u2019s right to privacy. Specific \ninformation is available in the cited exhibits and transcript. ISCR and ADP decisions and \nthe Directive are available at https://doha.ogc.osd.mil/. \nFindings of Fact \nIn Applicant\u2019s SOR response, he admitted the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a, 1.b, 1.d \nthrough 1.g, and 1.l. He denied the allegations in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.c, 1.h. 1.i, 1.j, and 1.k. (HE 3) \nHe also provided mitigating information. (Id.) His admissions are accepted as findings of \nfact. \nApplicant is a 32-year-old former employee of a DOD contractor, and he has been \nemployed in information technology support for about 15 years. (Tr. 6-7) From April to \nJune 2021, he was unemployed, and he is currently a benefits coordinator for an \ninsurance company. (Tr. 19, 39-40) He is sponsored for a security clearance. (Tr. 19-20) \nIn 2007, Applicant graduated from high school. (Tr. 6) He completed three years \nof college. (Tr. 7, 20-21) He has not served in the military. (Tr. 7) He has never married, \nand he does not have any children. (Tr. 7) \nFinancial Considerations \nApplicant was unemployed in 2015 or 2016 for about six months. (Tr. 40) In 2017, \nhe was unemployed for about three months. (Tr. 40) He said that the source of his \nfinancial problems was insufficient income. The SOR alleges financial consideration \n2 \n\nsecurity concerns based on 12 delinquent debts totaling $86,835. The status of each \nallegation is as follows. \nSOR \u00b6 1.a alleges a $69,383 delinquent federal student loan. Applicant attended \na university from 2007 to 2011. (Tr. 20) He received some student-loan deferments from \n2011 to 2017 due to lack of income. (Tr. 23) He did not provide copies of his requests for \nstudent-loan deferments. In 2014, he made six payments totaling about $250. (GE 8) In \n2015, he made four payments totaling $220. (Id.) He said he made some payments in \n2017, became unemployed, and stopped making payments; however, no payments are \nshown in 2017 on his student-loan account statement. (Tr. 22; GE 8) In July 2018, he \nstarted a loan rehabilitation program in which he agreed to pay $123 monthly for nine \nmonths. (Tr. 24) He made eight $123 payments, there was a five-month gap without \npayments, and then he made a $175 payment on April 17, 2020. (Tr. 24-25) On March \n21, 2021, his consolidated student-loan account was transferred, and he was supposed \nto receive a new payment schedule; however, it had not arrived by the date of his hearing. \n(Tr. 27; GE 9) According to his July 28, 2021 credit report, Applicant currently owes about \n$107,000 in student loans. (Tr. 22, 26; GE 6) According to his March 21, 2021 student-\nloan account statement, his student loan balance is $177,340. (GE 8) For purposes of \nthis decision, I have indicated the current student-loan balance is $107,000. \nSOR \u00b6 1.b alleges a delinquent student loan owed to a university for $1,510. \nApplicant\u2019s August 30, 2019 credit report shows the debt was first listed in January 2017. \n(GE 4) He enrolled in a university and received a laptop computer; however, after about \ntwo months, he stopped attending classes. (Tr. 28) Applicant said he returned the laptop \ncomputer; however, the university said they did not receive it. (Tr. 29) Applicant disputes \nhis responsibility for the debt. (Tr. 29) He had some emails about the dispute that he \nintended to provide for inclusion in the record; however, they were not received. (Tr. 29) \nThe debt is not listed on his July 28, 2021 credit report. (GE 6) I have credited him with \nsuccessfully disputing the debt. \nSOR \u00b6 1.c alleges an insurance debt placed for collection for $796. Applicant made \ntwo $50 payments, and his credit report shows a balance of $696. (Tr. 30) He indicated \nhe would check into the debt. (Tr. 30) \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d, 1.e, 1.g, 1.k, and 1.l allege five medical debts placed for collection or \n120 days past due for $147, $145, $773, $787, and $1,183. Applicant said he paid the \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.d and 1.e, and his July 28, 2021 credit report shows the debt in SOR \n\u00b6 1.e ($145) as paid. (Tr. 31; GE 6) The debt for $773 may have been incorrectly billed, \nand Applicant said he would check on the amount owed. (Tr. 34) In 2018, he said he \nintended to make payment arrangements for the $787 debt. (GE 1) He said he paid the \n$1,183 debt, and he would provide proof of payment after his hearing. (Tr. 36) He did not \nprovide any documentation concerning the five medical debts. \nSOR \u00b6 1.f alleges a student loan debt placed for collection owed to a technical \ninstitute for $6,924. Applicant completed the one-year technical-institute course. (Tr. 31) \nAround October 2020, Applicant set up an automatic payment plan from a credit card. \n(Tr. 33) Applicant said he made about two $100 payments to address the debt. (Tr. 32) \n3 \n\nHe said he would check on the account. (Tr. 33) He did not provide documentary evidence \nof the two $100 payments or showing his payment arrangements. \nSOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.j allege telecommunication debts placed for collection for $1,966 \nand $1,436. Applicant said the debts involved changing cell-phone plans, and he disputed \nhis responsibility for the two debts. (Tr. 35-36) He did not provide correspondence to or \nfrom the creditors about the disputes. In his April 25, 2018 SCA, Applicant disclosed the \ndebts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h and 1.j. (GE 1) He indicated the debts became delinquent in 2010 to \n2011. (Id.) He said that the debts are in collections, are disputed, and should have fallen \noff of his credit report. (Id.) His July 28, 2021 credit report does not list these three \naccounts. I have credited him with successfully disputing these two debts. \nSOR \u00b6 1.i alleges a debt owed to a landlord placed for collection for $1,785. \nApplicant\u2019s roommate moved out, and he could not afford the rent by himself. (Tr. 36) He \nbelieved he should not be responsible for the remainder of the debt. (Tr. 36) In his April \n25, 2018 SCA, Applicant disclosed the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.i. (GE 1) He indicated this debt \nbecame delinquent in 2010 or 2011. (Id.) He said that the debts are in collections, are \ndisputed, and should have fallen off of his credit report. (Id.) His July 28, 2021 credit report \ndoes not list this debt. I have credited him with successfully disputing this debt. \nApplicant\u2019s net monthly pay is about $3,000, and it varies based on commissions. \n(Tr. 38) His monthly expenses include rent of $1,650 and a $594 car payment. (Tr. 38) \nHis monthly remainder sometimes is about $200. (Tr. 39) He has not had financial \ncounseling. (Tr. 39) \nPolicies \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has recognized the substantial discretion of the Executive \nBranch in regulating access to information pertaining to national security emphasizing, \n\u201cno one has a \u2018right\u2019 to a security clearance.\u201d Department of the Navy v. Egan, 484 U.S. \n518, 528 (1988). As Commander in Chief, the President has the authority to control \naccess to information bearing on national security and to determine whether an individual \nis sufficiently trustworthy to have access to such information.\u201d Id. at 527. The President \nhas authorized the Secretary of Defense or his designee to grant applicant\u2019s eligibility for \naccess to classified information \u201conly upon a finding that it is clearly consistent with the \nnational interest to do so.\u201d Exec. Or. 10865. \nEligibility for a security clearance is predicated upon the applicant meeting the \ncriteria contained in the adjudicative guidelines. These guidelines are not inflexible rules \nof law. Instead, recognizing the complexities of human behavior, these guidelines are \napplied in conjunction with an evaluation of the whole person. An administrative judge\u2019s \noverarching adjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. An \nadministrative judge must consider all available, reliable information about the person, \npast and present, favorable and unfavorable. \nThe Government reposes a high degree of trust and confidence in persons with \naccess to classified information. This relationship transcends normal duty hours and \n4 \n\n \nendures throughout off-duty hours. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the \npossible risk the applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified \ninformation. Such decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation \nabout potential, rather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. Clearance \ndecisions must be \u201cin terms of the national interest and shall in no sense be a \ndetermination as to the loyalty of the applicant concerned.\u201d See Exec. Or. 10865 \u00a7 7. \nThus, nothing in this decision should be construed to suggest that it is based, in whole or \nin part, on any express or implied determination about applicant\u2019s allegiance, loyalty, or \npatriotism. It is merely an indication the applicant has not met the strict guidelines the \nPresident, Secretary of Defense, and DNI have established for issuing a clearance. \nInitially, the Government must establish, by substantial evidence, conditions in the \npersonal or professional history of the applicant that may disqualify the applicant from \nbeing eligible for access to classified information. The Government has the burden of \nestablishing controverted facts alleged in the SOR. See Egan, 484 U.S. at 531. \n\u201cSubstantial evidence\u201d is \u201cmore than a scintilla but less than a preponderance.\u201d See v. \nWashington Metro. Area Transit Auth., 36 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir. 1994). The guidelines \npresume a nexus or rational connection between proven conduct under any of the criteria \nlisted therein and an applicant\u2019s security suitability. See ISCR Case No. 95-0611 at 2 \n(App. Bd. May 2, 1996). \nOnce the Government establishes a disqualifying condition by substantial \nevidence, the burden shifts to the applicant to rebut, explain, extenuate, or mitigate the \nfacts. Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. An applicant \u201chas the ultimate burden of demonstrating that it \nis clearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue his [or her] security \nclearance.\u201d ISCR Case No. 01-20700 at 3 (App. Bd. Dec. 19, 2002). The burden of \ndisproving a mitigating condition never shifts to the Government. See ISCR Case No. 02-\n31154 at 5 (App. Bd. Sep. 22, 2005). \u201c[S]ecurity clearance determinations should err, if \nthey must, on the side of denials.\u201d Egan, 484 U.S. at 531; see AG \u00b6 2(b). \nAnalysis \nFinancial Considerations \nAG \u00b6 18 articulates the security concern for financial problems: \nFailure to live within one\u2019s means, satisfy debts, and meet financial\nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or\nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise\nquestions about an individual\u2019s reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. . . . An individual who is financially \noverextended is at greater risk of having to engage in illegal or otherwise \nquestionable acts to generate funds. . . . \n \n \n \nThe Appeal Board explained the scope and rationale for the financial \nconsiderations security concern in ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012) \n(citation omitted) as follows: \n5 \n\n \n \n \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an applicant might \nknowingly compromise classified information in order to raise money in \nsatisfaction of his or her debts. Rather, it requires a Judge to examine the \ntotality of an applicant\u2019s financial history and circumstances. The Judge \nmust consider pertinent evidence regarding the applicant\u2019s self-control, \njudgment, and other qualities essential to protecting the national secrets as \nwell as the vulnerabilities inherent in the circumstances. The Directive \npresumes a nexus between proven conduct under any of the Guidelines \nand an applicant\u2019s security eligibility. \nA debt that became delinquent several years ago is still considered recent because \n\u201can applicant\u2019s ongoing, unpaid debts evidence a continuing course of conduct and, \ntherefore, can be viewed as recent for purposes of the Guideline F mitigating conditions.\u201d \nISCR Case No. 15-06532 at 3 (App. Bd. Feb. 16, 2017) (citing ISCR Case No. 15-01690 \nat 2 (App. Bd. Sept. 13, 2016)). \nAG \u00b6 19 includes disqualifying conditions that could raise a security concern and \nmay be disqualifying in this case: \u201c(a) inability to satisfy debts\u201d; and \u201c(c) a history of not \nmeeting financial obligations.\u201d The record establishes AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) and 19(c). Further \ndiscussion of the disqualifying conditions is in the mitigation section, infra. \nAG \u00b6 20 lists financial considerations mitigating conditions which may be applicable \nin this case: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \n(c) the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling for the \nproblem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit credit \ncounseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem is being \nresolved or is under control; \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts; and \n(e) the individual has a reasonable basis to dispute the legitimacy of the \npast-due debt which is the cause of the problem and provides documented \nproof to substantiate the basis of the dispute or provides evidence of actions \nto resolve the issue. \n6 \n\nIn ISCR Case No. 10-04641 at 4 (App. Bd. Sept. 24, 2013), the DOHA Appeal \nBoard concisely explained Applicant\u2019s responsibility for proving the applicability of \nmitigating conditions as follows: \nOnce a concern arises regarding an Applicant\u2019s security clearance \neligibility, there is a strong presumption against the grant or maintenance of \na security clearance. See Dorfmont v. Brown, 913 F. 2d 1399, 1401 (9th \nCir. 1990), cert. denied, 499 U.S. 905 (1991). After the Government \npresents evidence raising security concerns, the burden shifts to the \napplicant to rebut or mitigate those concerns. See Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15. The \nstandard applicable in security clearance decisions is that articulated in \nEgan, supra. \u201cAny doubt concerning personnel being considered for access \nto classified information will be resolved in favor of the national security.\u201d \nDirective, Enclosure 2 \u00b6 2(b). \nThe SOR alleges 12 delinquent debts totaling $86,835. In the last 10 years, \nApplicant paid about $2,000 to address his student loan debts. According to credit reports, \nhis student loan debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.a and 1.f now total about $114,000. He did not provide \nproof of any payments to any of the SOR creditors except for the account statement \npertaining to SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nSeveral of Applicant\u2019s delinquent debts have been either charged off or dropped \nfrom his credit report. When a debt is dropped off of a credit report, it does not necessarily \nestablish mitigation of the debt. The Fair Credit Reporting Act requires removal of most \nnegative financial items from a credit report seven years from the first date of delinquency \nor the debt becoming collection barred because of a state statute of limitations, whichever \nis longer. See Title 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681c. See Federal Trade Commission website, \nSummary \nof \nFair \nCredit \nReporting \nAct \nUpdates \nat \nSection \n605, \nhttps://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/pdf-0111-fair-credit-reporting-act.pdf. Debts may \nbe dropped from a credit report upon dispute when creditors believe debts are not going \nto be paid, a creditor fails to timely respond to a credit reporting company\u2019s request for \ninformation, or when the debt has been charged off. \nIn his April 25, 2018 SCA, Applicant disclosed the debts in SOR \u00b6 1.h ($1,996),\n1.i ($1,785), and 1.j ($1,436). The debts resulted from transfers of cell phone accounts\nand his inability to pay rent after his roommate moved. He indicated the debts became\ndelinquent in 2010 to 2011. He said that the debts were disputed, and his July 28, 2021\ncredit report does not list these three accounts. I have credited Applicant with mitigating\nthe debts in SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.h, 1.i, and 1.j because the likely resolution is the creditors elected\nnot to pursue collection. Similarly, he said he disputed the debt owed to the university for\n$1,510, and it has been removed from his credit report. I have credited him with mitigation \nof the debt in SOR \u00b6 1.b. I have credited Applicant with mitigating SOR \u00b6 1.e, a medical\ndebt for $145, because his July 28, 2021 credit report showed the debt was paid. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAs to the seven remaining SOR debts, Applicant did not provide documentation \nsuch as: (1) proof of payments, for example, checking account statements, photocopies \nof checks, or a letter from the creditor proving that he paid or made any payments to the \n7 \n\ncreditor; (2) correspondence to or from the creditor to establish maintenance of contact; \n(3) copies of credible debt disputes sent to the creditor and/or credit reporting companies \nindicating he did not believe he was responsible for the debt and why he held such a \nbelief; (4) evidence of attempts to negotiate payment plans, for example, settlement offers \nor agreements to show that he was attempting to resolve a debt; or (5) other evidence of \nprogress or resolution. \nIn order for Applicant to qualify for mitigation under the \u201cgood faith\u201d mitigating \ncondition, he must present evidence showing either a good-faith effort to repay overdue \ncreditors or some other good-faith action aimed at resolving his debts. The concept of \ngood faith requires him to establish that he acted in a way that shows reasonableness, \nprudence, honesty, and adherence to duty or obligation. He did not provide documented \nproof of the basis of the disputes or actions to resolve the issue, except for SOR \u00b6 1.a. \nAG \u00b6 20(d) is not fully applicable with respect to any of the debts discussed in the facts. \nApplicant\u2019s unemployment and underemployment reduced his ability to pay his \ndebts; however, he did not act responsibly under the circumstances. He did not provide \ndocumentation showing that he maintained contact with his creditors and attempted to \nestablish payment plans. He failed to make sufficient progress resolving his delinquent \ndebts. He did not show he made responsible, prudent, and good-faith financial decisions. \nDelinquent debts are likely to remain unresolved. He failed to establish mitigation of \nfinancial considerations security concerns. \nWhole-Person Concept \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the Applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all the circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the nine \nadjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d): \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of rehabilitation \nand other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation for the conduct; \n(8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or duress; and (9) the \nlikelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), \u201c[t]he ultimate determination\u201d of whether to grant a security \nclearance \u201cmust be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful consideration \nof the guidelines\u201d and the whole-person concept. My comments under Guideline F are \nincorporated in my whole-person analysis. Some of the factors in AG \u00b6 2(d) were \naddressed under that guideline but some warrant additional comment. \nApplicant is a 32-year-old former employee of a DOD contractor. He has been \nemployed in information technology support for about 15 years. From April to June 2021, \n8 \n\n_________________________ \nhe was unemployed, and he is currently a benefits coordinator for an insurance company. \nHe completed three years of college. \nApplicant owes seven delinquent SOR debts totaling about $117,600. He made \nabout $2,000 in payments to address his student loans over the past 10 years. He paid a \nmedical debt for $145. Four SOR debts were successfully disputed. He did not establish \na track record of debt payments for seven SOR debts. He did not provide documentation \nshowing that he took reasonable, prudent, and good-faith actions to communicate with \nhis creditors and to establish payment plans. He did not meet his burden of proving he is \nfinancially responsible. \nIt is well settled that once a concern arises regarding an applicant\u2019s security \nclearance eligibility, there is a strong presumption against granting a security clearance. \nSee Dorfmont, 913 F. 2d at 1401. I have carefully applied the law, as set forth in Egan, \nExec. Or. 10865, the Directive, the AGs, and the Appeal Board\u2019s jurisprudence to the \nfacts and circumstances in the context of the whole person. Unmitigated financial \nconsiderations security concerns relating to his handling of his delinquent debts lead me \nto conclude that grant of a security clearance to Applicant is not warranted at this time. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings For or Against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by Section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F: \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraph 1.a: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.b: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c and 1.d: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraph 1.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f and 1.g: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.h, 1.i, and 1.j: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.k and 1.l: \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant or continue Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance. Eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nMark Harvey \nAdministrative Judge \n9 \n",

Egan, 484 U.S. 518, 531 (1988). \nThe adjudicative guidelines are not inflexible rules of law. Instead, recognizing the \ncomplexities of human behavior, administrative judges apply the guidelines in conjunction \nwith the factors listed in the adjudicative process. The administrative judge\u2019s overarching \nadjudicative goal is a fair, impartial, and commonsense decision. According to AG \u00b6 2(a), \nthe entire process is a conscientious scrutiny of a number of variables known as the \n\u201cwhole-person concept.\u201d The administrative judge must consider all available, reliable \ninformation about the person, past and present, favorable and unfavorable, in making a \ndecision. The protection of the national security is the paramount consideration.

Under Directive \u00b6 E3.1.15, an \u201capplicant is \nresponsible for presenting witnesses and other evidence to rebut, explain, extenuate, or \nmitigate facts admitted by applicant or proven by Department Counsel, and has the \nultimate burden of persuasion as to obtaining a favorable security decision.\u201d \nA person who seeks access to classified information enters into a fiduciary \nrelationship with the Government predicated upon trust and confidence. This relationship \ntranscends normal duty hours and endures throughout off-duty hours. The Government \nreposes a high degree of trust and confidence in individuals to whom it grants access to \nclassified information. Decisions include, by necessity, consideration of the possible risk \nthat an applicant may deliberately or inadvertently fail to safeguard classified information. \nSuch decisions entail a certain degree of legally permissible extrapolation as to potential, \nrather than actual, risk of compromise of classified information. \nAnalysis \nGuideline F, Financial Considerations \nThe security concern relating to the guideline for financial considerations is set out \nin AG \u00b6 18: \nFailure to live within one's means, satisfy debts, and meet financial \nobligations may indicate poor self-control, lack of judgment, or \nunwillingness to abide by rules and regulations, all of which can raise \nquestions about an individual's reliability, trustworthiness, and ability to \nprotect classified or sensitive information. Financial distress can also be \ncaused or exacerbated by, and thus can be a possible indicator of, other \nissues of personnel security concern such as excessive gambling, mental \nhealth conditions, substance misuse, or alcohol abuse or dependence. An \nindividual who is financially overextended is at greater risk of having to \nengage in illegal or otherwise questionable acts to generate funds. . . . \nThis concern is broader than the possibility that an individual might knowingly \ncompromise classified information in order to raise money. It encompasses concerns \nabout an individual\u2019s self-control, judgment, and other qualities essential to protecting \nclassified information. An individual who is financially irresponsible may also be \nirresponsible, unconcerned, or negligent in handling and safeguarding classified \ninformation. ISCR Case No. 11-05365 at 3 (App. Bd. May 1, 2012). \nThe guideline notes several conditions that could raise security concerns under \nAG \u00b6 19. The following are potentially applicable in this case: \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n(a) inability to satisfy debts; and  \n(c) a history of not meeting financial obligations. \nThe SOR debts are established by the credit reports in the record. AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) \nand 19(c) apply. \nThe guideline also includes conditions that could mitigate security concerns arising \nfrom financial difficulties. The following mitigating conditions under AG \u00b6 20 are potentially \napplicable: \n(a) the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or occurred \nunder such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not cast doubt \non the individual\u2019s current reliability, trustworthiness, or good judgment; \n(b) the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were largely beyond \nthe person\u2019s control (e.g., loss of employment, a business downturn, \nunexpected medical emergency, or a death, divorce or separation, clear \nvictimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; and  \n(d) the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to repay \noverdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant\u2019s SOR indebtedness runs from 2016, and it continues to this day. \nApplicant\u2019s indebtedness was neither infrequent nor long ago. AG \u00b6 20(a) does not apply. \nThere is nothing in the record showing that Applicant has initiated and is making efforts \nto resolve his overdue debts. AG \u00b6 20(d) does not apply. \nIt is undisputed that Applicant\u2019s indebtedness was caused by serious health \nconditions beyond his control. The first prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. The next inquiry, \nhowever, is whether Applicant acted responsibly under the adverse circumstances he \nwas facing. There is nothing in the record showing that Applicant made any efforts to \naddress his overdue debts. He apparently did not contact or otherwise reach out to his \noverdue creditors to advise them of the causes of his delinquent debts. I cannot find that \nthe second prong of AG \u00b6 20(b) applies. Therefore, I find against Applicant on SOR \u00b6\u00b6 \n1.a. through 1.h. \nThe magnitude of Applicant\u2019s $232 of medical debt does not, in itself, raise \nsecurity concerns. I find in favor of Applicant on SOR \u00b6\u00b6 1.i. through 1.k. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(a), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept.

May 1, 2012). \nApplicant\u2019s admissions, corroborated by his credit reports, establish two \ndisqualifying conditions under this guideline: AG \u00b6\u00b6 19(a) (\u201cinability to satisfy debts\u201d); \n4 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nand 19(c) (\u201ca history of not meeting financial obligations\u201d). \nThe security concerns raised in the SOR may be mitigated by the following \npotentially applicable factors: \n \nAG \u00b6 20(a): the behavior happened so long ago, was so infrequent, or \noccurred under such circumstances that it is unlikely to recur and does not \ncast doubt on the individual's current reliability, trustworthiness, or good \njudgment; \nAG \u00b6 20(b): the conditions that resulted in the financial problem were \nlargely beyond the person's control (e.g., loss of employment, a business \ndownturn, unexpected medical emergency, a death, divorce or separation, \nclear victimization by predatory lending practices, or identity theft), and the \nindividual acted responsibly under the circumstances; \nAG \u00b6 20(c): the individual has received or is receiving financial counseling \nfor the problem from a legitimate and credible source, such as a non-profit \ncredit counseling service, and there are clear indications that the problem \nis being resolved or is under control; and \nAG \u00b6 20(d): the individual initiated and is adhering to a good-faith effort to \nrepay overdue creditors or otherwise resolve debts. \nApplicant admitted, and his credit reports confirm, that he is responsible for the \ndelinquent debts. He blames the debts on his divorce in 2012 and some \nunderemployment and unemployment. He has provided some documentation that \nsupports he is making payments on two accounts. He plans to pay his debts in the \nnext five years. \nBased on the scant evidence produced by Applicant, it is impossible to conclude \nhe made a sufficient good-faith effort to resolve his debts or that his financial situation is \nunder control. Consequently, the Government has cause to question whether Applicant \nhas his finances under control. Despite gainful employment, there is no evidence that \nApplicant has made any payments on any of the remaining delinquent debts. Any \ndoubts must be resolved in favor of the Government. \nWhole-Person Concept \n \nUnder the whole-person concept, the administrative judge must evaluate an \napplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance by considering the totality of the applicant\u2019s \nconduct and all relevant circumstances. The administrative judge should consider the \nnine adjudicative process factors listed at AG \u00b6 2(d):  \n(1) the nature, extent, and seriousness of the conduct; (2) the \ncircumstances surrounding the conduct, to include knowledgeable \n5 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n________________________ \nparticipation; (3) the frequency and recency of the conduct; (4) the \nindividual\u2019s age and maturity at the time of the conduct; (5) the extent to \nwhich participation is voluntary; (6) the presence or absence of \nrehabilitation and other permanent behavioral changes; (7) the motivation \nfor the conduct; (8) the potential for pressure, coercion, exploitation, or \nduress; and (9) the likelihood of continuation or recurrence. \nUnder AG \u00b6 2(c), the ultimate determination of whether to grant eligibility for a \nsecurity clearance must be an overall commonsense judgment based upon careful \nconsideration of the guidelines and the whole-person concept. I considered the \npotentially disqualifying and mitigating conditions in light of all the facts and \ncircumstances surrounding this case. I have incorporated my comments under \nGuideline F in my whole-person analysis. \nApplicant has started to pay on two accounts. He provided some documentation, \nHe served honorably in the U.S. Air Force. He was divorced in 2012. He loves his job. \nHe had some unemployment and underemployment. He did not provide sufficient \nevidence to mitigate the security concerns. \nOverall, the record evidence leaves me with questions and doubts as to \nApplicant\u2019s eligibility for a security clearance. Because protection of the interests of \nnational security is the principal focus of these adjudications, any remaining doubts \nmust be resolved by denying eligibility for access to sensitive information. \nFormal Findings \nFormal findings for or against Applicant on the allegations set forth in the SOR, \nas required by section E3.1.25 of Enclosure 3 of the Directive, are: \nParagraph 1, Guideline F:  \nAGAINST APPLICANT \nSubparagraphs 1.a \u20131.b: \nAgainst Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.c-1.e: \nFor Applicant \nSubparagraphs 1.f-1.l \nAgainst Applicant \nConclusion \nIn light of all of the circumstances presented by the record in this case, it is not \nclearly consistent with the national interest to grant Applicant\u2019s eligibility for a security \nclearance. Continued eligibility for access to classified information is denied. \nNoreen A. Lynch \nAdministrative Judge \n6 \n",
